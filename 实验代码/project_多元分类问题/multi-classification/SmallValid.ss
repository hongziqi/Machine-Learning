LOW		had the pleasure of trying out their new bar menu which is a burger lovers paradise . <sssss> they bring you a clip board , a pencil then you go to town . <sssss> . <sssss> choose the meat , beef , lamb , salmon , and falafel . <sssss> . <sssss> then chose your toppings , from cheese to foie and everything in between . <sssss> . <sssss> the burgers are on the pricey side but do come with either duck fat fries or red onion rings . <sssss> both of the burgers we ordered , beef , medium rare , were very good but the portion to price ratio is off . <sssss> . <sssss> burgers are smallish plus we both had bacon on our burgers -lrb- $ 3 upcharge -rrb- but , it was only one slice cut in half . <sssss> . <sssss> come on , really ? <sssss> for a $ 14 burger plus $ 3 bucks for bacon , put some fucking bacon on it ! <sssss> seriously ! <sssss> while i think i would have given the bar 4 stars i can not based on the price and while tasty , that little shitty piece of bacon .
MID		if you 've never been to downtown gilbert to visit joe 's real bbq , liberty market is another reason to check it out . <sssss> not only are there those 2 destination worthy places to chow , but hale centre theatre which offers live performance theatre for post eating entertainment . <sssss> the icon for downtown gilbert is a massive water tower that is just amazing to stand by . <sssss> i know its just a water tower but the history , being built in 1923 , and the scale , 123 feet tall , it 's quite a sight to stand underneath . <sssss> with a 3 million dollar renovation and new park surrounding the tower , it 's both modern and well , cool . <sssss> here is some good news if you 're a fan of joe 's real bbq or joe 's farm grill ; restaurateur joe johnston also owns liberty market . <sssss> so you 'll know right away that there will be high quality and tasty food at very affordable prices . <sssss> this is also due to the fact that chef david traina and his wife kiersten are pretty much running the show at liberty . <sssss> both were so helpful that we felt like we were honored guests ; as i 'm sure most will feel when visiting . <sssss> chef david came from behind the open kitchen and greeted us personally . <sssss> his gorgeous wife kiersten was so helpful as she had many recommendations from the menu and drink list as we ordered . <sssss> its customer service like this that will not only make you a loyal guest , but you 'll quickly share this experience with your friends . <sssss> built in 1935 the building has been lovingly restored into that retro-american-modern feel that the other restaurants have . <sssss> on a side note , be sure to check out the bathrooms , there are several in which to chose and each has its own theme . <sssss> to get things moving along at liberty you stand in line and place your order at the counter , then they give you a number to place on the table and when your order is ready they bring it out to you . <sssss> there are quite a few places to sit including a large patio , main indoor dining room and a long bar overlooking the wood-burning oven . <sssss> this is the place to be if you love to see your dinner being made before your eyes , its up close and very personal . <sssss> depending on what time of day you go the menu has its bases covered . <sssss> from the coffee bar to a fun and interesting breakfast menu as well as the main menu , you might be hard pressed to just order one thing . <sssss> the main menu is comprised of sandwiches , pizza 's , salads and cold case offerings such a fresh hummus and potato salad . <sssss> you may also be happy to know that they serve beer and wine to compliment your dinner choices , priced so well that you may want to try more than one if you 're not driving . <sssss> be sure to take a look at the wall of kitschy gift items like bear shaped salt and peppershakers and party snaps . <sssss> who did n't play with those when they were a kid ? <sssss> being all about fresh and local we started with the antipasto -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- , which was large enough to share between 4 big eaters . <sssss> a large serving platter covered in molinari and sons cured meats , roasted brussels sprouts , baby carrots , olives and slices of artisanal cheese were a delight . <sssss> the grilled bread that came with the platter was a nice compliment to the deliciously salty cured meats . <sssss> instead of ordering the caprese salad -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- we opted for the caprese sandwich -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , which even came with a cold case side dish . <sssss> the corn , tomato + bean side was a bounty of freshness from the crunchy corn to the smooth toothsome navy beans . <sssss> this was a real compliment to the wonderful flavors of the mozzarella , sliced tomato , fresh basil and balsamic on the sandwich . <sssss> the liberty joe -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- is a take on the classic sloppy joe enjoyed by millions of kids over the years . <sssss> tender ground beef in a rich and hearty tomato sauce a top a toasted bun , lots of love for this one . <sssss> mac and cheese was the only side that could have been chosen for this one , kid heaven ! <sssss> the pizza 's are all hand tossed and baked in a beautiful renato wood-burning oven . <sssss> the pizza crusts that come from this oven are lightly crisp , slightly charred and simply scrumptious ! <sssss> starting with the white -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- this one is not to be missed ! <sssss> if the combination of cream sauce and smoked mozzarella was n't enough , wait till you taste the chopped bacon and tender pieces of chicken , oolala ! <sssss> another sure fire hit was the grilled sausage -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- covered in stringy mozzarella , roasted onions and tomato sauce . <sssss> while the molinari -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- sounded great , the cooking of sliced cured meats makes them way to salty and intense for my taste , gamey . <sssss> desserts vary from day to day , so on our visit we had the pleasure of a slab of red velvet cake -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> if you 've never had red velvet , please do . <sssss> moist chocolate cake covered in thick frosting of cream cheese delight . <sssss> if you 're in the mood for something a little different , order the bread pudding -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> this was probably the lightest bread pudding i 've ever had , which was more like french toast pillows swimming in a sea of creamy love . <sssss> load up the car with friends and go ahead , make the trip to gilbert and see what you had no idea existed .
MID		the heat was intense against the back of my neck . <sssss> i could feel the sweat running down into the collar of my shirt and racing to the center of my back . <sssss> as i looked at my friends across the table from me , their eyes were closed in fear of certain blindness , the sun was the enemy . <sssss> all seemed okay once their sunglasses were positioned and the drinks arrived , though the heat from the north side of the restaurant was still there . <sssss> gallons of sangria could only temper the heat yet never conquers ; we leave that for the soon coming night . <sssss> i know i know , it sounds like a horrible start to a horrible experience , it was n't really , i swear . <sssss> only a quirk in the new breakfast , lunch and dinner eatery located inside of the clarendon hotel . <sssss> to be fair they were pretty busy and there were n't too many seating options available to us at the time , so we took what we were offered . <sssss> the space is lined both the east and north sides with large windows that allow for great light and heat . <sssss> so if you 're fair skinned like myself or you 're vampire , ask to be sat somewhere away from the windows or you might not have an unpleasant experience . <sssss> okay , moving on now . <sssss> like at many mexican food restaurants you 'll be served chips and salsa but gb does it so much better . <sssss> not only are the chips thick and crispy but also there are 4 different salsas to dip from including a smooth and creamy green salsa , which was a hit at the table . <sssss> be warned though , both red salsas are on the spicy side and while i love spicy be warned . <sssss> if you 'd like to have more fun dipping those deliciously crunchy chips , order the guacamole -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- . <sssss> this dip is far chunkier and interesting with nice large cubes of avocado and chili that 'll give your chips reason and purpose . <sssss> the taste is superb and fresh , it should be since each bowl is made when the order is placed , good stuff ! <sssss> have you ever heard of chicharrón ? <sssss> in latin american chicharrón has many recipes but in its simplest , it 's fried pork skin a.k.a. pork cracklin 's or pork rinds . <sssss> hope i have n't lost you here because gb does a cool thing with this idea . <sssss> instead of fatty pork skin they use cheese and instead of fry they griddle the cheese till it 's nice and crunchy then they shape it into a cone while it 's still hot . <sssss> the chicharrón de queso -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- is then served with an aji aioli . <sssss> what better to have cheese with than mayo , right ? <sssss> the deeply flavored cheese is also great with salsa and the guacamole . <sssss> i can honestly say from a foodie perspective , tacos are as perfect as pizza . <sssss> there 's a balance of flavors and textures that really get me growling for more and gb do n't disappoint . <sssss> at $ 2 each you have a choice of pork , steak , and veggie . <sssss> all are served on a fresh made corn tortilla and each with their very own adornments . <sssss> the fish tacos are made with eco friendly fish , i guess they drive hybrid vehicles , and are market priced . <sssss> shaved lettuce , pico de gallo and guacamole shored this tasty taco . <sssss> the carne asada is made with grilled ribeye and has a covering of charred tomato salsa . <sssss> since these are only $ 2 each , why not try them all ? <sssss> all the taco flavors can be also ordered as a torta for $ 7 . <sssss> hot grilled telera bread piled high with tender ribeye and avocado was a sheer pleasure to eat . <sssss> well balanced bread to meat ratio and with just enough toppings to make the sandwich hold together perfectly . <sssss> the tortas are ala carte so you might want to go ahead and order a side of french fries -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- , which are house cut and well seasoned and are a wonderful compliment . <sssss> of course they have one american favorite and they do it really well and that 's the cheeseburger -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- . <sssss> this is after all a breakfast , lunch and dinner hotel restaurant so i think it 's a given to have this on this menu . <sssss> perfectly cooked in all its great beefiness , this is an outstanding cheeseburger and even comes with french fries . <sssss> gb ca n't all be spicy and savory ; they also make some wonderful desserts that are worth saving room for . <sssss> take the tender crepas con cajeta -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- which takes crepes , sliced bananas and peanuts then stacks them up for a nice sharable dessert . <sssss> though the peanuts were a bit chewy , i think crunchy peanuts would have made a better contrast , it 's a personal taste though . <sssss> my to die for favorite was the postre de chocolate -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- which is a glass filled with creamy smooth house made chocolate pudding , then tops it with graham cracker pieces and marshmallow fluff . <sssss> seriously fantastic , all you need is a campfire , oh wait , the heat on the back of my neck will do . <sssss> gallo blanco is working on the sun issue and will soon have shades as well as an outdoor patio . <sssss> a new place is always a work in progress and gallo blanco is certainly worth using a little bit of sunscreen in the meantime .
LOW		you know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same ? <sssss> juts a little fuzzy around the edges , not as sharp but usable ? <sssss> that is how i felt at the new location of market bistro . <sssss> similar vibe that i enjoy at the original is n't quite as pulled together at this location . <sssss> maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables ? <sssss> or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace -lrb- front entrance -rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill ? <sssss> no forks ? <sssss> i 'm sorry if i sound like a banging on mb . <sssss> . <sssss> but these are things that can be improved on . <sssss> the mr and i shared a salad and a cuban sandwich . <sssss> . <sssss> the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making . <sssss> . <sssss> this was probably the best salad ive made to date . <sssss> . <sssss> you should be able to patent your creations ! <sssss> the cuban sandwich was okay . <sssss> . <sssss> the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back . <sssss> . <sssss> for a cuban sandwich i think it had some sort of asian spice , like cardemom ?? <sssss> anyway , the mr did n't like it at all . <sssss> this being his first time he was confused as to why i went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad , then it all made sense to him . <sssss> the salads are just so complete and delicious ! <sssss> i look forward to coming again . <sssss> . <sssss> i just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely .
MID		does anyone remember price club ? <sssss> back when i was a wee lad my mother would make a monthly pilgrimage to the price club about once a month to stock up on kool aid and toilet bowl cleaner . <sssss> i was always so amazed going there as the ceilings were are high as i had ever seen . <sssss> i felt so small and amazed that there was so much for everyone . <sssss> now as a large adult i still get that same feeling going into costco . <sssss> so much for so little and enough for everyone . <sssss> i just love costco , friendly staff and huge aisles though i do n't think that matters much cause most are so much in awe at costco they just stand there in the middle of the aisle . <sssss> who can blame them . <sssss> . <sssss> they feel the love .
HIG		i have to go on the record as saying that this place is great ! <sssss> the mr and i were out in qc picking up porky bits at the pork shop and wanted to try something new out there . <sssss> seeing that this place has been on my radar for ages it was about to to give it a try . <sssss> i am kind of surprised that no one has been out here and yelped it yet . <sssss> this place is amazing !! <sssss> chef driven , artisan , seasonal menu and specials with great pricing it does n't get much better than this . <sssss> after browsing their farmers market -lrb- saturdays only -rrb- and being greeted by an really super nice guy -lrb- i 'm presuming one of the owners -rrb- we had a really good vibe on the place . <sssss> the inside is both comfortable and relaxed with led zepplin and the beatles playing in the background . <sssss> we started with the warm prosciutto wrapped house made mozzarella -lrb- $ 4.50 -rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> all i have to say is that i wish i had a nice glass of red to go with this tasty treat ! <sssss> the prosciutto was awesome but the house pulled mozzarella , to die for ! <sssss> in fact it was so good we asked to buy a pound to go ! <sssss> on the plate was also a nice slathering of pesto to compliment each bite . <sssss> . <sssss> this stuff should be jarred and sold ! <sssss> if i would n't come off as rude and desperate i would have easily licked the plate . <sssss> next up we shared a side of their house made dill pickles -lrb- $ 1.50 -rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> a nice bowl filled with tender well spiced pickles . <sssss> . <sssss> man , i sure love a nice pickle ! <sssss> juicy with slightly crunchy tenderness these were so good i just about scarfed the bowl myself . <sssss> next up we ordered marinated mushroom -lrb- $ 3.50 -rrb- which came with toasted slices of simply bread cibatta . <sssss> each tender bite was a flavor explosion of earthy sweet balsamic tastiness , here comes that wine craving again . <sssss> the deal here is that i 'm low carbin ' so it took some restraint not to tear into the bread with the mushrooms . <sssss> fortunately the mr isnt low carbin ' so i was able to live vicariously through him , he shook his head in pleasure . <sssss> up next were our lunch entrees , the mr had the 1/2 cuban sandwich and a bowl of soup -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . <sssss> the soup was sausage white bean that i could smell from across the table . <sssss> he went ahead and got me a nice spoon full of seasoned broth and a large thick slice of sausage . <sssss> okay there is soup and there is soup , this was excellent . <sssss> hot , creamy and deeply satisfying this was one of the quality your italian grandmother would have made for you as a kid ! <sssss> the cuban sandwich was huge tender slices of roast pork , ham melted provolone , house sweet pickles , dijon aioli on ciabatta bread . <sssss> uh , come on now , seriously ? <sssss> this is just about everything you could ask for in a sandwhich . <sssss> chewy fresh baked bread , hot slices of slightly salty meats and melted cheese , major love was dripping from this sandwich . <sssss> my lunch was the chopped chef salad w / romaine hearts , turkey , bacon , tomatoes , cucumbers , egg , red onion , avocado & blue cheese dressing -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- . <sssss> low cabin ' does n't get much better than this ! <sssss> each bite was absolutely different with combination of so many fresh and tasty ingredients . <sssss> pay close attention to the turkey , they roast it in house along with the roast pork in the cuban . <sssss> they take simple ingredients and combine them to create such delicious hearty flavors all working in unison . <sssss> while the deli is out of the way it is so worth the drive to queen creek for lunch or dinner . <sssss> please take the drive , i seriously do n't think you 're going to be disappointed one bit !
MID		inner vietnamese woman strikes again ! <sssss> who knew that a vietnamese place can have an upscale feel while still being delicious ? <sssss> the mr and i finally visited this place and both were pretty much blown away by the space and the food , this certainly raises the ante for the already established vietnamese places . <sssss> since we have never been before we ordered our asses off the smallish but well written menu . <sssss> started with egg rolls , these were top drawer complete with fresh lettuce and mint to wrap and dip into the nc chm , amazingly delicious , fresh and piping hot against the cool veggies . <sssss> . <sssss> seriously , food like this can make you horny ! <sssss> next up was the hai nam chicken also known as chicken rice . <sssss> . <sssss> outstanding garlic rice with boiled chicken and a ginger dipping sauce . <sssss> each bite can be customized with chili and ginger sauce , my mouth is watering just thinking about this dish !! <sssss> bò kho is one of my all time favorite vietnamese dishes . <sssss> if you arent familiar its basically a wonderful beef stew with either noodles or french bread . <sssss> the pho ao sen version is one of the best versions in the valley . <sssss> you can tell this one is made form scratch , not from a base like other cheater versions around the valley . <sssss> each bite was thick and rich with nice pieces of fatty beef and carrot . <sssss> i only wish they would have added some potato though the egg noodles were just fine by me ! <sssss> now what is going to a vietnamese place without ordering bun cha ha noi ? <sssss> pho ao sen makes one of the most elegant version ive seen with a compartmentalized plate showing off each component . <sssss> this plate both brought us to ooo 's and ahhh 's . <sssss> . <sssss> then the fun begins assembling the rice noodles , bbq pork and the various fresh veggies into a lettuce leaf . <sssss> . <sssss> each bite was different from the last by using nc chm , chile , and hoisen sauce . <sssss> simple and delicious !! <sssss> unfortunately we did not see that they serve wine or beer which would have made this place a perfect destination . <sssss> however they have a nice selection of different beverages including one of my favorites thai tea . <sssss> sweetened tea topped with milk while basic is great at putting out the chile fires in your mouth ! <sssss> we also tried something we never had before . <sssss> . <sssss> soda sa ht gà which essentially is vietnamese style eggnog . <sssss> egg yolk , sweetened condensed milk , and club soda make for a refreshing and interesting beverage choice . <sssss> come on , go out on a limb and try it !! <sssss> pho ao sen is fantastically delicious and a new favorite of my inner vietnamese woman , ive been missing her greatly of late .
MID		this morning i saw a review for pho avina in the republic . <sssss> . <sssss> well the republic is n't always a reliable source but for me ive been all about the vietnamese fare . <sssss> it just so happens this week i 'm house sitting on the west side so decided to have an early dinner on my way out . <sssss> what 's funny is this place is right on the edge of my old stomping grounds . <sssss> my elementary school is just a few blocks from there . <sssss> . <sssss> of course there were memories of my first kiss . <sssss> . <sssss> my first girlfriend . <sssss> . <sssss> none of which actually took place there but hey memories , cant control 'em . <sssss> i decided that i was going to be hungry for a vietnamese sandwich called bahn mi as well as a bowl of soup , pho . <sssss> got the sammie , the special with pork roll , cilantro , cucumber , jalapeo , pickled carrots and daikon on crusty french bread . <sssss> this was very satisfying . <sssss> . <sssss> while not as great as da vang it held its own . <sssss> i also ordered the vietnamese style beef stew called bun bo ko . <sssss> . <sssss> thick tender chunks of beef in a rich and complex broth served with cilantro , lime , bean sprouts and jalapeo along with vermicelli noodles . <sssss> this was off the hook tasty ! <sssss> the flavors were sweet , savory , slightly spicy and yum-e ! <sssss> the service is very friendly and welcoming . <sssss> the interior wo n't win any design contests but here , its all about the food ! <sssss> they take plastic . <sssss> . <sssss> this is always an important aspect to me as i rarely carry cash . <sssss> .
LOW		i love my macbook pro . <sssss> . <sssss> i love my iphone . <sssss> . <sssss> i love my ipod . <sssss> . <sssss> i love almost everything apple except the stores . <sssss> . <sssss> i 'm sorry but this place isnt much better then best buy . <sssss> . <sssss> a bunch of think-they-know-it-all teenagers running the front of the store . <sssss> hubby washed his iphone and needed to get a replacement . <sssss> . <sssss> seems reasonable right ? <sssss> well some kid in the front was trying to make us an appt through a mac in the front . <sssss> . <sssss> ya know walking back to the genius bar seems to me to be so much easier . <sssss> . <sssss> he finally told us that their were n't any appts left and we would have to come back . <sssss> . <sssss> oh my inner b * tch came out full force , she , i mean he did n't know what hit him . <sssss> . <sssss> we were at the genius bar in moments . <sssss> . <sssss> they replaced the iphone -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- which was very cool but a real hassle getting there in the first place . <sssss> take deep calming breathes when you visit this store .
LOW		okay so maybe they were having second night jitters ? <sssss> perhaps it 's unfair to review a place even though they are n't firing on all cylinders yet ? <sssss> so ill reserve all the complaints of raw shrimp horrible bread and awkward service until i go back and go back i will . <sssss> they make the most tasty duck confit sandwich , served open faced with a duck fat mayo and house made sauerkraut . <sssss> . <sssss> its delicious , heavy and decadent . <sssss> . <sssss> not for the faint of heart or the high of cholesterol . <sssss> . <sssss> i did change the bread out to brioche which was a great choice over rye bread . <sssss> the fries -lrb- they call them pommes frites which they are not -rrb- served with a mayo dipping sauce , were outstanding ! <sssss> pate is one of my favorite french comfort foods and is done very well here . <sssss> however , be certain to ask for different bread . <sssss> . <sssss> i know i said i wouldnt bitch about the bread but i lied . <sssss> . <sssss> it sucks . <sssss> . <sssss> horribly dry , bland and uninteresting . <sssss> i hate to say this but they need to get away from making their own bread and order it from a local bakery . <sssss> epi bread would go awesome with their pate ! <sssss> desserts were alright . <sssss> . <sssss> wished that the crepes were hot , served cold . <sssss> . <sssss> but the beignets were fantastic though round rather than square but it all tastes the same no matter what shape ? <sssss> if they can survive the economy this may turn into a favorite anytime place .
MID		havent been to a brazilian-style steakhouse since in puerto vallarte this past summer . <sssss> while the meat was better in pv the salad bar at fogo is a low carbin ' dream ! <sssss> we 're talking fresh mozzarella , mushrooms , parmigiano-reggiano -lrb- a whole wheel -rrb- , manchego cheese , prosciutto . <sssss> . <sssss> delicious and satisfying all this and more for only 19.50 ! <sssss> now if you want to have endless rounds with the gaucho 's you 'll have to pony up $ 42.50 -lrb- including unlimited salad bar -rrb- , a real bargain if you ask me , great quality . <sssss> the meat just keeps coming and coming . <sssss> . <sssss> highlights were the leg of lamb , garlic beef and the sausage . <sssss> they also bring a basket of bread -lrb- they forgot ours -rrb- as well as fried bananas , mashed potatoes and fried polenta . <sssss> . <sssss> be sure to skip that stuff and stick to the meats and salad bar . <sssss> oh , avoid the pork ribs . <sssss> . <sssss> while the mr liked his , mine tasted like they were in someones ass for a while . <sssss> . <sssss> pretty nast though i think was the bones . <sssss> now if the only the gaucho 's were shirtless or wearing ass less chaps . <sssss> . <sssss> well one would hope .
MID		this here is some good pizza ! <sssss> had the 18 '' stuffed pizza and it was so damn good . <sssss> . <sssss> ate 2 pieces and have a completely full tummy . <sssss> . <sssss> also had some delicious wings and meatballs . <sssss> will certainly go here again . <sssss> . <sssss> great folks running this place too , super friendly !! <sssss> i remember a time where super friendly service was the norm not rarity as it has become . <sssss> kudos to mamma mia !!
MID		simple , satisfying and easy on the wallet , what 's not to love about a well-cooked juicy slab of beef between two freshly baked buns ? <sssss> while some burgers are better than others , there usually is n't much to tell them apart . <sssss> now comes smashburger , the latest and certainly not the last , burger concept that distinguishes itself not by its number of fancy toppings , but by its cooking method . <sssss> smashburger is located in tempe , next to the asu campus , where there is more eye candy than free parking . <sssss> -lrb- there is a parking structure nearby with a $ 3 fee for the first hour . <sssss> -rrb- smashburger 's name pretty much says it all . <sssss> the restaurant takes 100 percent ground angus beef and , using a spatula , literally smashes it onto the cook top . <sssss> the idea is to quickly sear the meat so that the juices are sealed inside the burger . <sssss> i was skeptical of the cooking method since smashing a burger forces juices out during cooking , causing a dry burger . <sssss> but the staff was all smiles , friendly and showing a genuine eagerness to help . <sssss> after only a few bites of my half-pound classic smashburger -lrb- $ 5.99 -rrb- , i was convinced that their cooking method is sound -- it makes for a tasty burger . <sssss> hanging over the edges of the bun , the meat did remain juicy , with that slightly salty beefiness that i know and love . <sssss> if you 're really hungry , you can add another half-pound patty for $ 3 . <sssss> now that 's a burger ! <sssss> smashfries -lrb- $ 1.79 when ordered with a sandwich -rrb- , tossed with olive oil , garlic and rosemary , were an instant hit . <sssss> the haystack onions were limp and too salty . <sssss> chicken sandwiches , salads and hot dogs are also on he menu . <sssss> the arizona devil dog -lrb- $ 3.99 -rrb- is a hebrew national 100 percent beef hot dog slathered with spicy guacamole , habanero cheese , jalapenos and onions on a toasted poppy-seed bun . <sssss> oh , the burn ! <sssss> to cool things off , smashburger makes häagen-dazs milkshakes -lrb- $ 3.99 -rrb- in four flavors -- vanilla , chocolate , strawberry and cactus vanilla -lrb- prickly pear -rrb- . <sssss> the shakes are rich , creamy and decadent . <sssss> being a fast-casual restaurant , customers order at the counter , then find a seat . <sssss> in a short while , someone will bring out your grub . <sssss> the smallish dining space is modern in an accessible chain store kind of way . <sssss> be warned , there are no public restrooms in this store , so be sure to bring your own hand sanitizer . <sssss> so , contrary to popular belief , smashing is actually , well , quite smashing .
HIG		some of the best espresso ive had in a very long time ! <sssss> was so impressed with the quality , the flavor and the staff , press is a complete package ! <sssss> http://twitvid.com/kqmsn
LOW		work is close to cb 's . <sssss> . <sssss> ive driven by this place for yours and have never stopped by . <sssss> okay this place is old school seriously ! <sssss> it 's like you have walked into some time space vacuum where neither exist . <sssss> kitschy , tacky , creepy all describe this place well . <sssss> what they do have are killer sourdough rolls that are chewy and bagel like stacked with plenty of meat too ! <sssss> this place is an awesome cheap eats lunch if ive ever had one ! <sssss> i recommend the 17 '' italian combo so fresh tasting . <sssss> you 'll love it here . <sssss> . <sssss> show up early as the lines can get long !
LOW		i cant attest for the pizza but the salads here are pretty decent . <sssss> i had the zbq salad which was super fresh and tasty ! <sssss> the mr had one of there new rustic pizza 's which he said was pretty good . <sssss> i swear , he needs to start yelping as well ! <sssss> anyhoo . <sssss> . <sssss> very good for a quick lunch . <sssss> . <sssss> plus , they totally carry sweat leaf tea . <sssss> . <sssss> good stuff !!
LOW		i have to say that i 'm am so disappointed with posh at this time . <sssss> the food just failed to wow , that and with an excruciatingly long 2 and a half hour 5 course meal was painful , figuratively and physically -lrb- the seats were so hard -rrb- . <sssss> the idea here to to select what type of eater you are , vegetarian , carnivore , seafood or chefs choice . <sssss> . <sssss> then you outline the things you do n't like as well as dietary restrictions . <sssss> great concept , even now i still think its a great concept but i do n't think many people are going to get it , or are that adventurous . <sssss> i think posh would have done well in a foodie city like san francisco but i do n't think its going to take off here . <sssss> the chef does select great ingredients and seems to be very confident in his knowledge of cooking , plus he 's very creative . <sssss> 2 of us were low carbing of the 4 in our party but , none of the dishes were much different between us . <sssss> for instance they received a portion of kobe beef and we got a lamb chop , we could have just switched plates and it would have been the same effect . <sssss> though when i saw sweet potatoes in the plate i knew that id have to eat around it . <sssss> while the chef ` sent ' his apologies -lrb- he should have come personally -rrb- and offered another savory course , my rear was hurting so bad i passed on it . <sssss> did get a cheese course for dessert which was good but all the fruit around went into the trash , low carb usually means no fruit . <sssss> i 'm sitting here just really disappointed and well , hungry . <sssss> if you 're really hungry order more than 5 courses , if not , well you 'll be looking for something to eat afterward . <sssss> btw , the cookie plate in the end was bigger than any course we had though with being on a low carb diet was kind of torture/cruel since i could n't eat any of them . <sssss> we did leave hungry . <sssss> here 's a list of plates that we had . <sssss> . <sssss> mache salad w/cucumber and blood orange fennel soup with endive salad shrimp with curry and salsify puree sanddab with roast turnip lamb chop with turnip and sweet potato cheese with pickled and fresh fruit
LOW		okay , while i love chris and i love his product i despise their group reservation policy . <sssss> we called weeks ago for a reservation for 9 towards the end of may , they told me that we need to call one month to the date at 5 o'clock . <sssss> . <sssss> so today that call was made at 5 o'clock , the stupid matter of factly bitch told me that the reservations were gone at 4:30 . <sssss> . <sssss> okay , if you 're going to fuck around with the way you do things that 's one thing , but being a dumb bitch about it is completely another . <sssss> i think i 'm finally over my love for this place . <sssss> . <sssss> i mean 3 weeks ago we showed up and was told the wait was 4.5 hours . <sssss> . <sssss> i do n't wait that long for pizza . <sssss> . <sssss> while his pizza is great , its just fucking pizza . <sssss> advice : get a bigger place !! <sssss> sorry but i 'm still fuming mad !!
LOW		i 'm not sure what happened but this place went downhill fast !! <sssss> ordered a pizza last night with sausage , cheese and fresh basil . <sssss> . <sssss> the baked the fucking basil so it turned black and nasty . <sssss> . <sssss> the sausage tasted like it was on the verge of spoiling , very gamy !! <sssss> plus the older woman behind the counter was not pleasant at all . <sssss> . <sssss> where is the old man , i miss his surly service and his killer pies !
LOW		this place is officially off of our rotation and we will never return ! <sssss> we spent a nice weekend in san diego and decided on the way home we would have a mexican lunch . <sssss> well we got here and were sat immediately which is pretty normal . <sssss> . <sssss> then we waited for 10 minutes before we finally asked for some service as we were still sitting without water and chips . <sssss> so the hostess sat us somewwhere else . <sssss> . <sssss> we sat another 5 minutes with no service . <sssss> we got up an left with a vow to never return ! <sssss> by the way this place was filthy , dirty . <sssss> . <sssss> i 'm still pretty upset about this and am hungry as we just came home mad . <sssss> gawd i hate bad service !
MID		comfortably , friendly , inexpensive , delicious , welcoming , spicy , filling , clean , homey , loving , cute , fresh , fast , institution , reliable , familiar , guacamole , beans , sopas , salsa , and flan . <sssss> i love this place !
MID		with so many choices for a good breakfast , it can be kind of hard to stand apart . <sssss> bright , urban , funky and cool scramble is a breath of fresh air to the breakfast scene . <sssss> the concept is great -- order and pay at the counter , then you 're issued a number , take a seat in the dining space , then relax and wait for the food to arrive . <sssss> or choose to sit outdoors on the patio that is also dog-friendly . <sssss> judging by several quotations of egg humor painted along the walls of the restaurant , scramble does n't take itself too seriously . <sssss> but one slogan on the menu hits close to home : `` we 're local and so are our ingredients . '' <sssss> locally sourced ingredients hits high marks when local businesses need our support . <sssss> there are so many tastily described items on the menu that being decisive first thing in the morning is difficult . <sssss> a case filled with cinnamon rolls -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- may help in the decision-making process . <sssss> i 've met many a cinnamon roll , but i 've never encountered one like scramble 's . <sssss> the addition of lemon juice to the frosting distinguishes what would have already been a deliciously tender and gooey roll . <sssss> it took everything in my power not to order a six-pack to go -lrb- $ 16 -rrb- . <sssss> when i scan a menu i try to find the most unique item . <sssss> at scramble , one of those standouts is the brizza -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- . <sssss> the unlikely combination of two words -- breakfast and pizza -- make for a creative selection . <sssss> smoked gouda and cherrywood bacon atop a tender thin crust are well paired , and there was n't a bite left on the plate . <sssss> if the spicy kick of the chorizo with peppers and jalapeno cream cheese version does n't wake you up , then be sure to add a cup of bold bottomless coffee -lrb- $ 2.25 -rrb- . <sssss> french french toast -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- takes thick slices of french baguette , dipped into vanilla custard then cooked on a griddle . <sssss> the slabs of baguette were tender and had a certain creaminess that made dunking into the maple syrup a real winner . <sssss> if you like it savory and sweet , add a side of their cherrywood smoked bacon -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- to the french french toast for some fun with your food . <sssss> bacon dunked into maple syrup is such a childhood pastime . <sssss> scramble also offers lunch after 11 a.m. with a menu of sandwiches , wraps , soups and salads , but breakfast is served all day . <sssss> this is great because i could eat one of those cinnamon rolls anytime !
MID		only open for breakfast and lunch , hero factory caters to the downtown phoenix lunch crowd with humongous , top of the line hero sandwiches . <sssss> with veteran deli owners nicole dorio and jay friedman , quality and freshness are high while the prices are low . <sssss> hero only uses boar 's head meats and cheeses , which you 've probably seen before in the expensive side of the grocery store meat counters . <sssss> this makes all of the difference in quality comparison to the places , left unnamed , who sell $ 5 subs . <sssss> you 'll notice the difference ! <sssss> then there is the bread ! <sssss> covered with toasted sesame seeds , the toothsome bread has a light bagel texture , slightly chewy while remaining tender . <sssss> no wonder since the bread is sourced from our own local chompies bakery . <sssss> when you set foot inside the first thing you 're going to notice is the smell . <sssss> a mixture of onions , meat and tomato sauce fragrances permeate the air inside causing an instant and raging hunger . <sssss> the deli counter is broken up into 3 different areas , each more moth watering then the next . <sssss> the first case is filled with all sorts of delectable salads and desserts . <sssss> then there is the meat and cheese case , where the owners slice the meat to order whether for a sandwich or by the pound . <sssss> then there is the hot section which has steaming hot dishes of deli classics like sausage and peppers and meatballs , the fantastically overwhelming smell was quickly fingered . <sssss> ordering can be a bit tough due to the fact that everything sounds so wonderful . <sssss> signature heroes both cold and hot , wraps , salads and sides make up the large and straight forward menu . <sssss> place your order at the counter , pay , then grab a seat and you 'll be called when its ready . <sssss> once this process is started you can watch as your meat is sliced and your sandwich assembled . <sssss> ive always enjoyed watching my food prepared , you can learn so much for your own kitchen . <sssss> yes , ive already ordered my very own meat slicer so i can do this at home on the weekends when hero is closed . <sssss> the heroes at hero are big , thick and piled heavy with meat , cheese and toppings . <sssss> 2 big eaters can easily share 1 hero sandwich and a side no problem . <sssss> being the big bear that i am i did barely manage to finish one by myself and was quite miserable for sometime after that . <sssss> fortunately parking in downtown phoenix is kind of spread out so a nice walk afterwards will really help out . <sssss> the easiest method would be to park in mid town then take the light rail to the hero factory , it runs right by . <sssss> with so many heroes to chose from i went ahead and put my trust in the owner jay . <sssss> he immediately tells me that his favorite hero is the manhattan -lrb- $ 7.95 -rrb- . <sssss> anything with `` man '' in it has to be good , right ? <sssss> a thick stack of roast beef piled high on toasted garlic bread all covered with melted mozzarella cheese . <sssss> this sandwich was in its most pure form , no veggies and sauces to get in the way , just the simple flavor of good meat , cheese and bread . <sssss> when he came to check on his sandwich i asked for some russian dressing for a bit of a variation , this single element added that extra dimension that turned the manhattan from good to great ! <sssss> their russian dressing is some of the best i 've had . <sssss> they really should bottle and sell this dressing , ca n't wait to try it on a salad ! <sssss> of course the owner is going to know what 's best to eat off of his menu . <sssss> it was great that he did n't say the generic phrase , `` everything is good on the menu '' . <sssss> taking matters in my own hands , next up was the crackerjack -lrb- $ 7.95 -rrb- . <sssss> while not as anti-holiday as i was looking for this one was simply fantastic ! <sssss> thin sliced cracked pepper turkey , oozy melted pepper jack cheese then dressed with lettuce , tomatoes , onions and their amazing russian dressing . <sssss> each bite of the spicy turkey and cheese was a hard contrast to the sweet flavors of the holiday ; this one definitely has some heat to it . <sssss> if something all american is more your liking , then the patriot -lrb- $ 7.95 -rrb- will be a home run ! <sssss> roast beef , turkey , ham and american cheese topped with lettuce , tomato and onion . <sssss> you can never go wrong with the basics at hero . <sssss> what 's a deli without trying some of the home made salads ? <sssss> the cheese and bacon tortellini salad -lrb- $ 1.75 1/2lb -rrb- was so creamy , smoky and tender , one taste was not enough . <sssss> in fact this one was so good i did n't want to share with my table mates . <sssss> the deli case also had a tomato and mozzarella salad -lrb- $ 1.75 1/2lb -rrb- that was perfectly dressed with balsamic vinegar and olive oil . <sssss> each cherry tomato exploded with sweet tangy flavor contrasted by the balsamic coated mozzarella , delightful . <sssss> the hours at hero are limited to weekday mornings and afternoons which may be the only drawback to his location . <sssss> since the light rail is moving finally and more businesses are opening downtown , perhaps the hours will include a saturday ? <sssss> i sure hope so , i really love this place !
HIG		omg ! <sssss> i cant believe i waited this long to go here ! <sssss> i was thinking it was going to be just some little store . <sssss> . <sssss> this place is huge , well for a spice store . <sssss> they are well focused and of great quality ! <sssss> the staff is so friendly and helpful . <sssss> . <sssss> i did get to bash them both as neither had tried the buttermilk ranch mix ! <sssss> they were closing for the night so i did n't get a chance to thoroughly scour every inch of this great store but what i did get , amazing ! <sssss> try the smoked paprika , oh yeah ! <sssss> oh they also had french lavender . <sssss> . <sssss> i see a cheesecake in my future . <sssss> . <sssss> now if i could only convince the mr to make it for me ! <sssss> he is a pastry chef after all !
MID		upfront . <sssss> . <sssss> the owners of sweet republic are good friends of me and the mr. . <sssss> so its that awkward position that i did n't really think about until now . <sssss> to yelp or not to yelp , that is the question . <sssss> the thing is you feel you want to give their business 5 stars but perhaps risk your yelp integrity because they are friends of yours . <sssss> the cool thing is that they are both yelpers as well so they understand !! <sssss> let me tell you . <sssss> . <sssss> sweet republic is not a chain . <sssss> . <sssss> its local , natural and delicious . <sssss> last night the mr and i were so in the mood for ice cream we surprised our friends by just showing up . <sssss> we had n't been in the space since it was still under construction but let me say that the store turned out great ! <sssss> a tight and bright modern comfort feeling comes over you as soon as you walk in the door . <sssss> in fact bizzare love triangle was playing as we walked in . <sssss> . <sssss> i used to love that song ! <sssss> we immediately were greeted by 2 beautiful smiling faces . <sssss> . <sssss> so add warm to the store as well ! <sssss> be sure to look down . <sssss> . <sssss> the concrete floors are striking ! <sssss> immediately me and the mr got our game on . <sssss> . <sssss> sr offers several varieties of sorbet , ice cream and a small assortment of baked goods . <sssss> . <sssss> all made on premises ! <sssss> -lrb- love locals ! <sssss> -rrb- we started with tastings of lime and basil sorbet , followed by pear and ginger then coconut . <sssss> . <sssss> the coconut sorbet was some of the best ive tried . <sssss> . <sssss> in fact it was the only ive ever tried . <sssss> rich and creamy for sorbet with pieces of shredded coconut . <sssss> . <sssss> just wonderful ! <sssss> we moved onto ice cream . <sssss> . <sssss> me and the mr can be quite gluttonous when something is good . <sssss> . <sssss> i think we sampled most of the flavors of ice cream but the shining star was the salted carmel !! <sssss> seriously good stuff here ! <sssss> you know how some people can compare certain foods with sexual experiences . <sssss> . <sssss> this for me was one of them . <sssss> . <sssss> creamy , rich , sweet , slightly salty , chewy goodness ! <sssss> if you have anything have this one . <sssss> . <sssss> i know it 'll be a claim to fame as it 's done so well ! <sssss> sr also makes frozen yogurt . <sssss> not the super sweet , super tangy variety you find at the pinkberry clones but a subtly flavored low sweetness froyo . <sssss> they even make their own yogurt . <sssss> . <sssss> we 're talking ground up here kids . <sssss> . <sssss> no corners cut ! <sssss> they offer a variety of toppings both for the frozen yogurt and the ice cream . <sssss> . <sssss> though because they are as natural as possible you wont find neon colored kid cereal but healthy granola , fruits and sauces . <sssss> this makes them truly different since they are doing exactly what they believe in . <sssss> let 's not forget the small assortment of baked goods . <sssss> . <sssss> we only tried the meringues . <sssss> . <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> the cookies and banana bread looked awesome . <sssss> . <sssss> next time ! <sssss> in the cold case they also have some pints prepacked as well as a few house made frozen novelties . <sssss> the brownie cookie ice cream sandwich will be the next thing i try !! <sssss> if you like wholesome , natural and yummy this will be a great place to spend some time . <sssss> they even have free wifi so you can ` chill ' for a while ! <sssss> i hope i did them justice without being overly gushy as well as loyal to my yelp integrity .
LOW		over priced . <sssss> . <sssss> over seasoned . <sssss> . <sssss> slow service . <sssss> that about sums quiessence up . <sssss> while the grounds are sort of romantic -lrb- think plant nursery meets your mom 's backyard -rrb- its not charming enough to make up for the boring menu . <sssss> while i can appreciate where they are coming from , `` slow '' food does not mean that you have to wait for the food to grow while you sit there at the dining table .
LOW		as i 'm sitting here this morning casting my zagat votes i cant help but feel underwhelmed by the selections on their `` arizona 's top restaurants '' i cant help but wonder why some of these places are on here . <sssss> is barrio cafe really the best of ? <sssss> for me , i think not . <sssss> we went with about 6 friends so we were able to try many things on the menu . <sssss> however nothing even remotely stood out . <sssss> oh yes something did , the loud dining room . <sssss> it was so loud we were literally shouting at one another from across the table . <sssss> i love to talk over dinner so my throat was pretty hoarse afterwards . <sssss> . <sssss> ah yes , the waiter was a very nice looking man and was super flirty with all of us . <sssss> . <sssss> he got a big tip . <sssss> otherwise i scratch my head and wonder why so many people gush over this place ? <sssss> its not bad , its just blah .
MID		it was by sheer chance that we ended up going to radio milano . <sssss> at the corner of 40th street and campbell there are 3 different restaurants to chose from , the famed lgo market and pizzeria , postino wine cafe and of course radio milano . <sssss> we had every intention of eating at postino wine cafe , but after we were told it was going to be an hour wait , our grumbling tummies knew were n't about to wait that long . <sssss> looking across the street at radio milano we scouted ahead to see what they wait was like over there , what luck , we were sat immediately ! <sssss> opened in june 2007 by the same folks who own lgo pizzeria and postino , lgo hospitality , its quite the neighborhood dining destination . <sssss> the only problem here is the lack of parking , though with complimentary valet service this should n't be much of a issue . <sssss> the space has a laid back eclectic kind of vibe , barrel ceilings , lots of wood and brick and a funky soundtrack playing in the background , which provided a decent thump without being overbearing . <sssss> pretty much any where you sit the you 'll have a view of the open kitchen , which im a huge fan of . <sssss> something about watching the chefs making my meal just gives a place more of a homey kind of groove . <sssss> i 'm not sure how they did it , but the staff at radio milano is not only super attractive but friendly and extremely helpful . <sssss> radio is know for their great cocktails , but not one person in our dining party ordered one as we stuck with glass after glass of peroni -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , a deliciously light italian beer . <sssss> as you might be able to deduce , the food at radio milano is definitely inspired italian with hints of moms kitchen . <sssss> that mix might sound kind of odd but is most apparent in the starters and salads section of the menu . <sssss> the appetizers are large enough to share starting with toni 's deviled eggs -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> my mama makes a mean deviled egg so when someone decided to make one , the bar is set extremely high . <sssss> shhh , they add bacon to the top of theirs which trumps my mothers creamy delights , it 's everything a deviled egg should be and more . <sssss> shattered potato chips -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- are made to order and like most parties , whats a party without chips and dip ? <sssss> served with a creamy mayo and tomato sauce dip , these spuds were crispy along the edges and tender in the middle , these were woofed down in time flat . <sssss> another standout were the crispy bites of the celery ceasar -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- which had us all cleaning the plate . <sssss> the perfectly dressed crunch of the celery was a nice contrast to the creamy shavings of parmesan cheese . <sssss> the tuna crudo -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- is an ample mound of fresh raw tuna dressed with a light citrus vinaigrette and served with shattered potato chips . <sssss> i could have easily ordered another one for my dinner , very well balanced . <sssss> main courses include pasta , fish and meat with a surprise or two thrown in , one of those surprises was the lobster roll -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- . <sssss> a huge serving of tender lobster salad was spooned inside of a grilled buttery roll then served with shattered potato chips was amazing . <sssss> each bite beckoned for another and another though resist and enjoy each and every one . <sssss> house made papardelle -lrb- $ 17 -rrb- incorporated hand made ribbon pasta , sweet corn , tomatoes , seasonal veggies and goat cheese . <sssss> fortunately every table is equipped with salt and pepper grinders since notably the dish was under seasoned . <sssss> a quick turn of the grinder brought out the sweet freshness of the vegetables . <sssss> aqua pazza -lrb- $ 23 -rrb- is a fish offering which rotates frequently . <sssss> this particular visit , the selection were 4 plump scallops served with sauteed spinach and roasted cherry tomatoes . <sssss> while the scallops were decent they were swimming in an oily sauce . <sssss> i think with the addition of an absorbant like potatoes , these would have improved from decent to great . <sssss> with only a few offerings dolce or desserts were all that and more . <sssss> you can order a scoop or scoops of different flavors of gelato which are made by the neighboring grateful spoon gelato -lrb- $ 3 - $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> or go into a wonderfully sugar induced coma brought on my the radio chocolate pudding -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- . <sssss> served in a massive glass complete with whipped cream , i 'm not sure how you could eat here and not order this as waves of comfort wash over you with each and every spoonful . <sssss> the citrus spiked olive oil cake -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- had a super moist crumb and finished with the delightful taste of olive oil . <sssss> radio milano may have been chosen by chance and circumstance but i assure you , when they re-open , future visits will definitely be on purpose .
LOW		i 've often used the word chinamerican to help describe food being made at some chinese restaurants . <sssss> this type americanized chinese cookery usually includes the same suspects like sweet and sour chicken , fried rice , lo mein and can be found pretty much anywhere except old town scottsdale . <sssss> now the owners of geisha a go go and stingray sushi have opened another asian concept capturing the essence of chinamerican , jimmy woo 's . <sssss> while cool and modern inside , they somehow managed to pay homage to the type of chinese restaurants i knew when i was a kid . <sssss> there are no white and pink table cloths here but the half moon shaped black leather booths , dim lighting and old school chinese menu evokes a 70 's mod vibe . <sssss> be sure to check out the enormous abacus , it 'll be the largest you 'll ever see . <sssss> outdoors , woo 's has a fantastic patio that faces scottsdale road which is great for people watching . <sssss> woo 's offers a daily happy hour that starts at 3pm , which gets you drink discounts and a well priced small plates menu . <sssss> offerings such as plump and juicy pan fried pork dumplings -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- and a plate full of fork tender , lightly fried salt and pepper calamari -lrb- $ 5.25 -rrb- are stand outs . <sssss> if you pair these with a carafe of hot sake -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- , happy hour could be a meal in of itself . <sssss> looking over you 'll notice that it 's all about the classics and these classics are done pretty well , starting with hot and sour soup -lrb- $ 5.95 -rrb- . <sssss> yes this is on every single chinese menu around town but woo 's version adds tofu , mushrooms , egg , bamboo and chicken making for a hearty robust soup . <sssss> be sure to ask for some chili paste , the nose clearing effect is like tasty medicine . <sssss> after one bite of the chinese chicken salad -lrb- $ 8.95 -rrb- , you could n't help but notice that while well dressed in a peanut ginger dressing , it lacked any sort of flavor punch . <sssss> made with napa cabbage , carrot , bell pepper , snap peas and scallions then topped with fried noodles and almonds , the ingredients were vibrant and fresh . <sssss> hopefully they reconfigure their dressing since the added brightness from citrus juice or vinegar can be key to taking ho-hum to wow . <sssss> slightly crispy , tender , sweet and sour tossed with bits of chili and citrus peel , the orange beef -lrb- $ 13.95 -rrb- was decent . <sssss> for me this is what asian style cooking is all about , appealing to many of my senses without any one being overwhelmed . <sssss> however on another visit this dish was so overly sweetened and gloopy that it was pretty much inedible . <sssss> different chef ? <sssss> i thought it was funny the veggie only , eggplant with tofu and mushroom -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- dish was one of the most expensive on the menu . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , this dish was tasty with its slightly sweet sauce and well cooked vegetables it 's just priced oddly high . <sssss> i found it funny that many of the shrimp and scallop dishes are priced less than this one . <sssss> go figure . <sssss> jimmy woo 's may woo you with its sophisticated yet fun atmosphere , but for me it was the friendly service and their ability to make chinese hip and cool . <sssss> i only wish the food was as hip and cool .

HIG		so low carbin ' is all ive been talking about lately and im working on creating a new list with my recommendations . <sssss> it might seem like a taco/torta shop is the last place you can low carb but los reyes is exceptional , especially on the cheap ! <sssss> order the tacos alambre de res -lrb- $ 4.75 -rrb- and have them hold the tortillas . <sssss> . <sssss> so what you get is a plate full of chopped beef , onions , bacon all covered in melted cheese served with shredded cabbage , sliced radishes , sliced cucumbers , grilled onion and a grilled jalapeno . <sssss> slather on some salsa and do n't eat the grilled onion and you 've got yourself some good eating right there !

HIG		i 've never written about him before , i have a gay father . <sssss> well , technically he 's not my real father but a man who i met some years ago . <sssss> coming out for me was pretty tough , married , house in the suburbs and a wife who i loved deeply . <sssss> after coming out to her , my family and friends , my therapist suggested i quickly join an online support group for married gay men , and that 's where i met larry johnson . <sssss> a kind older man , larry immediately took me under his wing ; living in san francisco it was easy for him to show me more about our mutual passion , food . <sssss> over the years we 've exchanged thousands of emails and i 've visited him in sf as often as i could , larry taught me a great deal about fine dining . <sssss> including how to have food adventures and about getting the most out of life 's pleasures . <sssss> while my mom will always be my first food hero , larry will always be my gay dad and has helped to make me who i am today . <sssss> so when he comes into town for a visit i 'm always a little stressed out about where to take him for dinner . <sssss> this visit was easy , i decided to choose something basic and straight forward like steak . <sssss> opened 60 years ago , durant 's is not only a phoenix institution but is also a great steakhouse . <sssss> while the trend of new steakhouses in the valley has finally started to taper off , durant 's classic approach is commendable and endearing . <sssss> i 'm talking about fantastically tender steak , understandable sides and professional service . <sssss> steakhouses in general are probably some of the most expensive restaurants in town . <sssss> so i was ready to spend a mint on dinner but did notice one thing at durant 's , the steaks are n't ala carte . <sssss> this means when you order a steak you 're not only getting soup or salad but you 're also getting your choice of accompaniment , what a value . <sssss> entering durant 's from the rear will take you right through the kitchen , dont worry about this , its all part of the charm . <sssss> you 'll see that the kitchen is spotless and most of the cooks turn around and give you a warm smile and a happy hello . <sssss> once you get into the dining room its all old school . <sssss> black leather booths , crushed red velour wallpaper and dim lighting all set the mood for a relaxed and subdued dinner experience . <sssss> ordering the 16 oz ribeye steak -lrb- $ 39.50 -rrb- was an easy choice for most steak lovers . <sssss> the ribeye for has the perfect amount of marbling to meat ratio , this means that the meat will be really flavorful without being too fatty . <sssss> i have to tell you , the ribeye at durant 's was one of the best steaks i 've had in years . <sssss> this thick juicy steak was everything that a steak should be , slightly salty with a distinct smoky char and perfectly tender . <sssss> i also upgraded my side to the stuffed baked potato -lrb- $ 4.95 -rrb- , think twice baked potato . <sssss> larry 's 8oz new york strip -lrb- $ 29.50 -rrb- and loaded baked potato were delivered . <sssss> not only was the steak perfectly seasoned , it was expertly cooked at medium-rare as requested . <sssss> a silence fell over the table as we enjoyed our meals together . <sssss> durant 's not only impressed me and me made look good , but they made me proud of our restaurant heritage here in phoenix . <sssss> durant 's , thank you .
MID		back in the day when the tart frozen yogurt craze started with the wildly popular pinkberry , who knew that would lead to literally hundreds of knock offs . <sssss> yes , even pinkberry is a knock off of the korean chain red mango , which is probably a knock off of another . <sssss> but it was pinkberry 's simple healthy approach , stylish interiors and lines out the door which drew much attention to itself and its concept . <sssss> so it was only a matter of time before someone would copy the success , some almost as good and others well , not so much . <sssss> yogurtland is one of those success stories , expanding to nearly 50 locations nationwide in only a few years . <sssss> while it 's not pinkberry , their claim to fame is to offer more for less . <sssss> choose your size of cup then fill it with one of the many varieties of the low calorie , low sugar , non-fat fro-yo . <sssss> then pile high the toppings ranging from fresh fruit , breakfast cereal , cookies , syrups and candy , be as stingy are as creative as you like . <sssss> once your satisfied with your creation , set it on the scale for your total . <sssss> yogurtland charges a mere $ .30 an ounce so you can become quite the fro-yo artist with little investment to your imagination . <sssss> once it was my turn to approach the self service machines i was immediately overwhelmed by the choices . <sssss> finally i got a hold of myself and made a fro-yo base of vanilla wafer cookies and cream , new york cheesecake and plain tart . <sssss> though the best was yet to come , the topping station ! <sssss> bananas , vanilla wafers , fruity pebbles and chewy rainbow mochi , i was set and at $ 3.60 i felt like i somehow robbed them . <sssss> being mostly a purist i immediately tapped the fruity pebble and banana adorned plain tart . <sssss> for tart yogurt its bite was subtle , each bite was as delightful as the first . <sssss> the vanilla wafer cookies and cream had an artificial vanilla taste which wasnt very good . <sssss> however eating the new york cheesecake flavor was creamy and well rounded . <sssss> the addition of the vanilla wafers was a hit and meshed really well with the smooth cheesecake taste . <sssss> yogurtland is pretty hopping most nights , so take a dose of patients and imagine the endless choices that will be bestowed upon you once you reach the front of the line .
LOW		opened in 1970 , la piñata , a family affair , has been dishing up sonora style mexican food for 39 years . <sssss> walking into the restaurant you 're immediately transported back to 1970 . <sssss> no time machine required , thanks to dark orange vinyl booths , plastic wood laminate tables and stucco walls . <sssss> the only element missing were the traditional mexican dresses . <sssss> though it something feels like it was n't that long ago when those may have been retired . <sssss> even in the 70 's style , la piñata is relaxed , like going to a friend 's house for dinner . <sssss> the dark orange vinyl might be original but you can tell this place is loved and well cared for . <sssss> not a strip of duct tape anywhere ! <sssss> starting with chips and salsa is almost always pure happiness . <sssss> hot and crispy , slightly salty paired with thick chunky salsa , a real bargain at free . <sssss> be warned if you think thick and chunky means mild and bland , far from it . <sssss> on first bite the fresh tomato flavor bursts into your mouth followed quickly by a smack of the spicy chili heat . <sssss> the 2 contrasts work so well together that it 's quite difficult to stop eating until the bowl is empty . <sssss> cleverly hidden in the back as to make it more special , is another salsa , this one being almost as spicy and slightly sweet . <sssss> many mexican restaurants have a spicier salsa they keep in back and will only bring out if requested . <sssss> ask for this one and your server will happily bring you out a dish . <sssss> for lunch la piñata offers a variety of specials . <sssss> there 's a taco in my burro -lrb- $ 4.95 -rrb- that uses a large flour tortilla , filling it up with ground beef , lettuce , tomatoes , cheese and onions . <sssss> try getting your mouth around this one ! <sssss> letter f -lrb- $ 8.95 -rrb- combines a taco of your choice and a cheese enchilada served with rice and beans . <sssss> the shredded beef taco was decent but it was the cheese enchilada that rocked this plate . <sssss> the sauce was so wonderfully creamy you could n't tell where the sauce ended and the melted cheese began . <sssss> a dozen of these would n't be enough ! <sssss> a , taco salad -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- could be considered a lighter option if the deliciously crunchy shell was missing . <sssss> who wants to give up that texture for a few hundred calories ? <sssss> choice of chicken or beef and topped by large dollops of guacamole and sour cream , pure caloric heaven ! <sssss> aside from the luncheon menu the remainder can be ordered all day . <sssss> being a great place to start , the mary lou -lrb- $ 8.75 -rrb- , may sound like a retired olympic gymnast , is actually red or green chile with meat , folded into a humongous cheese crisp served with a cruet full of sour cream . <sssss> the red chile has a certain creaminess that 's further contrasted with thick tender cubes of beef and a spoonful of sour cream , so easy to swallow . <sssss> piñata appetizers -lrb- $ 12.50 -rrb- comes on a large dinner plate literally filled with miniature tacos , chimichangas , flautas , green corn tamale and a bowl of refried beans for dipping . <sssss> this is the mother lode of appetizers , easily feeding 2-4 diners or for a larger appetite ordered as a main course . <sssss> being able to try so many different items at one time make this the dim sum of mexican food . <sssss> as you can tell the portion sizes at la piñata are extremely generous . <sssss> the tio pancho 's pollo con queso -lrb- $ 11.95 -rrb- is an entree force to be reckoned with . <sssss> a deep fried burro stuffed with tender seasoned chicken and smothered in melted jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar cheese . <sssss> easily mesmerized by its girth , one bite and you 'll know why you ordered it , simply fantastic . <sssss> the yucatan -lrb- $ 11.95 -rrb- is similar in its approach though this time you 're given the choice of meats chicken or beef . <sssss> once again smothered , this time in their spinach con queso sauce that combines cheese and spinach into each cheesy melty bite , napkins required . <sssss> there are also 10 combination plates for the diner who enjoys variety . <sssss> the number 2 -lrb- $ 10.95 -rrb- comes with 2 red or green cheese enchiladas with rice and beans . <sssss> again the enchiladas here are simply top drawer . <sssss> refried beans are generally the norm , but there is nothing normal about how good these taste . <sssss> these refried beans could easily make up a meal on their own with a bowl of chips and salsa . <sssss> or you can wrap your fist around a bean burrito -lrb- $ 4.25 -rrb- and savor each creamy smooth mouthful . <sssss> with so much savory and spicy it 's nice to know that there are desserts to refresh your palate . <sssss> the house made flan -lrb- $ 4.25 -rrb- is a great way to finish your meal . <sssss> it is n't possible but the caramel sauce served with the flan would make an excellent dessert soup . <sssss> lightly syrupy with a rich buttery taste , if they do start serving bowl of it , you read it first here ! <sssss> sopapilla with honey -lrb- $ 2.95 -rrb- is always a sticky and sweet pleaser . <sssss> lightly fried and delicately crisp on the outside , steamy chewiness on the inside all slathered with thick ropes of golden honey , it is n't just dessert but a simple pleasure . <sssss> we are blessed to have one another in our busy day to day lives . <sssss> so it 's nice to know that there are such welcoming places , like la piñata , where we can tear tortillas , eat homemade beans and just enjoy and celebrate .
HIG		3 years ago chef johnny chu set out to bring a hot pot restaurant to the valley of the sun . <sssss> if you 're unfamiliar with chef chu he 's the proprietor of the hip and popular downtown phoenix asian tapas joint sens. now his dream is realized with the opening of tien wong hot pot . <sssss> surprisingly his new restaurant is n't even located in downtown phoenix , but in the city of chandler . <sssss> after talking with chef chu on my last visit he explained to me that this location was selected to prove out his concept , in an asian neighborhood . <sssss> low rent and a discerning customer base , he can make all the necessary tweaks for success and will hopefully bring tien wong to downtown in the future . <sssss> for many the whole hot pot experience might be foreign since many of us are used to having our food cooked for us , forget that . <sssss> the idea of hot pot while romantic and interactive , is all about you cooking various meats and vegetables in hot pots filled with flavored broths . <sssss> each table is equipped with a high powered induction burner where you hot pot is placed , and then you order as many different raw meats , seafood , vegetables and noodles as you desire . <sssss> once our order started showing up i become overwhelmed and confused , where do you start ? <sssss> what are the cooking times ? <sssss> what do i do ? <sssss> before allowing my head to explode , i simply took a breather and one of the helpful staff to my aid . <sssss> in my calamity i did n't notice the helpful hints on the welcome card . <sssss> however it goes something like this , the broth boils , you drop in the thinly sliced meats , pull out , dip into one of 2 sauces , sesame and soy , then eat , easy . <sssss> after only a few minutes of practice it all came together into a well crafted experience that 's designed for socializing , romance and lingering . <sssss> if you have difficulty choosing your broth , opt for the ying yang broth -lrb- $ 5.95 -rrb- which includes both the house original herbal broth and the house spicy broth with the later being the most complex of the flavors i 've tried . <sssss> starting with pork stock , the addition of dried dates , ginseng , schezuan peppercorns and dried chiles give the base heat and depth . <sssss> over the course of your evening the broth evaporates with cooking which adds to the intensity and enjoyment . <sssss> not to be confused with the tips of peas , pea tips -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- actually are the leaves and stems surrounding the pea itself . <sssss> the tips cook fast and have both crunchy and tender qualities that taste so good either cooked or raw . <sssss> by contrast the korean pumpkin -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- takes longer to cook but the payoff is so tender you can even eat the thin skin . <sssss> noodles include springy udon -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- as well as a flat rice noodle -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- which resemble chewy flat pieces of rice than a noodle in the traditional sense . <sssss> both cook up in a hurry and their absorbent properties are capable for taking in so much flavor . <sssss> sliced wagyu beef -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- comes from one of the best breeds of cattle in the world . <sssss> so its no surprise that the meat was flavorful and tender . <sssss> add an order of lobster -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- , if available , for a surf and turf combo . <sssss> names are n't always accurate descriptions , take sliced black pork -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- which is n't black at all , the name refers to the pigs breed since it has black hair and skin . <sssss> it 's super tender and flavorful only taking a few seconds to cook thanks to expert slicing . <sssss> desserts feature 2 different kind of cheesecake , strawberry -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- and green tea -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- , both were light and satisfying , the perfect ending to chef chu 's dream .
MID		okay . <sssss> . <sssss> so i 'm one of those people who loves taking a chance and trying grand openings . <sssss> humble pie is one of this places ive been waiting for since i read about it a year and a half ago . <sssss> so today was their first public opening so with a spray of cologne and some plastic we were on our way ! <sssss> let me tell you up front , this place is going to be packed for a while . <sssss> we arrive around 6:30 pm and not a table to be had so we opted to sit at the bar . <sssss> we had a pretty good vantage of the whole place . <sssss> . <sssss> from the warming boxes at the front to the wine cellar on the far part of the restaurant -lrb- i want one of those ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the space looks like it 's not quite finished but you can tell and feel that the space is going to be very comfortable . <sssss> to start they offer wine flights , oh yeah honey . <sssss> . <sssss> thats what i 'm talking about ! <sssss> nothing like a nice heady wine buzz to get things started . <sssss> pouring over the menu was pretty easy . <sssss> . <sssss> there are a handful of apps , salads and pizza 's . <sssss> i started with the grilled steak salad . <sssss> . <sssss> this salad is very good though the addition of some cheese would sent it over the top ! <sssss> we also ordered the humble caprese . <sssss> . <sssss> you know when your toes start to curl when you 're about to uh , uhm . <sssss> . <sssss> well , ya know . <sssss> . <sssss> its sort of like that ! <sssss> super creamy mozzarella , roasted cherry tomatoes on the vine . <sssss> . <sssss> it does n't get much better , simple , clean and flavorful . <sssss> pizza 's . <sssss> . <sssss> schreiners sicilian sausage with roasted fennel . <sssss> . <sssss> wild mushrooms and pancetta . <sssss> . <sssss> to start the crust . <sssss> . <sssss> light , slightly crisp , chewy , slightly salty in a good way . <sssss> . <sssss> for me , the crust here was nothing short of perfect . <sssss> . <sssss> it held the ample toppings nicely and of a nice chew and balance with the flavors of the topping . <sssss> sausage and fennel was great plus nothing like sourcing locally ! <sssss> the mushroom and pancetta was a nice balance of earthy mushroom varieties and crispy salty pancetta . <sssss> the mozzerella on the pizza 's was the same heavenly pillow used on the caprese . <sssss> . <sssss> beware , addictive ! <sssss> we also received a mistake pizza of pepperoni pizza . <sssss> . <sssss> apparently we were in the right place at the right time since the guy next to us liked his mistake pizza -lrb- no sauce -rrb- so we were happy to take it off the waiters hands ! <sssss> i 'm not a fan of pepperoni , usually it 's greasy limp and fatty . <sssss> the pepperoni was crisp and well , i could eat one of these for breakfast ! <sssss> i 'm glad that kitchen had a few kinks to work out , this was a great mistake . <sssss> on to the desserts . <sssss> . <sssss> we tried the olive oil gelato as well as the fresh berry crostada . <sssss> having had olive oil gelato at a place in la called mozza i was hoping that humble 's version would be better . <sssss> it did n't disappoint ! <sssss> a very light taste of good olive oil surrounded in a creamy well textured gelato . <sssss> . <sssss> i would order this one over and over again ! <sssss> the crustada was well done and since berries are in season this made for a nice treat . <sssss> so me and the mister very much liked this place and want to fall in love . <sssss> . <sssss> so right now we are in the infatuation period . <sssss> . <sssss> we went ahead and made a reservation for tomorrow night . <sssss> . <sssss> i have plans on chowing down a shrimp , barrata pizza and or course , that marvelous pepperoni .

HIG		this latest hybrid might sound different but after trying the filipino-mexican fusion at karey 's kitchen , you 'll ask yourself why no one had done it sooner ? <sssss> situated at the southeast corner behind blockbuster at 40th street and thomas road , karey 's is in one of those blink-and-miss-it locations . <sssss> from the good luck kitty at the register to the rich looking hardwood floors and dark wood furniture , it 's actually charming . <sssss> there are a few tables as well as counter seating for eat in , and the tables can be pushed together to accommodate a party of eight or more . <sssss> karen , once an accountant , has turned restaurateur in this family-run venture , which includes her mom , puring , husband , ray , and brother , michael . <sssss> it brings me so much joy to see the love and care that goes into a place that is family owned and independent . <sssss> the warm smiling faces that greet you at the counter are so genuine and welcoming . <sssss> karen and puring run the front of the store and tail it back to the kitchen to cook . <sssss> for the unfamiliar , many filipino foods consist of stews , braises and roasts of beef , pork and chicken , which work perfectly for this concept . <sssss> for the purist you can order a combination plate of classic filipino dishes and select your own items , or you can go for something more unconventional , yet accessible , like many of its tasty hybrid burritos , chimichangas and flautas . <sssss> i must add the menu is more of a guideline rather than something set in stone . <sssss> if there is something on the menu you find yourself craving , maybe call ahead to make sure she has it that day . <sssss> sourcing top quality has been tough , and on a several visits the restaurant was out of one thing or another . <sssss> daily specials play a large part of karey 's menu , and there are always three to five specials per day . <sssss> if you 'd like to know about those dishes , you can choose to follow karey 's kitchen on twitter . <sssss> on one visit i created my own three-item combo -lrb- $ 5.99 -rrb- , which included a couple of out-of-this-world pork spare ribs . <sssss> the barbecue sauce was house-made and had a wonderful slightly smoky and sweet flavor . <sssss> i also chose the chicken curry , which was fall-off , the bone tender and not heavy like most i 've tried . <sssss> to round off the combo , i chose the pancit , which is the filipino version of chinese lo mein . <sssss> though rice sticks were used instead of egg noodles , it has a lighter sauce . <sssss> of course this was made to order and the vegetables were still slightly crisp . <sssss> the pancit is probably the lightest item on the menu and had plenty of chicken breast and vegetables for those who are watching their figures . <sssss> adobo is to the philippines as pho is to vietnam . <sssss> essentially a method of stewing meat brought to the philipines by the spanish in the 1500s , it has become the national dish . <sssss> karey 's version is absolutely delicious with its rich savory flavors and tender meats . <sssss> you can have this in a combo or rice bowl , but do yourself a favor and get the pork adobo burrito -lrb- $ 5.99 -rrb- . <sssss> a huge flour tortilla stuffed with pork adobo then rolled in parmesan cheese . <sssss> with the outside rolled in cheese , it adds a depth to the burrito that i 've never quite experienced . <sssss> with the burrito you also have your choice of spanish rice , white rice , garlic rice or beans . <sssss> the spanish and garlic rice are moist and flavorful , but my favorite were the creamy beans . <sssss> karey 's does n't have a traditional mexican salsa but instead chooses to use asian chili paste . <sssss> the spicy vinegary heat is the perfect complement to every dish i tried . <sssss> i love eggrolls in about any shape and form , including karey 's outstanding filipino version called lumpia -lrb- $ 2.95 / $ 4.95 -rrb- . <sssss> these are smaller than what you 'd normally expect at an asian restaurant , but the crunch factor is far bigger . <sssss> simply filled with seasoned ground pork and served with a side of sweet chili sauce , these little bad boys are fantastically crispy and light . <sssss> keeping with the hybrid fusion theme , desserts are few but interesting and worth the calories . <sssss> the halo halo -lrb- $ 4.95 -rrb- is made of shaved ice , beans , purple yams , sweetened condensed milk and ice cream . <sssss> okay , i know , it sounds a little crazy , and when it is served , the first thing that comes up is , `` what have i gotten myself into ? '' <sssss> this dessert is brightly colored and unusual in its presentation with so many different layers . <sssss> once you brave the first bite , it wo n't be your last . <sssss> creamy , icy , tender and smooth , it 's a textural and flavor overload that should be experienced at least once . <sssss> i have a feeling i 'll be having another one on my next visit . <sssss> ask about puring 's cassava cake -lrb- $ 1.29 -rrb- . <sssss> it 's served warm and is made from shredded cassava , coconut milk and sugar . <sssss> from the crispy lumpia to the tender , melt-in-your-mouth adobo , karen and company cooks how they want to eat and treat their customers how they want to be treated , like family .
MID		so the salsa has way to much black pepper . <sssss> . <sssss> the service is n't always friendly . <sssss> . <sssss> but the list of tequila 's is tdf ! <sssss> i generally frequent this place for a cheap yummy lunch , green chile navajo taco , and is super close to work . <sssss> . <sssss> nothing like tying one on at lunch time to make the rest of the afternoon smooth by . <sssss> . <sssss> just kidding , i never do that !
LOW		there 's an unexplainable culinary phenomenon that 's probably happened to each and every one of us , a sandwich for whatever reason always tastes better when someone else makes it . <sssss> i 'm not sure how or why this happens . <sssss> if you ask around many have already formulated a various theories . <sssss> some feel it 's the way the condiments are layered amongst the slices of meat and cheese . <sssss> others think that it 's a secret ingredient that maker uses like a dash of celery salt or paprika . <sssss> my mom used to make me a sandwich of sliced turkey , muenster cheese , miracle whip , bread and butter pickles on wonder bread . <sssss> i 've made this sandwich so many times but have never been able to make it taste as good as hers . <sssss> i recently tested this out at breadcrafters bakery and cafe in paradise valley where they specialize in fresh bakes breads , house made salads and of course sandwiches made by someone else . <sssss> breadcrafters is n't your ordinary sandwich shop , as the name indicates they also bake bread and pastries , but oh the bread ! <sssss> for me this is one of the best bread bakeries in a town that only has a handful of really good bread makers . <sssss> to celebrate such amazing bread , why not make amazing sandwiches ? <sssss> nancy 's favorite -lrb- $ 7.75 -rrb- arrived piled high with roast beef , gorgonzola and roasted onion spread , roasted red peppers , lettuce and tomato on a crusty baguette . <sssss> aside form the chewy flavorful baguette and the tender roast beef , the bold and creamy notes of the cheese spread makes this sandwich a stack-of-love . <sssss> by contrast the turkey jack stack -lrb- $ 7.75 -rrb- had a spicy bite thanks to pepper jack cheese and red onion . <sssss> the sourdough bread it was served on was so spongy and flavorful i ordered a loaf -lrb- $ 4.50 -rrb- to go . <sssss> unfortunately the park avenue chicken salad -lrb- $ 7.75 -rrb- was under-seasoned ; its only saving grace was the incredible raisin walnut pecan bread it was served on . <sssss> on my next visit , ill just pick up a loaf -lrb- $ 4.50 -rrb- of the bread and skip the salad . <sssss> when you order a sandwich you have your choice of potato salad , pasta salad , fruit , coleslaw or potato chips . <sssss> i might avoid the disappointing potato salad . <sssss> the potatoes were oven roasted which is great but the spuds were over cooked and dehydrated making for a chewy strange tasting mess . <sssss> the love does n't stop at their bread ; they make cupcakes that are moist and inviting . <sssss> on my last visit i picked up a red velvet cupcake -lrb- $ 2.75 -rrb- and a strawberry shortcake cupcake -lrb- $ 2.75 -rrb- . <sssss> on my way back home i could n't stop thinking about the cute little white box housing my treats . <sssss> once home , dessert came first ! <sssss> the shortcake cupcake was n't shortcake at all but made from angel food cake , then topped with real whipped cream and a glazed strawberry . <sssss> this was one of those desserts you savor and enjoy though i ended up eating the whole thing in about four bites , yes it was that good . <sssss> wiping the crumbs from my face i proceeded to convince myself that i would only have a single bite of the red velvet , wrong . <sssss> i could n't resist licking the cream cheese frosting off before devouring the moist and ultra chewy cake . <sssss> while there is still no concrete reason why a sandwich made by someone else 's hand is better , i do know this , i enjoyed trying to prove this one out .

HIG		the new 8,800-square-foot eddie v 's at scottsdale quarter includes three separate private dining rooms , in addition to the main dining areas , each with its own unique personality . <sssss> one room is dramatically situated in a round rotunda , where my partner and i had a wonderfully romantic dinner . <sssss> soft live jazz music played softly in the background while we enjoyed a cross section of delightful menu items . <sssss> dinner was truly memorable with a starter of tuna tartare . <sssss> beautiful sashimi quality tuna was set an top of diced mango then topped with just the slightest amount of sliced chile . <sssss> the heat was mild and only helped to accentuate the sweetness of the fish and mango . <sssss> this was followed up by a gorgeous long plate filled with a mix of lightly dusted flash fried calamari , julienne carrots and daikon drizzled with a sweet soy glaze . <sssss> my entree was on the lighter side but was heavy on flavor . <sssss> crab stuffed shrimp were excellent ; extra large shrimp were grilled then topped with sweet crab meat , panko bread crumbs and a lime finish . <sssss> i could n't stop eating there plump crustaceans . <sssss> i did however stop long enough to try my partners perfectly tender steak au poivre . <sssss> dessert was a new take on an old classic , bananas foster cake . <sssss> as our waiter dumped brandy on top of the cake and set it on fire , even head in the dining room was on us , was quite a sight . <sssss> the cake was the best finish to a extraordinary evening of food and romance .
LOW		sometimes you just dont get what you pay for . <sssss> like paying nearly 5 bucks for a large frozen yogurt and getting a less then half full cup . <sssss> then a buck for the first topping which was so stingy . <sssss> i chose mochi and seriously , there were about 6 pieces . <sssss> were not talking quality over quantity here . <sssss> . <sssss> the frozen yogurt was good , very light sour yogurt taste , not much tang . <sssss> i make the same recipe at home and its good but not 6 bucks a cup good . <sssss> maybe the lady there at chill saw my fat ass and decided that she needed to put me on a diet ! <sssss> i did have a taste of the gelato and thought it was really good . <sssss> . <sssss> i think if i go here again i will certainly stick with the gelato . <sssss> . <sssss> seems that those cups are literally packed . <sssss> you live you learn .
MID		me and the mr finally got a chance to go here . <sssss> . <sssss> simple , easy and well presented . <sssss> . <sssss> you cant go wrong here even though my fat ass only ordered a smoothie and steel cut oats . <sssss> . <sssss> now the mr he ordered eggs benedict . <sssss> . <sssss> huge yummy looking portion of ooey gooey eggy goodness . <sssss> . <sssss> i wanted to dive face first into his plate ! <sssss> instead i ate my oats and loved every bite . <sssss> . <sssss> perfectly cooked and served with brown sugar and milk , just like mom 's before her divorce introduced her to the single life . <sssss> oh those were the days . <sssss> id go at opening if you 're hungry 'cause there is always a wait !
MID		i get into these wild food moods where ill wake up and have a craving for something , its usually pretty specific , this particular morning it was corned beef . <sssss> sounds crazy but once i get it in my head i wont be satisfied until i give into my cravings . <sssss> i was n't hungry though for just any corned beef , it had to be boar 's head brand , aside from a few grocery stores the only place you can get boar 's head is a good delicatessen . <sssss> i knew just where to go , scott 's ! <sssss> situated between an ace hardware and a basha 's , this seems hardly the spot for a tasty sandwich . <sssss> let me tell you , they serve up massive tasty sandwiches with thick piled meat on your choice of bread and they have choices . <sssss> feeling helpless and at complete mercy to my urges i ordered scott 's perfect reuben-reuben -lrb- $ 11.50 -rrb- . <sssss> so tall you cant get your mouth around it , its stuffed with corned beef , swiss cheese and sauerkraut then grilled to a crispy buttery goodness . <sssss> when the server set my sandwich in front of me my eyes widened , it was a thing of beauty and desire . <sssss> as i managed my sandwich for the first bite , i felt the wafts of hot corned beef beckoning , eat me , eat me . <sssss> enjoying bite after satisfying bite , my morning craving was quickly becoming fulfilled like an ancient prophecy . <sssss> ordering a side of russian dressing to dunk my fries into may sound slightly odd but after one dip i think you 'll agree , its perfectly natural . <sssss> for the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices , scott 's does offer lighter fare such as salads , soup and half sandwiches . <sssss> however , i for one do n't go to scott 's to eat light , i go to scott 's eat well .
MID		stefano fabbri , owner of pomo pizzeria , is not only passionate about his food , but he has a contagious enthusiasm that 's informative and downright convincing . <sssss> the pomo pizzeria napoletana at the borgota in scottsdale is a sleek and beautiful space . <sssss> the dining room has soaring ceilings , dark furniture and a mural showing someone riding a scooter in the streets of italy . <sssss> it appears to be another trendy , albeit sexy , pizzeria , but it 's actually more than that . <sssss> pomo recently earned a certification from the naples-based associazione verace pizza napoletana , meaning that everything from the flour , olive oil , kneading and baking meets exacting standards . <sssss> this is a pretty big deal considering there are only a few dozen restaurants in the country that have this certification . <sssss> but the staff does n't let the honor go to their heads ; service is friendly and attentive . <sssss> pizza is the name of the game here , and seeing it prepared is a blast . <sssss> in the open part of the kitchen you 'll see a classic red berkel meat slicer used to prepare the selection of cured meats . <sssss> this is one serious meat slicer that i can only dream of having in my own kitchen . <sssss> to see it in action i ordered the affettati misti -lrb- $ 14.95 -rrb- , a plate filled with the chef 's choice of paper-thin slices of bresaola , prosciutto , salami , olives and cheese . <sssss> at lunchtime , pomo serves a handful of paninis , but these are not the typical grilled sandwiches . <sssss> they quick bake fresh dough in a blistering hot oven that yields a slightly charred , yet light and crispy bread . <sssss> then they stuff it full of italian goodness , like the salami panini -lrb- $ 9.95 -rrb- , which was filled with spicy salami , arugula and mozzarella cheese . <sssss> served with a simple side salad , the panini was excellent and satisfying . <sssss> like the panini , pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired oven at around 900 degrees . <sssss> this means that a pizza takes only about a minute and a half to cook . <sssss> by naples standards , the pizzas are decidedly thin though surprisingly the crust is n't ultra crispy as one might expect . <sssss> instead the crust is light and moist with an excellent toothsome chew . <sssss> fabbri recommended starting with the basics , and since he 'd know best , ordering the regina margherita -lrb- $ 11.95 -rrb- was on point . <sssss> the tomato sauce was bright and sweet , then the flavor of the milky fresh mozzarella kicked in which was enhanced by fresh chopped basil . <sssss> another way to enjoy the stupendous crust was the calzone napoletano -lrb- $ 14.95 -rrb- , which is not your run of the mill calzone . <sssss> it was filled with spicy salami , tomato sauce , mozzarella and ricotta . <sssss> each creamy bite deserved another , as i wickedly ate the whole thing . <sssss> what better way to end than to order dessert ? <sssss> while they do have standards like tiramisu -lrb- $ 7.95 -rrb- and panno cotta -lrb- $ 7.95 -rrb- , the light and airy semifreddo di mandorle -lrb- $ 7.95 -rrb- was a standout . <sssss> each bite of the partially frozen mousse was accented with a toasted pistachio crust . <sssss> more please . <sssss> with a passion for tradition , this might be as close to an authentic italian pizza as you 'll get without going to italy .
LOW		a shiny and sleek interior , an innovative and locally sourced menu , all brought to you by a celebrity chef is everything tee pee mexican restaurant is not . <sssss> instead you get a divey old building , vinyl booths , a ceiling adorned with christmas tree lights and an old school tex-mex menu that 's simple , satisfying and inexpensive . <sssss> each table is automatically adorned with a pitcher of ice water and a squirt bottle filled with tee pee 's own hot sauce . <sssss> within moments of being sat into one of the comfy old vinyl booths a large bowl of chips is brought out and accompanied chunky salsa . <sssss> the chips are humongous , essentially a medium corn tortilla cut in half and deep fried to till crisp . <sssss> i just wish that on my last visit the humidity from the rain had n't made the chips more chewy than crunchy . <sssss> the chunky salsa was bursting with freshness and a slight throat burn more indicative to pepper than chile . <sssss> either way , i love built in appetizers . <sssss> i 'm a cheese crisp fanatic , almost as much as i frenzy over good chicken wings . <sssss> so i consider myself an expert by way of sheer cheese crisp volume consumed over the course of my lifetime . <sssss> having chowed on so many , there have been many great and not great , the later being a greasy flaccid disappointment . <sssss> so what 's great about the green chili strips cheese crisp -lrb- $ 6.75 -rrb- from tee pee ? <sssss> the truth in advertising . <sssss> pick up a slice and you 'll find its truly crisp and rigid being followed by thick ropes of gooey melted cheddar cheese . <sssss> green , smooth and easy to spread , the guacamole dip -lrb- $ 5.50 -rrb- while good was lacking any discernible heat . <sssss> after all we 're at a mexican food restaurant and should n't we deserve a little bit of heat ? <sssss> next time ill ask if they can make it spicy . <sssss> the beef fajita chimichanga -lrb- $ 11.25 -rrb- is an ode to everything that is right about fried food . <sssss> huge flour tortilla filled with tender well seasoned grilled beef , onions and bell peppers , then rolled and deep fried to delicate crunch . <sssss> the french fried burrito is covered with the usual suspects including red sauce , lettuce , tomato , cheese , sour cream and a healthy dollop of guacamole . <sssss> i did n't feel an ounce of guilt eating the entire thing . <sssss> what 's good mexican food without a mainstay like sour cream enchiladas -lrb- $ 8.00 -rrb- ? <sssss> corn tortillas encircle molten cheddar cheese and sour cream then draped with tee pee 's savory red sauce . <sssss> as soon as the plate arrived i could tell that these were going to be good . <sssss> oh , by the way , when they say these plates are hot , they are n't kidding . <sssss> seriously , do no touch these or you will get burnt , i speak from experience on this one , heed their warning . <sssss> however , the fieriness from the plate further enhanced the slightly smoky red chile sauce , making it that much more tangy and delicious . <sssss> both entrees were served with moist fluffy rice and thick cheesy refried beans . <sssss> show up in shorts and t-shirt , i do n't think you can ever be undressed at tee pee but that 's all part of the charm . <sssss> come as your are , even if you get enchilada sauce all over your shirt , no worries , pre-treating will take it right out .
LOW		so we 've been hearing all sorts of buzz about culver 's . <sssss> . <sssss> the famous butter burger and frozen custard place from wisconsin . <sssss> so we piled in the car and headed out to mesa . <sssss> when we got there the place was packed . <sssss> . <sssss> we stood in line for 10 minutes before it was our turn . <sssss> the service is very friendly and super helpful . <sssss> we even ordered the flavor of the day , caramel cashew swirls and were told we could pick that up later so it did n't melt while we ate our dinner . <sssss> . <sssss> that was very cool ! <sssss> anyway , you place your order and they give you a number so they can bring it out to you when its ready . <sssss> . <sssss> another nice touch . <sssss> well after we got our food , butter burgers , fries and cheese curds we felt well , kind of let down . <sssss> the burgers here are alright , kinda greasy and lacked a good beef flavor . <sssss> the cheese curds were also deep fried -lrb- as most on the menu -rrb- and were good but not as good as i was hoping . <sssss> the crowd there . <sssss> . <sssss> it was like i was in iowa or something . <sssss> . <sssss> definite walmart crowd . <sssss> . <sssss> i sat there and watched this kid pick his nose and then proceed to fill his soda cup from the soft drink fountain . <sssss> . <sssss> uhm , yeah . <sssss> . <sssss> i just looked at my cup and thought about all the other people who touched that button . <sssss> . <sssss> suddenly did n't feel very good . <sssss> we got our frozen custards . <sssss> . <sssss> eh , very very smooth and creamy but to me just tasted like ordinary soft serve ice cream . <sssss> cashews were salty and nicely roasted , a good contrast to the smooth custard but lack depth and interest in the overall taste of the frozen custard . <sssss> i probably would n't ever go back here . <sssss> . <sssss> though the service is great and is priced well , i just do n't think the food was worth the drive back out to mesa .
MID		okay so theres a time in a persons life where they like to have choices . <sssss> . <sssss> lots and lots of choices . <sssss> . <sssss> well living in the southwest choice is abundant , so much so that the lists can be pages long when it comes to food and drink . <sssss> its really overwhelming ! <sssss> the mr and i like to take weeknight foodie plunges . <sssss> generally on weeknights i 'm slaving over a hot wok , comal or grill while the mr ` works ' late , just managing to show up just in time to eat -lrb- life seems so unfair does n't it ? <sssss> -rrb- ! <sssss> so when he got home last night and did n't see dinner ready he knew it was plunge night . <sssss> we both knew it had to be some sort of sandwich . <sssss> we 've been wanting to try a new place not to far from home called andreoli 's but for some reason i thought they close early . <sssss> so then i was up to bat . <sssss> . <sssss> torta 's ! <sssss> oh yeah and i saw a write up in the new times last week for a place on 16th street . <sssss> so we piled into the honda and headed west . <sssss> this place is only a few blocks south of the famed bario cafe . <sssss> inside the place has been updated with tin roof walls and a clean open appearance . <sssss> inside oddly enough was a very attractive blond woman -lrb- think uma thurman -rrb- cleaning off the tables . <sssss> she was the nicest person i had met in some time ! <sssss> she walked us through the menu answering our questions and making many suggestions . <sssss> we finally ordered 2 torta 's and a quesadilla -lrb- a gurl has got to eat ! <sssss> -rrb- ! <sssss> she then invited us to their salsa bar . <sssss> . <sssss> 3 different salsas , pickled carrots/jalapeno and freshly sliced cucumbers . <sssss> oh , beware . <sssss> . <sssss> the salsa 's are on the spicy side and may cause pooper fire syndrome ! <sssss> the tray arrived with our mexiches and quesadilla . <sssss> . <sssss> the mr bit into his pastor -lrb- 4.99 -rrb- and his eyes widened as if to attempt to make his mouth bigger by intimidation . <sssss> large cubes of pork simmered in a spicy red sauce inside of nice thick bun that had been lightly toasted . <sssss> on to my cubana -lrb- 5.90 -rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> this bad boy is also on a toasted bun though inside . <sssss> . <sssss> ham , roast pork , milaneza , cheese , lettuce and mayo . <sssss> whew , it was good good good . <sssss> as we were noshing through the torta 's the quesadilla caught my eye . <sssss> it looked so lonely sitting there with melted cheese oozing from the edges . <sssss> . <sssss> so seductive , enticing . <sssss> . <sssss> fresh . <sssss> i had to take a bite ! <sssss> yeah babe , you 're so good . <sssss> the alambre -lrb- 4.99 -rrb- is filled with onions , cheese , beef and pork slices on a very large flour tortilla . <sssss> . <sssss> this alone was worth the drive ! <sssss> the texture of the onions and cheese against the tender meats and crispy tortilla was just delish ! <sssss> this paired nicely with the horchata -lrb- 1.99 -rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> silky smooth and not overly sweet . <sssss> i guarantee next week when the mr gets home and the kitchen is dark and empty he will know it his turn to buy dinner !
LOW		for a good cause . <sssss> . <sssss> that 's what i kept telling myself when we pulled up to sauce at the canal -lrb- waterfront , puhlease ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> me and the mr headed over to sauce after our reservation for digestif fell through -lrb- thanks guys ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> we were very animate about supporting the dining for life cause so this was the next best thing . <sssss> . <sssss> well , maybe those are a poor choice of words . <sssss> the thing is we did n't want to drive all the way to downtown phoenix . <sssss> . <sssss> so since there were only a handful of places . <sssss> . <sssss> anyway , i have never been a fan of fox concepts . <sssss> . <sssss> mediocre food set into sort of cool spaces . <sssss> sauce is no different . <sssss> . <sssss> sort of cool industrial interior , down beat music and wine only 5 bucks a glass . <sssss> the concept is great its just that the food is terrible on all levels . <sssss> from the salad with next to no toppings . <sssss> . <sssss> to the shitty totino 's style pizza -lrb- yep , ate that shit when i was a kid -rrb- to the horrible pannini . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> . <sssss> the food is so simple you think it would be great . <sssss> . <sssss> its just does n't work . <sssss> . <sssss> i think the ingredients are to scant and the quality is so so . <sssss> i gave one star for the lasagna which did n't suck as bad as i thought and the staff . <sssss> . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and attentive . <sssss> now if the food was better , well , i think we 'd have a winner .
MID		from the time you enter till the time you depart , christopher 's exudes a comfortable luxury . <sssss> sleek elegant lighting casts upon gorgeous wood and glass surfaces accented with pops of orange and brown . <sssss> deep overstuffed chairs that cradle and beckon you to stay a while longer . <sssss> these elements combined with a james beard award winning chef sets the stage for romance and sophistication . <sssss> chef-owner christopher gross ' latest restaurant is located in the updated biltmore fashion park adjacent to sak 's fifth avenue . <sssss> main parking can be intolerable and downright frustrating , though if you enter towards the back , there is plenty of good parking in the structure . <sssss> beyond the warm greeting from the hosts , there are 2 distinct spaces in the restaurant ; one side is christopher 's and the other crush lounge . <sssss> at crush , have a seat in one of the cushy banquettes and enjoy a menu of small plates , pizzas and wine . <sssss> on the other side , christopher 's is the more formal dining space and while sophisticated is by no means stuffy . <sssss> christopher 's menu is mostly french inspired , though i think of it as well traveled with hints of italian and asian . <sssss> chef gross ' worldliness comes from positions in paris , london and normandy . <sssss> with so much expertise , it 's no wonder he has been awarded so many accolades , including afore mentioned james beard award for best chef southwest . <sssss> ordering up some `` first plates '' to share , alsatian onion tart , -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- a rectangle of flaky puff pastry adorned with sweet caramelized onions , bacon and a salad of frisée dressed with pungent vinaigrette will awaken your palette . <sssss> i could have easily eaten the whole thing rather than just a few bites . <sssss> creamy terrine of hudson valley foie gras -lrb- $ 24 -rrb- was neatly placed along side a brandied date tart , points of toasted brioche and a drizzle of pedro ximénez wine reduction . <sssss> this was slow eating at its finest as i built each component onto the end of my fork . <sssss> a salad composed with delightfully salty duck confit -lrb- $ 16 -rrb- mixed greens , humboldt fog cheese and cognac infused cherries was a triumph . <sssss> but the butter poached lobster -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- with fresh greens , pine nuts and roasted fennel vinaigrette was better and now my new favorite . <sssss> how about a few suggestions for your main course ? <sssss> definitely the smoked truffle infused filet mignon -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , tender , earthy and ambrosial . <sssss> we also enjoyed the 12 oz . <sssss> new york steak -lrb- $ 34 -rrb- , cast iron seared and pepper-crusted . <sssss> heightened with cracked pepper , the beef flavor was piquant and juicy . <sssss> consider a few sides too , such as the mac n'cheese au gratin -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- with velvety cream sauce spiked with ham or the additively smooth gruyère pommes purée -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- . <sssss> and maybe a vegetable , the brussels sprouts -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- were a special that night , deliciously bitter and sweet . <sssss> while the fare was delightful and service professional , each course became more strained as the night wore on with our waiter disappearing for long periods of time . <sssss> finally having to ask for the check , we decided to skip the sweets , there simply was n't room . <sssss> chef gross has it going on here , fantastic food , a great wine list and most of all my new favorite date spot .
LOW		me and some of the boys were feeling like ribs after seeing sweeney todd . <sssss> . <sssss> yeah we 're sick like that . <sssss> . <sssss> would have preferred meat pies . <sssss> . <sssss> anyhoo . <sssss> . <sssss> got there during lunch time . <sssss> . <sssss> i 'm not a fan of the whole corporate shtick and this place is well . <sssss> . <sssss> all shtick . <sssss> . <sssss> from the ` leg lamp ' to the bottle caps glued on the wall this place is actually more kitsch and not in a good way . <sssss> i would like to say though that the chair i sat in was so comfortable that i could sit and stare at all the crap on the walls for hours . <sssss> i mean seriously , there is tons of stuff on the walls there , dizzying . <sssss> being the adventurous one , ordered the fried pickles . <sssss> . <sssss> ya know you had to order at least once to say you tried them . <sssss> . <sssss> well , i would n't order those again . <sssss> . <sssss> let 's just say i like my pickles firm ! <sssss> i ordered the trip tip salad for my lunch . <sssss> . <sssss> not much to say about it . <sssss> . <sssss> it was what it was . <sssss> . <sssss> overly sweet bbq ranch dressing with a few pieces of tri tip -lrb- was very tender -rrb- all covered in cubes of cheese . <sssss> in fact none of us even ordered the ribs * sigh * . <sssss> the service was super slow though food is priced well and the portions very large . <sssss> typical corporate experience not to good , not to bad just ho hum . <sssss> . <sssss> will probably not return . <sssss> prefer joe 's bbq for the time being .
HIG		i could n't possibly think about standing around outside waiting for a table at pizzeria bianco . <sssss> so why not make the best of it and come next door to bar bianco . <sssss> a great wine list and an awesome selection of craft beers all reasonably priced ! <sssss> but the big allure for me is the old house that bar bianco is housed . <sssss> its just an amazing old house that has been lovingly cared for . <sssss> all the details are still there and you can tell this place had a lot of love in it . <sssss> the second you walk through the door the place has a just walked into grandma 's house , make yourself at home kind of feel . <sssss> you cant go wrong here . <sssss> .
LOW		at $ .39 an ounce this is another pay as you go self serve yogurt shop to hit the valley . <sssss> they have the usual suspects , tart , vanilla and also several different `` skinny '' versions which are `` no sugar , which means they do n't add any but does contain sugar , so beware . <sssss> on my visit they were out of ` skinny blueberry . <sssss> . <sssss> rats ! <sssss> had a cup of the skinny yogurt . <sssss> . <sssss> again the cups are huge much like yogurtology so you can over indulged quite easily . <sssss> i was ready this time and only took just a little bit . <sssss> the topping bar look great though nothing to really set it apart from the other place with the exception of the fruit looking and tasting fresher . <sssss> while there is no `` skinny '' tart version , the vanilla was decent enough with only a slight weird chemical after taste .
MID		after the mekong visit and my patience worn completely thin i decided to go somewhere where the wait wasnt an hour . <sssss> so headed to leelee and decided to try the attached restaurant there . <sssss> whats funny is i passed 6 other pho places along dobson on my way . <sssss> . <sssss> it was a sign ! <sssss> being in the mood for beef stew , i was told # 48 was beef stew . <sssss> so , ordered that to go . <sssss> when i got it home i was shocked to see that it was pan cooked beef chunks with onions and sauce served over the top of lettuce and tomatoes . <sssss> i was like fuck , that 's gross ! <sssss> well , i had to take a bite , then another , then another , then another . <sssss> . <sssss> it was really good ! <sssss> not the bo ko i was craving but tasty none the less . <sssss> the lettuce had wilted and was similar to a stew cause of all the moisture that was released . <sssss> . <sssss> a very good dish ! <sssss> ill have to go back to try the pho . <sssss> . <sssss> though with all the other pho options i think a tour is in order . <sssss> . <sssss> anyone wan na do a dobson pho tour ?

MID		when i pulled up i was very skeptical of this place . <sssss> . <sssss> kind of old and run down and in a sort of off part of 16th street next to circle k. . <sssss> well i was meeting friends and amy d. had talked so highly of it so i could n't back out now . <sssss> my friends showed up and were kind of scared though they have n't been out with me for ages so it would be an adventure for them . <sssss> ill dodge bullets for a good bite to eat and they know it ! <sssss> burgers , fries shakes and a few odds and ends on the menu well , here it goes . <sssss> ordered a half pound burger with cheese and a side of fries , 4.99 as well as a strawberry milkshake . <sssss> . <sssss> i was making sure we all ordered what they are known for , good burgers , fries and shakes . <sssss> . <sssss> okay , so i 'm blown away ! <sssss> the burger was totally juicy without being greasy . <sssss> . <sssss> the fries were crispy and flavorful and the shake tasted like it should have . <sssss> . <sssss> thick , creamy and fruity ! <sssss> my friends all loved the food here and were thanking me on the way out . <sssss> . <sssss> so much for it being scary . <sssss> lucky boy rocks ! <sssss> the burgers remind me of how a good burger should be , simple , tasty and cheap . <sssss> now that 's american !
LOW		searching for a lunch option after a hard shop at costco we deiced to check this place since it was just around the corner . <sssss> this place is a little bit dirty , the first table we were sat at was covered in ants . <sssss> . <sssss> we told the waiter and he shrugged and i asked if we wanted to move ?! <sssss> hello ?! <sssss> no i want to sit with the ants . <sssss> . <sssss> maybe they will like some chips and salsa also ? <sssss> dipshit . <sssss> anyway , the service and kitchen were pretty quick . <sssss> ordered a cheese crisp which was actually really good . <sssss> . <sssss> super crispy , melty cheesy goodness . <sssss> . <sssss> the mr ordered a grilled chicken ceasar salad . <sssss> . <sssss> im like wtf ?! <sssss> i ordered the pollo chicken something . <sssss> . <sssss> you know the one with the deep fried chicken burrito smothered in cheddar cheese and cream cheese . <sssss> . <sssss> it was pretty good i suppose but the rice was so dry i thought it was uncooked . <sssss> . <sssss> the mr 's salad was way over dressed . <sssss> . <sssss> well duh ! <sssss> all in all this was place was just so so . <sssss> . <sssss> the ants were a real turn off . <sssss> . <sssss> for this style of mexican id say that there are other places who do it better and cheaper . <sssss> i wonder how those ants would have tasted deep fried ?
HIG		another great offering from fox concept restaurants . <sssss> bravo . <sssss> the building looks like a giant barn , and the interior resembles a barn as well . <sssss> but do n't be fooled ; this restaurant is clean as a whistle and the lighting is spot on . <sssss> the servers and bartenders are dressed in jeans and other farm attire so they do look a little goofy , but it works . <sssss> it just works . <sssss> the bartenders actually care about you enjoying your experience . <sssss> they 're not there to puff up their chests and flex for the girls . <sssss> these guys know customer service and they are spectacular . <sssss> the food ?! <sssss> heavenly . <sssss> the arancini was perfect and the sauce divine . <sssss> but the real treat was the main course : i tried the bolognese , which is something i have perfected -lrb- in my opinion ! <sssss> -rrb- at home . <sssss> i 'm very picky . <sssss> luckly , they did not disappoint . <sssss> the bolognese was very moreish and i could not stop eating . <sssss> i left a very happy man . <sssss> kudos to the guys scurrying around in the open-air kitchen ! <sssss> and now for my one -lrb- and only -rrb- bitch about this restaurant : and i nearly took away a star because of it . <sssss> just as the sun was setting , the bartenders took it upon themselves to open all the window-doors surrounding the bar . <sssss> it 's nice , but only when it 's 79 degrees outside ! <sssss> and the sun ... burst forth and blinded me along with anyone else sitting westward . <sssss> all the nice cool air just slipped out the restaurant and it became quite uncomfortable . <sssss> yes , i know it 's friday night and you want the restaurant to seem as open as possible ... but it 's already a barn ! <sssss> you do not need to open all the windows in the middle of summer ... and especially when the sun is still able and willing to stun and piss off your diners . <sssss> this restaurant , despite the only one flaw , is a masterpiece . <sssss> -lrb- and guys , stop going out in public wearing flip flops or sandals . <sssss> you all look ridiculous . <sssss> -rrb- i step off my soapbox .

MID		nice place to grab a sandwich for lunch ! <sssss> very fast , efficient and friendly workers . <sssss> a diverse menu to select from . <sssss> i had a panini sandwich and it was pretty tasty . <sssss> food was made to order and still came out amazingly fast . <sssss> the food prep area was kept very clean . <sssss> as for the dining area , it was a little neglected , and because of this , there were many people circling about looking for clean tables . <sssss> otherwise this is a very decent restaurant . <sssss> too bad they 're not open on sundays .
HIG		i am no expert on korean food , and i will never be . <sssss> oxknee soup ? <sssss> how does one eat an animal 's knee ? <sssss> huh ? <sssss> whatever . <sssss> what i had was wonderful . <sssss> i had beef in very hot , boiling broth with cabbage and carrots . <sssss> also had pork , which was more flavorful than i was expecting . <sssss> there 's several items on the menu that was completely alien to me , so i can not vouch for the more exotic items they offer . <sssss> but if you like korean , and/or want to try something new -lrb- and really good ! <sssss> -rrb- , then check this place out .
HIG		awesome place to go for a burger ! <sssss> the burgers are cooked to order , which makes it well worth the wait . <sssss> the chicken tacos are awesome as well , despite the fact i do not like cilantro all that much . <sssss> the fries are good , and the lemonade is simply fantastic . <sssss> the cheery employees helps set this place apart from any other . <sssss> they really make you feel welcome and appreciated . <sssss> the stand is also very well organized and clean . <sssss> a very good indicator that the staff take pride in their job . <sssss> i will be back , that 's for sure !
MID		just fantastic . <sssss> the lobster bisque soup could have been a meal all unto itself . <sssss> the bbq pork sandwich was phenomenal . <sssss> but the secret behind this place is its employees . <sssss> they 're fast , efficient , and always on task . <sssss> they scurry around as if their workplace was a hive . <sssss> i 'll definately be back .
HIG		this is the very best -lrb- and inexpensive -rrb- vietnamese food you can get in phoenix . <sssss> i can not convey how flavorful and wonderful and fresh the food is . <sssss> do n't know what you want ? <sssss> no problem ! <sssss> just point randomly at the menu and order something . <sssss> service : a little on the slow side , but the food is so good that i do n't care . <sssss> that 's a very high compliment from me , because i 'm not forgiving . <sssss> ambiance : none . <sssss> this place is a dump , and i do n't care : this is phoenix , so we 're all trash anyway ! <sssss> -lrb- especially you , scottsdale snobs , i know who you are ! <sssss> lol -rrb- the fluorescent lighting is lurid and harsh on the eyes . <sssss> no music playing . <sssss> it 's a miracle that the sagging ceiling did n't fall upon our heads . <sssss> this restaurant is literally on its last legs . <sssss> very much in need of a remodel and a makeover . <sssss> so , put on your dirty soiled wife beater , and your flip flops , and you 're set . <sssss> da vang is devine !
MID		the awesome thing about this restaurant is the front of house staff . <sssss> they are always friendly , attentive , and just fun to talk to . <sssss> they make you feel at home . <sssss> the food is wonderful , and the decor is just as wonderful . <sssss> the parking , however , is impossible after 10am . <sssss> go early . <sssss> the kitchen area is a little disorganized and disheveled , but the kitchen staff manages to crank out quality and good tasting dishes at a good pace . <sssss> i 'll definitely be back . <sssss> the food and service is superior . <sssss> i 'll just avert my eyes next time i 'm standing towards the kitchen . <sssss> ok i 'm lying : i always look and can not stop .
HIG		this is the place to go . <sssss> always busy , lunch or dinner , and their food is always superior . <sssss> i 've eaten here many times and i 'm never disappointed . <sssss> their sushi is wonderful -lrb- i wish you guys would serve halibut !! <sssss> -rrb- and their noodles are out of this world . <sssss> love the soba , chicken parmesan , and especially the salmon cream sauce . <sssss> looking upon the menu , a newcomer would think that the owners are crazy ; this place offers cuisine from thailand , korea , japan ... and italy ... but they do it well . <sssss> i can not rave enough about their kitchen and the guys scurrying like madmen at the grill . <sssss> bravo . <sssss> bravo goes out to yuka , who is the real star of the show . <sssss> she 's a fantastic server . <sssss> after knowing her for a couple of years , she now greets me with a hug and an ever-present loud and genuinely warm greeting . <sssss> i will never tire of this place . <sssss> cherry blossom noodle cafe sets the bar high and keeps it there .
LOW		zinburger is a very decent place to go for a burger . <sssss> i ordered a burger with wild and morel mushrooms , cooked medium . <sssss> it was tasty and cooked to perfection ; however the morel mushrooms were literally pulverized along with all the other mushrooms . <sssss> you could n't differentiate between them in the miasma . <sssss> my only criticism about the burger is that if you are going to use a very expensive ingredient , please do not destroy it and make it unrecognizable . <sssss> the fries were hot and fresh , and the ranch dressing i asked for was tasty . <sssss> my friend ordered his burger medium rare , and unfortunately it arrived medium well . <sssss> he ate it anyway because he was hungry and did n't want to wait any longer -lrb- they were very busy so the long wait for our food is forgiven -rrb- . <sssss> the hostesses and servers buzz around the restaurant as if it were a hive ; constantly cleaning , picking over the tables , asking if anyone needed anything . <sssss> this is awesome . <sssss> the only bad thing about the atmosphere is the customers , themselves ! <sssss> the crowd was very loud . <sssss> screaming children , women drinking too much wine and talking at the top of their lungs when it 's not necessary to . <sssss> it 's a very loud experience . <sssss> i will be back . <sssss> definitely not on a packed saturday night , that 's for sure .
LOW		alright first things first : the service is phenomenal . <sssss> the hostess was sweet and looked back twice to make sure we were following her . <sssss> the server was hilarious -lrb- her name was julia ? <sssss> -rrb- and she was spot-on the entire time . <sssss> i noticed another server who was meticulously polishing silverware , flattening out napkins and folding them perfectly , and carefully setting his table as if it were for his very own wedding banquet . <sssss> i rarely see this kind of attention to detail . <sssss> the restaurant is extremely clean . <sssss> i was also impressed when the servers come around with a tray of sliced limes , lemons and oranges for our water and iced tea . <sssss> very impressed ! <sssss> the food is a bit of a letdown . <sssss> the thin crust pizza was surprisingly flabby . <sssss> i mean , is n't thin crust pizza supposed to be crispy ? <sssss> the chicken parmesan was burned . <sssss> why oh why put a pile of arugula on it and leave the sauce on the side ? <sssss> fail . <sssss> i 'll be back , i suppose , but there 's dozens of other restaurants to try out lol come here for the service . <sssss> keep your expectations low on the food so that you wo n't be disappointed .
HIG		i 'm very excited about this place . <sssss> it reminds me of a long-gone coffee shop in sedona called cups . <sssss> no two chairs , tables , or coffee cups were the same . <sssss> there was artwork packed on the walls made by local artists ... all for sale ... and the place was charming . <sssss> but no more . <sssss> it got bulldozed for the sake of a larger strip mall . <sssss> progress , right ? <sssss> urban beans reminds me of cups . <sssss> most of the chairs and tables are wildly different -lrb- some of the chairs are too wild ... they are impossible to walk around which can be a nuisance if the place is busy -rrb- , and there is some art on the walls available for sale . <sssss> the pastries are wonderful , and their menu items are fantastic . <sssss> the coffee tastes wonderful , and i should know , because i 've been in the industry for many years . <sssss> the people behind the counter are helpful and friendly . <sssss> ca n't ask for more . <sssss> the only critique is that the walls are a bit in a state of disrepair and the lighting needs to be tweaked a bit . <sssss> this location is on the brink of becoming a top notch place to go . <sssss> phoenix lacks culture and art -lrb- first friday is a laughable waste of time -rrb- , and urban beans stands to be the game-changer in this arena . <sssss> take note , phoenix ! <sssss> urban beans is a wonderful hangout , and it poised to start a new trend in coffee shops and hangouts . <sssss> i am exited to see what the future holds .
HIG		this place is n't much to look at ; in fact it 's terrifying . <sssss> they have christmas ornaments with lights stung up all year long , which is bizarre . <sssss> but so what ... their breakfast sandwiches are delicious , greasy , and just bad for you . <sssss> very enjoyable . <sssss> if you want a `` feel good '' moment , come here for a breakfast croissant . <sssss> and now on to the star of the show : donuts . <sssss> made fresh every day . <sssss> if you come early enough -lrb- the earliest i came was at 4am on valentine 's day ! <sssss> -rrb- the donuts are still warm . <sssss> i can not say in just one post how delicious and awesome their donuts are . <sssss> greasy , decadent , bad for you ... something for everyone ! <sssss> yes this is as good as it gets , folks . <sssss> try this place out , either for breakfast and/or donuts . <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed .
MID		it 's awesome to have a movie theater with no kids . <sssss> it 's awesome to have a movie theater where the white trash behind you can not kick your chair . <sssss> food : better than any other movie theater around . <sssss> chicken tenders are awesome , and when i ask for extra ranch dressing , oh boy do they comply . <sssss> this is my favorite theater and i can not say anything better .
HIG		love the look of the restaurant . <sssss> very clean and comfortable . <sssss> service is stellar . <sssss> the staff are knowledgeable and are helpful without being overly intrusive . <sssss> the real star of the show here is the food . <sssss> simply amazing . <sssss> i love how the menu is partitioned . <sssss> the dishes come in appetizer portions for sharing , which means you can sample a good part of the menu in just one visit . <sssss> cheese curds : you can not go wrong . <sssss> lightly battered and fried in new oil ; yes i can taste and see the difference ! <sssss> pea shoot salad : a revelation . <sssss> pea shoots ? <sssss> bacon ? <sssss> it works ! <sssss> and the parmesan tuille is the stuff of legend . <sssss> i normally do n't order salads in restaurants , but this wins me over . <sssss> a must try ! <sssss> beef milanesa : simply put , one of the most flavorful dishes on the menu . <sssss> beet canneloni : tastes like a dessert ! <sssss> wonderful ! <sssss> tuck shop is one of the finest restaurants in phoenix to take a date to . <sssss> hurry ! <sssss> go !
HIG		i adore this restaurant . <sssss> i just love it . <sssss> i 've eaten here more than a dozen times . <sssss> it 's a shame i have n't gotten around to writing any reviews . <sssss> so here i go ! <sssss> good to be able to see the kitchen . <sssss> not the cleanest in the world , but it certainly does n't scare me off . <sssss> the head chef/owner never takes any days off . <sssss> he 's always there , cooking up a frenzy . <sssss> i admire his work ethic . <sssss> the food is amazing . <sssss> love the dragon eggs -lrb- crispy -rrb- for the appetizer . <sssss> their galee gai is simply delicious . <sssss> their awesome soup tom yum gai is worthy of an award . <sssss> you can go anywhere you want on this menu and you wo n't make any wrong turns . <sssss> the only comment -lrb- note that it 's not a complaint -rrb- is that some of their servers do not have full command of the english language . <sssss> knowing that they emigrated from thailand and seeing their extremely cheerful disposition just makes everything ok . <sssss> just speak slowly and be understanding : they are , after all , in a big and strange country . <sssss> if you happen to have the same server i had , just smile and be nice . <sssss> you 'll be justly rewarded ! <sssss> this restaurant sets the standard of service , food quality and overall experience . <sssss> i can not wait to go back .
LOW		this gets three tentative stars . <sssss> it 's advertised to be the largest indoor butterfly atrium in `` the americas '' and i suppose that is true . <sssss> but the experience overall was extremely underwhelming and i will tell you why . <sssss> first , the good . <sssss> the butterfly exhibit in boston is much smaller than this place . <sssss> it 's actually more like a closet than anything . <sssss> so the good news is that scottsdale 's exhibit beats boston 's by several factors . <sssss> now , the bad . <sssss> i went to the butterfly exhibit in xcaret last year and it was four times bigger than scottsdale 's . <sssss> butterfly wonderland measures ten thousand square feet ... xcaret is forty-thousand and is two full levels . <sssss> now back to butterfly wonderland : after paying the fee -lrb- $ $ $ ! <sssss> -rrb- you go down a hallway showing meager butterfly art . <sssss> then you 're led into the theater , where you see a brief 3-d movie on monarch butterflies . <sssss> nice movie . <sssss> it 's definitely geared for kids , so it 's very streamlined and the language of the movie is oh-so-easy to understand ... but the sheer simplicity of the movie means that lots of information gets weeded out . <sssss> i am an information geek . <sssss> cram my cranium with it ! <sssss> i can take it . <sssss> even as a child , i could . <sssss> all that information would entice me to buy books , research , maybe even plant my own butterfly garden so that i can be a part of the action ... so all too soon , the movie ends . <sssss> and you are led to the butterfly atrium . <sssss> the atrium itself is very nice , and it should be , since it is brand new . <sssss> thousands of butterflies abound ! <sssss> in the air , clustered around flowers , gathering upon each other to get at bowls heaped with cut fruit . <sssss> ten thousand feet is ten thousand feet ... and all too soon you walk in your little semi-circle and it 's over . <sssss> i walked slowly , took many pictures and some videos , and was still in and out of the `` largest atrium of the americas '' in less than 12 minutes . <sssss> after leaving the atrium was a tinny ant exhibit , bee exhibit , scorpion exhibit , and then some aquariums filled with fish you can see at the pet store . <sssss> the lighting was pretty bad . <sssss> many signs were permanently hidden in shadows , making them very difficult to impossible to read . <sssss> as for the fish and other creatures , the tags just showed their names but no other information . <sssss> where do they live ? <sssss> why are they featured ? <sssss> what do they eat ? <sssss> are they endangered ? <sssss> these are questions that children and adults ask . <sssss> so , the next stop was a stingray tank , which you can step up to . <sssss> being able to touch these magnificent animals is definitely a highlight . <sssss> however . <sssss> at the wildlife world zoo , you can purchase some food for a buck or two and actually feed these graceful creatures . <sssss> then there is the obligatory gift shop ... for kids . <sssss> not too many items that would interest an adult . <sssss> and remember , i 'm just a big kid at heart ... so i know that the chinsy toys offered just did n't cut it for me as a child as well . <sssss> the effort that went into this place is tremendous . <sssss> but it 's very small and you can seriously be done with the whole thing in less time than it took to drive here . <sssss> i know and understand that they have to cater to the mentality of children , but that does not mean you have to dumb yourself down . <sssss> challenge children to think ! <sssss> challenge their geography ! <sssss> challenge their vocabulary ! <sssss> teach them to read and write cursive ! <sssss> but i digress . <sssss> this is certainly worth a look . <sssss> and a look is all you will get . <sssss> you 'll get some very nice pics from the atrium . <sssss> other than that , i recommend the wildlife world zoo .
LOW		the last time i ate here , the service so bad that i walked out . <sssss> so here 's my attempt to see if they got any better : food : a-ok . <sssss> nothing special , but certainly not bad at all . <sssss> i could see the kitchen from my booth , and let me tell you : the guys scrambling around in the tiny cook/prep area are cranking out the food ! <sssss> they move around like a blur . <sssss> i rarely see such productivity any more . <sssss> thumbs up to the kitchen staff ; you guys rock it out ! <sssss> service : barely courteous . <sssss> i think our server made eye contact once . <sssss> the server was quick and attentive , which is probably more than you can expect , especially for a place like this . <sssss> i will say this : the servers at this location take a lot of crap from the customers . <sssss> i see and hear them too . <sssss> in our server 's defense we did arrive just as the sunday church crowd was abating . <sssss> i know how awful the church crowd are . <sssss> and i know they are usually terrible tippers . <sssss> our waiter was probably worn out by the time we got there . <sssss> will we be back ? <sssss> maybe . <sssss> i 'm still in love with the stand . <sssss> but 5 & diner is n't all that bad . <sssss> we 'll see .
LOW		i 've eaten here many times and this is the first time i did not get pizza . <sssss> i regret this . <sssss> their pizza is phenomenal , so if you want a great pizza , this is the place to go . <sssss> the service is always top notch and the cleanliness of the parlor is always noticed . <sssss> side note : i love the herb garden at the entrance ! <sssss> nice touch . <sssss> however . <sssss> this last trip i decided to order something other than pizza . <sssss> starting off with halibut crudo , i would not wrap my brain around all these strange flavors that should not be on the same plate . <sssss> radish , corn and halibut . <sssss> too contrasting . <sssss> and corn is just too sweet ! <sssss> a very odd dish that left me frowning . <sssss> next was a very-difficult-to-eat burger . <sssss> i ordered the bacon and gorgonzola burger and was dismayed at the bullet-like pickles in the sandwich . <sssss> they poked up through the bun ! <sssss> are n't pickles supposed to be cut into thin disks ? <sssss> not these . <sssss> these suckers made their presence known , and i had to pick them out of my sandwich . <sssss> i 'll come here again , but i 'm going to stick with what i know : their pizza . <sssss> buon appetito !
HIG		yet another phenomenal meal . <sssss> had the dragon eggz which were tangy as ever . <sssss> also tried the turtle island crab , which is literally a deconstructed won ton . <sssss> just brilliant . <sssss> and the perfect thing to have during the awful phoenix summer ! <sssss> for dinner i ordered the temple of fire , and they were n't joking . <sssss> it would be nice if they would n't pound the chicken flat as a pancake , though ! <sssss> cook the whole thing and cut it up , instead ! <sssss> pounding a chicken flat makes it tough . <sssss> the service was stellar as always . <sssss> our server was cheerful , and on point .
LOW		i read the awesome reviews on this site , therefore my expectations were high . <sssss> after all , phoenix is plagued with awful chinese restaurants . <sssss> our entire dinner was bland . <sssss> the sauce that accompanied the fried wontons was insipid and flavorless . <sssss> red , thick sauce should be sweet . <sssss> this was not . <sssss> unimpressed . <sssss> the pot stickers were ok , but nothing special enough to write home about . <sssss> i was leery about ordering the tangerine beef , because i had a rancid dish of the same name from a different chinese restaurant a couple years ago . <sssss> thought i 'd give it a go . <sssss> bland . <sssss> beef pounded into oblivion smothered with a sauce so faint that it cried for flavor . <sssss> the sesame chicken , bland as well , was overcooked and nowhere near as sweet as one should like . <sssss> the kung pao chicken was the least amusing dish of all . <sssss> no flavor , no heat , and no veggies . <sssss> the mu shu pork was ok , but the plum sauce was , again , bland ! <sssss> now , the cleanliness and presentation of the restaurant was in face phenomenal . <sssss> very clean and the lit candles on the tables were a very nice touch . <sssss> the service was legendary . <sssss> very chipper , friendly , and at times amusing . <sssss> there was an older lady whose job apparently was to take dirty dishes from the tables and only says `` thank you ! '' <sssss> when she does anything near you . <sssss> i noticed that a great many of the diners were very elderly . <sssss> is there a retirement village nearby ? <sssss> do you not realize that the elderly love buffets and bland food ? <sssss> this restaurant was full of both , and i think it was the army of elderly people with diminishing taste buds who wrote all those glowing reviews . <sssss> i understand that people have varying opinions and tastes , but come on ! <sssss> raise your standards and start asking yourself if the food you are tasting really deserves four or five stars ? <sssss> fail .
MID		my husband and i came here to see star trek : into darkness at the cine capri . <sssss> this was our first time and we were not disappointed . <sssss> this harkins is ginormous ! <sssss> the lobby is large and then the actual theater and screen are huge ! <sssss> we did n't grab anything from the concession stands , but they seemed to have a rather large selection . <sssss> then , inside the theater , the traditionally red seats were comfy and relaxing . <sssss> we had a perfect view of the screen . <sssss> the screen itself was huge and encased by curtains . <sssss> before the movie started , a harkins employee -lrb- dean -rrb- introduced the movie . <sssss> the curtains swung open and created an experience . <sssss> overall , it was a little cold inside , but most theaters are too cold for me . <sssss> we 'd definitely go back and see another movie here .
LOW		my husband and i came to fuego tacos when they were having a special fixed menu and were pleasantly surprised . <sssss> we both had a drink , an appetizer to share , our own entrees , and a dessert to share . <sssss> for our drinks , i had this rum concoction that was both really fruity and strong . <sssss> i really liked it ! <sssss> my husband had this ginger ale drink - like a dark and stormy . <sssss> he was n't too impressed , but he did n't come for the drinks anyway . <sssss> for our appetizer , we had the empanadas - puff pastry with ground beef and cheese . <sssss> i really liked these , but another miss in my husband 's eyes . <sssss> for dinner , we each ordered a signature entrée - two tacos with rice and black beans . <sssss> the black beans were lacking in flavor - no spices at all ! <sssss> however , the tacos were good . <sssss> i ordered the pernil asado , which is pork with mango salsa . <sssss> my husband ordered the short rib barbacoa , which had hints of pineapple and spice . <sssss> while they are not the best tacos in the world , we enjoyed them . <sssss> as our evening came to a close , our waitress forgot to bring our dessert out and we had to remind her that we ordered the churros . <sssss> she quickly brought us out some . <sssss> again , not the best churros , but still cinnamony and sugary . <sssss> our experience was n't bad , so we came back another time to enjoy dinner . <sssss> this time the place was n't as packed as our first time here and the tacos tasted the same . <sssss> overall , it 's a decent place but parking is a hassle . <sssss> if it was located somewhere else , we 'd probably frequent it more often .
HIG		i had been meaning to try federal pizza since they first opened up but kept putting it off because i felt like it was just going to be another pizza place . <sssss> boy was i wrong ! <sssss> those guys and gals at upwards projects definitely know how to create a winning restaurant ! <sssss> my husband and i stopped here for a late lunch and ca n't wait to come back . <sssss> since it was such a nice day , we sat on the cute patio and were able to enjoy the slight breeze . <sssss> our waitress was very friendly and helpful . <sssss> we ordered the mister mister - a platter of deep friend goodies . <sssss> this included sweet potato , zucchini , artichokes , and mozzarella . <sssss> the mozzarella was definitely my favorite . <sssss> i liked the other vegetables as well , but the artichokes -lrb- which i normally love -rrb- did n't really do it for me . <sssss> the leaves were too crispy . <sssss> for our pizza , we ordered the brussels sprout - roasted brussels sprouts , pancetta , and manchego cheese . <sssss> oh . <sssss> man . <sssss> new favorite pizza . <sssss> the crust was soft and crunchy , the sprouts were well cooked and tasty , and i loved the bite of the cheese . <sssss> mmm . <sssss> we took home our leftovers and ate it for dinner that night ! <sssss> i would go back for this pizza alone , but they also have several other pizzas that look delicious . <sssss> i also want to go back to try their cobbler dessert -lrb- made with churn ice cream -rrb- and i heard their homemade wine coolers are good . <sssss> i 'll definitely be back and soon !
LOW		i stopped in here for an iced peppermint mocha because i had heard good things on yelp and it was on my way . <sssss> i know , it 's more of an ice cream place , but i heard the espresso was good and being lunch time , i opted to save the ice cream for another time . <sssss> it was around 1pm on a thursday that i stopped in , so right after the lunch rush . <sssss> it was n't really busy inside , but a group of three women were ahead of me and taking their sweet time trying to decide what to get . <sssss> after about 10 minutes of fidgeting , it was finally my turn to order . <sssss> the gal behind the display case was super sweet and really nice - even apologizing it had taken so long . <sssss> she made my drink super-fast and asked me how it tasted . <sssss> i commented it could use a little more peppermint , so she was happy to add some more to make it extra minty . <sssss> it was good , but not my favorite . <sssss> i could n't really taste the espresso nor the mocha , but definitely could taste the peppermint . <sssss> i also ordered a brownie , which was cake-like with fudgy frosting on top . <sssss> the service was fantastic and i 'll have to come back and try the ice cream .
MID		normally i 'm not a big chain restaurant frequenter but i like that the keg steakhouse sends me an email where i can get $ 25 off a birthday dinner . <sssss> thus , the husband and i went recently for my birthday and it was delicious . <sssss> i ordered the filet oscar , which is a tenderloin wrapped in bacon and topped with shrimp , scallops and asparagus with béarnaise sauce . <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> the steak was medium-rare , which made a tender meal . <sssss> i normally really like béarnaise sauce but this sauce was overpowering - wish i ordered it on the side . <sssss> the shrimp and scallops were fantastic though . <sssss> the husband ordered one of their specials , i ca n't remember which , but it was steak and it was cooked just right . <sssss> both of us got the twice baked potato which is really fluffy with bacon bits . <sssss> for desert we ordered the billy miner pie . <sssss> husband loved the pie . <sssss> our waitress was super perky and friendly . <sssss> she was able to offer different items on the menu and segway into holiday meals without seeming harsh or pushy . <sssss> great service ! <sssss> overall , it 's a good time that we enjoy once or twice a year .
MID		oh thai house , you crazy . <sssss> when we first walked in at 11:30 am , the thai house was packed . <sssss> no seating anywhere , except for the three seats at the tiny bar . <sssss> we grabbed those chairs and held on tightly . <sssss> -lrb- good thing too since a line started to form at the door ! <sssss> -rrb- during our entire time here , the three servers were swamped ! <sssss> they were continuously running back and forth between the kitchen , cash register , and dining tables . <sssss> it was a mad house ! <sssss> luckily , it did n't take much time to order or receive our food . <sssss> this place is very efficient . <sssss> we ordered the lunch specials - pad thai for me and panang chicken for my husband . <sssss> holy moly , so much food ! <sssss> not only do you get your dish , but you get a side of fried rice or white rice , and either soup or salad . <sssss> we both opted for fried rice and soup . <sssss> the soup was egg drop and while it was good , i thought it needed salt . <sssss> i loved the fried rice - it had the normal mix-ins -lrb- egg , carrot , peas -rrb- but the flavor was really good . <sssss> my pad thai was good as well , but there was so much that i have lunch for tomorrow . <sssss> my husband liked his panang chicken and ate every bite . <sssss> between us , we shared a thai iced tea . <sssss> it tasted like the thai iced tea i had at osha thai , which is good . <sssss> i 'm sad thai house does n't have thai iced coffee , but i 'll get over it . <sssss> we had a great meal that was pretty inexpensive , especially since there 's left overs . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back !
MID		another food truck thursday and my husband decided to try hey joe ! <sssss> he ordered the pancit -lrb- rice noodles -rrb- and a lumpia -lrb- egg roll -rrb- . <sssss> i was lucky enough to get to try both items -lrb- by try i mean steal off his plate -rrb- . <sssss> the food was freshly made to order and came out quickly . <sssss> the noodles were delicious with their saucy ways . <sssss> also the vegetables were delicious . <sssss> my husband enjoyed the chicken it came with as well . <sssss> i particularly enjoyed the lumpia - one of the better egg rolls i 've had . <sssss> super crispy and tasty . <sssss> overall , i enjoyed their food and would try again .
MID		i like this bookman 's . <sssss> they have a wide variety of items from books , music , movies , video games , musical instruments and what i refer to as `` garage sale junk '' . <sssss> the `` junk '' is unique memorabilia -lrb- including action figures , toys , etc -rrb- and random statues , plates , candle holders , home decorating items , etc. - just a bunch of random stuff from a variety of decades . <sssss> sometimes there can be good stuff -lrb- the cute owl figurine i purchased -rrb- or not . <sssss> coming to bookman 's is like signing up for a treasure hunt where you might not find anything good at the end but you keep coming back because you have found good stuff previously . <sssss> i 've purchased books , movies , and video games here . <sssss> the best part is that you can trade-in items you no longer want and either get cash or store credit . <sssss> you receive almost double store credit than cash and if bookman 's has something good , then it 's a great deal . <sssss> i would definitely recommend trading in some items you no longer use/want .
HIG		a while ago the words `` hot dog '' and `` food truck '' would have made me cringe . <sssss> combine those words and i 'd turn green . <sssss> short leash dogs has changed my mind and has me wagging my tail . <sssss> short leash is a food truck that offers gourmet hot dogs , sausages , and brats all from a local vendor - schreiner 's sausages . <sssss> they can be found where most food trucks convene around town , but i enjoy them every third thursday of every month at whole foods raintree . <sssss> they have 5 regular `` combos '' , a weekly special , and build your own . <sssss> the build your own is rather daunting , as there are so many toppings . <sssss> i love that they come on naan bread instead of hot dog buns . <sssss> -lrb- the naan bread is super soft , so you know it 's fresh . <sssss> -rrb- they also have corn dogs for the kids or young at heart . <sssss> -lrb- they are delish . <sssss> -rrb- the line can be long , but the actual service is quick and friendly . <sssss> also , a long line indicates how good the food is ! <sssss> and let me tell you , it 's good ! <sssss> i 've had a brat , an italian sausage , and the `` adult '' corn dog -lrb- jalapenos and cheddar -rrb- . <sssss> my friend had the veggie dog and said it was delicious . <sssss> i would definitely recommend this place and look forward to trying everything on the menu !
MID		corbin 's is practically right down the street from where we live and we love going here when we do n't really want to travel far . <sssss> their happy hour food is fantastic , especially the fish tacos . <sssss> flakey and moist fish deep fried to perfection inside a flour tortilla with coleslaw . <sssss> mmm . <sssss> another favorite is the mesquite smoked pork quesadilla . <sssss> the quesadillas are stone-fired and the smoked pork is so flavorful and moist . <sssss> absolutely melts in your mouth and very filling . <sssss> we 've had the via mexico salad , grilled salmon , via de nachos , and beef tenderloin sliders previously and all were fantastic . <sssss> definitely a great place for dinner with friends or even those pesky in-laws . <sssss> we recently discovered they do brunch and what a fantastic brunch . <sssss> we 've tried all four of the crepes on the menu and have n't strayed . <sssss> the country crepes are my favorite if you want something savory -lrb- think all the breakfast foods rolled up into a crepe and them smothered with gravy -rrb- . <sssss> the husband likes the chicken pot pie crepes , and while i like a hearty pot pie , i do n't think it translates well as a crepe due to the sauce being inside the crepe and an additional sauce on top . <sssss> -lrb- sauces within sauces ! <sssss> -rrb- their sweet crepes really hit the spot if you 've got a sweet tooth . <sssss> the apple walnut crepes are filled with mascarpone and cream cheese and then topped with apples and walnuts . <sssss> i 'm not a big cooked apple fan , but i 'll make the exception with this dish . <sssss> the stanberry crepes are good , but they are simply topped with cream and strawberries - there 's no filling on the inside . <sssss> this is a turn off for me , but if you request some mascarpone/cream cheese , they 'll promptly deliver . <sssss> on a side note : i 've had the coffee here a few times , but each time i 'm left wondering why i did . <sssss> it 's a bit on the weak side and when i add cream it does n't improve . <sssss> i 'll admit i 'm a coffee snob , but i seem to be the only one complaining . <sssss> the building is hard to miss since it 's a bright yellow , but the parking lot is easy to get into and there 's almost always space . <sssss> the inside is nice and modern and sitting on the patio is enjoyable . <sssss> overall , if you are ever in the area , definitely stop in , no matter what time of the day .
HIG		i am so in love with their salted caramel sauce ! <sssss> i could put it on anything and be a happy lady . <sssss> luckily , churn has plenty of ice cream flavors and other treats to douse in that sweet caramel goodness ! <sssss> the vietnamese coffee ice cream is an absolute favorite of mine . <sssss> it 's pure sweet , creamy coffee with espresso bits . <sssss> yuuuum ! <sssss> i also really enjoy their vanilla - simple yet delicious . <sssss> i love the inside . <sssss> it 's cute and brightly decorated . <sssss> the shop is pretty small , but it seems much larger . <sssss> the employees have always been super nice and friendly . <sssss> always quick to smile and encourage delicious decisions . <sssss> churn , churn , churn ... this is my mantra whenever i crave ice cream . <sssss> i chant their name out loud so my husband knows to prepare the automobile for delicious discoveries . <sssss> i wish churn was closer to home , but it is definitely worth the drive .
MID		this aj 's has got some great lunch options , especially outside at the grill . <sssss> however , the parking is terrible ! <sssss> this entire plaza has the worst parking ever . <sssss> granted , it 's got several different places for lunch and the lunch crowd is vicious , but my husband and i can never find parking . <sssss> luckily , we work close enough so that we can walk over comfortably and do so frequently . <sssss> the grill makes excellent mushroom burgers . <sssss> the burger is flavorful and cooked perfectly to medium-rare and the mushrooms are sautéed just right . <sssss> the grill always gets my order right and i like that . <sssss> the inside lunch area usually has revolving items that are really tasty . <sssss> their coconut chicken was really good - sweet and juicy . <sssss> i like that they always have vegetable sides along with some guilty pleasures -lrb- french fries anyone ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the soup here is also really good and something my husband really enjoys . <sssss> to finish off lunch , the bakery always has tempting treats that are really tasty . <sssss> we come here frequently for lunch or if we need a specialty item , but beware the parking ! <sssss> either come before or after the lunch rush if you want a spot that you did n't have to fight battle royale over .
HIG		i love the cookies , but i love the cupcakes even more . <sssss> ollie cakes has to be my favorite cupcake shop in the phoenix area and you 'll find me there almost every weekend . <sssss> for a while , all i would eat was the coconut cupcake -lrb- mmm -rrb- but i 've finally tried all the regular flavors . <sssss> every cupcake is super moist and the frosting melts in your mouth perfectly , but here 's a few highlights ... the brown velvet - oh , how i love this cupcake . <sssss> the chocolate cake is super moist and the cream cheese frosting pairs really well since it is super creamy . <sssss> if you 're in the mood for double chocolate , definitely get the chocolate cupcake . <sssss> the frosting is deep and chocolately , like a thick ganache . <sssss> if you like carrot cake , you should definitely get this cupcake . <sssss> it does have nuts in it , but that definitely adds to the off the charts awesome flavor combined with cream cheese frosting . <sssss> -lrb- as a side note , their vanilla buttercream frosting is amazing . <sssss> while it is really buttery , it tastes `` real '' - definitely not your supermarket 's frosting . <sssss> -rrb- sometimes they 'll have special cupcakes - like their german cupcakes or their s'mores . <sssss> if they have a special cupcake , definitely get it ! <sssss> you 'll be in for a treat . <sssss> i could go on and on about all the cupcakes , but you should really go try them yourself . <sssss> the location is nice , but if they do n't have their sign out front , you might drive right by . <sssss> the inside is cute and displays the treats loud and proud . <sssss> what are you waiting for ?
MID		i love lgo pizza but always hated the parking situation . <sssss> luckily , they now have a valet service and if you get your valet card stamped , it 's free . <sssss> this makes it all the more enticing . <sssss> my favorite pizza is the mushroom party - crimini , button , and oyster mushrooms . <sssss> i 'd like to try the mother earth because that sounds delicious -lrb- tons of vegetables -rrb- but that 'll have to be next time . <sssss> their crust is both crispy and soft - a good combination . <sssss> i have n't had any appetizers but they definitely have a large variety of items to choose from . <sssss> if you are in the mood for pizza and want to try something different , this is going to be your new spot . <sssss> do n't forget to valet !
MID		i 've been to the biltmore shopping center plenty of times but never really `` shopped '' . <sssss> i mainly come for the numerous restaurants they have ! <sssss> the entire complex is really large and can be confusing when walking around , but i do n't mind since it is outdoors and very inviting . <sssss> i do n't want to call the biltmore a mall , but it 's very similar to an outdoor mall . <sssss> however , i feel like it is less gimmicky than desert ridge or tempe marketplace . <sssss> there are plenty of places to sit and relax - really relax . <sssss> i like that you can unwind , when the temperatures are right ! <sssss> overall , the biltmore is nice to window shop as i 'm on my way to one of the numerous restaurants in the area .
MID		this was my second dining experience at fleming 's and instead of dinner , my husband and i came for happy hour . <sssss> it was a beautiful evening , so we decided to sit on the patio . <sssss> we had a gorgeous view of the mountains and setting sunset ! <sssss> our waiter was quick to arrive and super enthusiastic , friendly , and helpful . <sssss> throughout the night , every employee that stopped by our table was just as friendly and helpful . <sssss> it was great service the entire night . <sssss> the happy hour menu is titled `` 5 for $ 6 '' . <sssss> that 's 5 cocktails , 5 wines , and 5 appetizers each for $ 6 . <sssss> the cocktails all seemed to be different martini variations - some with rum , others vodka . <sssss> i asked about the tropical martini since i love tropical drinks -lrb- pineapple , oh yesss -rrb- . <sssss> our waiter described it in great detail and said how delicious it was , so i had to order it . <sssss> after one sip , my husband decided he needed one as well . <sssss> for appetizers , we ordered the calamari , the pork belly , the burger , and salt/pepper shrimp with green beans . <sssss> we also ordered a cup of the french onion soup , since it 's my favorite . <sssss> the calamari and soup came out first . <sssss> our waiter split the soup into two for us , so we did n't have to fight over one bowl . <sssss> it was delicious ! <sssss> the calamari my husband really enjoyed but i thought was just okay . <sssss> it was a little too chewy for my tastes and the breading was falling off . <sssss> next , our pork belly , burger , and shrimp came out . <sssss> the shrimp was delicious . <sssss> there were five large shrimp breaded in a salt/pepper batter and deep fried to perfection . <sssss> the green beans were also coated and fried . <sssss> i really enjoyed the shrimp and could have eaten more . <sssss> the pork belly was delicious as well . <sssss> it came with grits and onion chutney . <sssss> the chutney alone was savory and sweet ; very tasty . <sssss> when added to other items , it made the other items delicious . <sssss> my husband really enjoyed the pork belly and ate most of it . <sssss> the burger was good , but nothing amazing . <sssss> it had cheddar cheese and bacon , which was a plus . <sssss> we could n't finish the burger , as we were so full from the other items ! <sssss> overall , it was a great experience and we will definitely be back again !
HIG		i 've been to lgo a few times before and knew the parking was terrible - little did i know they had valet parking . <sssss> valet was the way to go ! <sssss> as i walked up , i saw tons of patrons inside the pizzeria enjoying their dinner and it looked so good . <sssss> i could n't wait to try the sweet treats waiting inside . <sssss> upon entrance , i was greeted with four different types of gelato from grateful spoon . <sssss> i was told they hand-make each batch from scratch - they even pasteurize their own milk ! <sssss> there was dark chocolate , greek yogurt , peach , and mint . <sssss> the dark chocolate was my favorite - it was smooth and tasted how a fine chocolate bar would . <sssss> the peach was extremely tart . <sssss> it was good , but i was n't expecting that . <sssss> it was really fresh and would be great on a hot summer day . <sssss> the mint - oh god , it was like a mint explosion in my mouth . <sssss> i ca n't tell if i liked it or not - it was excruciatingly minty and sweet . <sssss> emily g. said it was like a `` mojito on ... crack '' and i agree . <sssss> as i enjoyed my gelato , i made my way into the back room . <sssss> i felt like i was at a warehouse unveiling party and getting a peek into something no one has ever seen before . <sssss> i saw some folks come out with treats and empty plates , but i was n't expecting the entire space to be jam packed with yelpers and sweet treats . <sssss> oh god , it was sensory overload . <sssss> the first thing i zeroed in on where the hand made and freshly grilled english muffins . <sssss> they were enormous and hot . <sssss> so , so good . <sssss> i grabbed a blueberry muffin as well , debating over a croissant or scone . <sssss> i decided i 'd have to try those later . <sssss> then i wandered past the drink station filled with water and champagne . <sssss> i wish they had milk - that would have been fantastic to wash down all the treats but champagne was a nice touch . <sssss> then i moved onto the cookie station . <sssss> let 's just say cookie monster would have been in heaven . <sssss> these cookies were huge - like the size of a frisbee . <sssss> i grabbed a chocolate/pecan cookie , but all of them looked so good . <sssss> i had to move on to the cake and cupcake stations . <sssss> the layered cakes looked so delicious and i am glad they had small servings to try . <sssss> the chocolate cake with vanilla frosting was my favorite . <sssss> -lrb- i think i know what i 'm getting for my birthday ! <sssss> -rrb- i also tried a fluffer-nutter cake sample and the marshmallow crème was delicious ! <sssss> super fluffy and tasty - definitely a decadent treat . <sssss> at the cupcake station , i only tried a small chocolate cupcake but it was delicious . <sssss> after this event , i feel like a piñata - stuffed with sweets and ready to burst ! <sssss> i waddled out of this event in a daze with an amazing goodie bag to share . <sssss> i 'm sure the valet guy thought i was delirious or near a diabetic coma , but it was worth it . <sssss> i am eager to bring others back at a later date to enjoy all the goodies .
MID		my mom came up for the weekend to celebrate her birthday and after deliberating between the princess and the westin , she choose the westin . <sssss> it was a great choice . <sssss> i had never been to the westin previously , but upon first arrival it was a simple yet lush experience with a nicely manicured lawn , trees , bushes , and tons of blooming flowers . <sssss> just beautiful . <sssss> parking was rather easy as well and it was a quick jaunt to the lobby . <sssss> inside the lobby is spacious with beautiful tile work . <sssss> there is ton of signage directing you where to go and plenty of places to see and go . <sssss> we traveled downstairs to the nellie cashman 's monday club cafe for brunch -lrb- see review - http://www.yelp.com/biz/nellie-cashmans-monday-club-cafe-scottsdale#hrid:r2uz8fs3a7t6zqveqjjfta -rrb- . <sssss> on our way , we saw they had some snakes and a gila monster on display . <sssss> it was really neat to see the wildlife - especially the gila monster . <sssss> -lrb- he crawled around very slowly and yawned numerous times . <sssss> too cute ! <sssss> -rrb- then , we were able to use the pool and lazy river . <sssss> the pool area is huge - tons of shady seating , a large pool , a 900 foot lazy river , a 110 foot slide , and an outdoor bar/grill . <sssss> we were really excited for the lazy river and hopped in . <sssss> the lazy river had three different types of floating devices - a baby blue two-seater tube -lrb- so two could enjoy the ride together -rrb- , a dark blue tube with a cup holder and back support , and a green tube with a cup holder . <sssss> -lrb- we were recently at the squaw peak lazy river and they only have one type of tube - single capacity , no back support and no cup holders !!! <sssss> -rrb- i was really excited about the cup holder aspect . <sssss> the best part was that the river was n't too crowded . <sssss> there were plenty of tubes floating around , the kids were well behaved , and there was n't any rough housing . <sssss> i was in heaven . <sssss> after much lazy time , i took a trip down the slide to cool off completely . <sssss> it was fun , but compared to a few other slides i 've been on , it seemed short . <sssss> back into the lazy river . <sssss> we spent a good three hours on the river and really enjoyed ourselves . <sssss> luckily , my mom got a hotel room really close to the pool so it was easy to get back to the room . <sssss> inside , there was a really nice king bed , a pull out couch , and the normal amenities . <sssss> the bathroom was really nice with a glass shower stall and a bathtub . <sssss> my husband and i live pretty close to the westin and i know we 'll be back for a stay-cation . <sssss> it was that much fun !
LOW		this might shock you , but i do n't like subway and i do n't like places that are in a similar vein . <sssss> blimpie 's - no , thanks . <sssss> quizno 's - nope . <sssss> which wich - meh . <sssss> the only redeemable factor about which wich is that they have milkshakes , really inexpensive milkshakes . <sssss> try $ 2.75 for a small , which is a great price compared to other places that sell shakes . <sssss> my husband and i received a few giftcards for which wich and now we can buy hundreds of milkshakes . <sssss> if we did n't receive the giftcards , we would n't go to which wich otherwise . <sssss> we have had sandwiches and salads from here , due to business lunches , but they are pretty mediocre . <sssss> the french dip was decent but even quizno 's has a better french dip . <sssss> i do like that they have plenty of vegetarian options - which include pesto and hummus . <sssss> their pesto is decent ; i liked it on my pesto , mozzarella , and tomato sandwich . <sssss> however , the two times i 've ate here , they 've messed up my order . <sssss> the first , i placed an order online for pickup and they forgot the sauce that comes with the french dip and they forgot the chips i ordered . <sssss> the second time , i ordered a chocolate malt shake and they forgot the malt . <sssss> luckily , they did correct these situations once brought to their attention . <sssss> however , for a place that basically prides themselves on made-to-order entrees , they need to get it together . <sssss> i 'll be back , giftcard in hand , but when that baby runs out ... probably wo n't be back .
HIG		we came here during restaurant week and were not disappointed ! <sssss> we liked it so much , we came back another day for lunch and ca n't wait to come back again ! <sssss> for restaurant week , we made reservations at 6:30 pm . <sssss> we made the mistake of thinking zinc was inside the scottsdale quarter , not kierland commons . <sssss> however , it was a short walk over and it was nice to see the different shopping areas . <sssss> upon our arrival , it was n't necessary for a reservation , as the place was n't too busy . <sssss> they had seating both inside and out - we chose outside since it was still cool enough to enjoy the weather . <sssss> we were brought water and bread with butter . <sssss> our waitress showed up next and she was super nice and helpful . <sssss> we placed our orders - i chose the onion soup , medium rare flat iron steak , and chocolate soufflé with valrhona chocolate sauce . <sssss> my husband ordered the pork torchon with grilled brussels sprouts , grilled swordfish , and chocolate soufflé with gran mariner chocolate sauce . <sssss> our first course arrived shortly and it was fantastic . <sssss> i loved my soup - with the crisp and goey cheese on top and warm oniony goodness below . <sssss> i did n't want to share . <sssss> my husband 's pork torchon was good , but not my favorite . <sssss> -lrb- it was like a pate - he liked it but said he 'd order something different next time . <sssss> -rrb- then came our entrees . <sssss> my steak looked and tasted amazing . <sssss> it had a peppery sauce on it and it melted in my mouth . <sssss> it came with pomme frites - which my husband liked more than me . <sssss> my husband 's swordfish presentation was beautiful and just as tasty . <sssss> the swordfish was like a steak in itself - sort of like a tuna steak . <sssss> it was n't a flaky fish at all . <sssss> then the cous-cous that came with it was delicious with tiny bits of pork in it . <sssss> both entrees were delicious . <sssss> finally , dessert . <sssss> oh man . <sssss> i poured all the chocolate sauce on my soufflé and dug it - it was so warm and delicious . <sssss> my husband 's gran mariner sauce was just as delicious but not as thick as mine . <sssss> overall , it was a great experience . <sssss> our next lunch date here was just as good but definitely not as decadent . <sssss> i ordered the omelet with ham and gruyere cheese . <sssss> this came with a side stack of potatoes au gratin . <sssss> my husband ordered the seafood bouillabaisse which i thought was tasty . <sssss> we will definitely be back for dinner again soon . <sssss> i can already taste the steak and soufflé !
MID		we have been here twice for dinner and ordered the same salad , but different pizzas . <sssss> the pesto salad - grape tomatoes , pine nuts , roasted potatoes and parmigiano with pesto dressing . <sssss> so , so , so good . <sssss> the vegetariana pizza - mushrooms , artichokes , zucchini , and red peppers in quadrants . <sssss> it 's like 4 different pizzas in one . <sssss> the second pizza had prosciutto on it , but i ca n't remember the exact name . <sssss> it was , as expected , delicious . <sssss> i wish we could go here more often , but being downtown it 's farther from us than we 'd like . <sssss> overall , the food and price are comparable to our other favorite places to grab pizza . <sssss> i noticed that they do brunch and i ca n't wait to come back !
MID		i had been dreading coming to the airport and finding out that lgo had a location made me feel better . <sssss> while our flight was n't in section d , we had enough time to kill so we scrambled on down . <sssss> i ordered the commuter sandwich and the havana latte . <sssss> my latte was divine - sweet and tasty . <sssss> the sandwich was so large we could have shared . <sssss> their homemade english muffins are to die for and i could have just eaten that . <sssss> my husband ordered a caesar salad . <sssss> the salad was meh . <sssss> there were tons of to-go salads in the display case and my husband figured that 's what they were - to-go salads . <sssss> since we were sitting down and eating he thought they would make the salad fresh and bring it out on a plate . <sssss> nope . <sssss> the employee grabbed a box and handed it to my husband . <sssss> there was n't a lot of salad in the large box and the crotons were soggy from being inside the box . <sssss> overall , the freshly made items were delicious and the bakery case was full of tempting treats . <sssss> if i come back through the airport , i 'll definitely be grabbing a latte and sweet treat .
MID		my favorite drink here : shiso horny . <sssss> that name alone should sum up the outlandishness that is this rock 'n' roll themed karaoke sushi bar . <sssss> the inside is both cavernous and cramped . <sssss> when you first walk in through the giant green door , it 's like you are entering the walk-in closet of a japanese slot machine hoarder . <sssss> you have the option of sitting inside or on the patio , or renting one of their three karaoke rooms . <sssss> we almost always sit on the patio since the inside is so dark that i 'm afraid i might wind up in the wrong bathroom . <sssss> the karaoke rooms are nice , although intimidating as you are being led down a dark hallway to a room in which your companions will most certainly make fun of you . <sssss> depending on your group size , 5 could fit comfortably in the smaller room whereas 8 is pushing the limits -lrb- imagine spilled drinks and dropped sushi -rrb- . <sssss> they larger room is intended for 10 - 15 and is pretty spacious . <sssss> the sound system takes a bit to get used to , especially figuring out if it 's plugged in correctly or trying to input numbers for the song selections . <sssss> once you get the hang of it , its smooth sailing and the only bumps are trying to decide which song to sing next . <sssss> the happy hour here is fantastic - half priced karaoke rooms , maki , appetizers , sake , and house specialty drinks from 4 - 7pm every day . <sssss> we can get away with a ton of food for very little money - it 's great . <sssss> i think we 've tried almost everything in the appetizer section - our favorite being the teriyaki ribs . <sssss> then , we normally order the dragon roll . <sssss> their sushi is good , standard for the most part , but the specialty rolls have some pretty cracked out names . <sssss> one of our favorites is the gaijin - a chimichanga styled sushi roll , deep fried and delicious with cream cheese and avocado . <sssss> we have n't ventured much into the other areas of their menu - salads , noodles , etc. . <sssss> the green tea gelato is good , but we 've had better that tasted less freeze burnt . <sssss> -lrb- if you want ice cream after this meal , definitely walk around the corner to lee 's ice cream liquor - alcohol infused ice cream to die for ! <sssss> -rrb- i would definitely recommend this for happy hour or a birthday with friends .
MID		the husband and i had driven by hula 's multiple times , saying it looked interesting but we were always on our way to another destination . <sssss> we finally stopped in on their 3rd anniversary and boy , are we glad we did . <sssss> the wait for a table was probably 45 minutes , but the place was packed and in all consideration , it was n't as long as other places we 've been . <sssss> plus , we wanted to sit outside , since a band was going to be playing . <sssss> -lrb- who were awesome , btw . <sssss> -rrb- drinks were $ 3 all night , special anniversary prices , and we tried the dr. funk and the painkiller . <sssss> the dr. funk was delicious ! <sssss> the painkiller is similar , but had cinnamon or another spice in it that i did n't care for . <sssss> i ordered the coconut shrimp egg rolls to get us started and they were fantastic ! <sssss> for dinner , i had the coconut encrusted butterfish and the husband had a pork plate . <sssss> -lrb- mine was delicious but the pork was just okay . <sssss> -rrb- our friends had steak tacos and a salad . <sssss> the steak tacos looked so good , we had to come back a second time . <sssss> the second time here , i had the steak tacos and the husband had the steak dinner . <sssss> mmmm , the steak tacos were totally worth it . <sssss> -lrb- we also ordered the coconut shrimp rolls again - definitely a favorite . <sssss> -rrb- for dessert , we got the brownie with macadamia nut ice cream . <sssss> the brownie was n't anything special but the ice cream was good . <sssss> when we checked in on yelp , we received $ 5 off our bill . <sssss> this was a nice surprise ! <sssss> totally check this place out - we 'll definitely be back !
LOW		we used to come here a lot more frequently , but then they changed their fry recipe . <sssss> the new fries are n't terrible , but they taste like disappointment . <sssss> and disappointment tastes pretty bad . <sssss> if you like kettle chips , imagine them thicker , hotter , and with a hint of rosemary . <sssss> that is how the old fries tasted and we could n't get enough of them . <sssss> now when we go here , it 's usually because the husband is craving their peppercorn hamburger . <sssss> i always order the mushroom burger and it 's really good -lrb- juicy and flavorful -rrb- , but do n't put green stuff on my mushroom burger . <sssss> we have n't ordered much else off the menu , except once i ordered the special which were three mini shrimp po ` boys . <sssss> that was a mistake - burgers are definitely their specialty . <sssss> overall , if we 're craving hamburgers with fries , i 'd rather go to delux or the parlor -lrb- which has some of the best fries -rrb- . <sssss> if you do n't care about fries , then give the grind a try , because their burgers are thick , juicy , and flavored just right .
MID		this was my second time to the rhythm room and it was fantastic ! <sssss> we saw `` mother mother '' this time and `` patrick watson '' the time before . <sssss> both performances were stellar and rhythm room is such a great venue . <sssss> it creates an intimate experience between you and the performers . <sssss> you really get to hear the music and connect . <sssss> it 's also nice that there 's a bar , so you get some drinks while you watch . <sssss> the location is pretty good and the parking is n't terrible . <sssss> the bathrooms could use some updating , but overall , for an older and more intimate music venue , this place has got it going on . <sssss> i can not stress how nice it is that this place is smaller and more of an experience than when you go to a venue that accommodates thousands upon thousands . <sssss> -lrb- waay too crowded ! <sssss> -rrb- i love it when bands go to the rhythm room ! <sssss> i 'll definitely be back .
LOW		3.5 - i 'm a fan , but it 's a-ok . <sssss> the first time we ever came here i had a potato soup with blue cheese and bacon . <sssss> it was fantastic . <sssss> since then , the husband has had their fish and chips , corned beef , and the shepard 's pie . <sssss> all were good , standard irish pub fare . <sssss> the best deal they have is their $ 5 burgers . <sssss> every monday any burger on the menu is just $ 5 and it comes with one side -lrb- fries , mashed potatoes , salad -rrb- . <sssss> it 's close to our work and you 'll know where to find us on mondays . <sssss> the wait staff is super nice and even noticed i had dyed my hair -lrb- since we are there that often -rrb- . <sssss> if you are ever in the area , definitely check it out . <sssss> the location is n't ideal ; it 's tucked away in a shopping center off the 101 and next to a rubio 's . <sssss> you might drive by it once or twice , but do n't give up !
MID		when i first moved to the phoenix area , a co-worker directed me to this place . <sssss> i had an amazing club sandwich on the freshest bread possible . <sssss> despite telling everyone how delightful it was and driving by frequently , for years i never went back ! <sssss> fortunately , my husband and i moved relatively close and are lucky enough to be within their delivery area . <sssss> our first delivery consisted of the greek pizza and the big dipper sandwich . <sssss> our second , the big dipper . <sssss> the third , the big dipper . <sssss> seeing a trend here ? <sssss> the big dipper is amazing . <sssss> it 's sliced roast beef , smoked provolone , garlic butter , and au jus all toasty and warm . <sssss> we 've also had their homemade meatballs and garlic toast with mozzerella and marinara . <sssss> the meatballs definately satisfied a craving , and while the sauce really makes the meatballs , i thought the beef was a little dry . <sssss> the garlic toast was highly addictive and we 've ordered it again . <sssss> i would recommend stumpy 's to anyone and everyone . <sssss> sure , it 's tucked away next to my dentist and does n't look like much from the outside -lrb- or inside -rrb- but the food is delicious . <sssss> also , the employees are friendly and look happy . <sssss> the best part is that stumpy 's is a local business !
MID		we 've been here three times now and two times i 've ordered the hot roast beef sandwich . <sssss> to me , it 's a comfort food . <sssss> there 's roast beef , cheese , mustard , and tomatoes . <sssss> nothing fancy -lrb- except i do request havarti -rrb- , but it is so good . <sssss> the husband has had the greek salad , both with and without chicken . <sssss> it 's good - the dressing is n't over powering -lrb- as some places can be -rrb- . <sssss> we 've also tried their triple chocolate cookies - which are delicious . <sssss> there 's seating both inside and out , both being crowded at the lunch time rush . <sssss> the line can be long , but the service is quick and everyone is real nice . <sssss> parking for this place can be tricky , since it is in the kierland shopping area , but it 's really about timing . <sssss> if you are ever in the area , definitely check it out . <sssss> it 's cute and the food is great . <sssss> this is one of our favorite lunch spots !
MID		we 've been here several times since it is right down the street from where the husband and i work . <sssss> we 've also brought the in-laws here , since they really like pei wei . <sssss> i would have to say that this place is similar to pei wei , but with way more varieties and less of a `` chain '' feel . <sssss> when you dine here , you receive a salad with a tasty dressing and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce to start . <sssss> then you have many protein and vegetable options . <sssss> when with the in-laws , we usually order way too much food , but it 's all really tasty and makes good leftovers . <sssss> the house fried rice is delicious - it comes with beef , chicken , and shrimp ! <sssss> the sweet and sour shrimp technically is n't on the menu , but they can bread anything and dunk it in sauce . <sssss> s & s shrimp is one of the father-in-law 's favorite . <sssss> the beef and broccoli is tasty - the broccoli tastes fresh and the beef is really tender . <sssss> the sister-in-law and i really enjoy the beef teppanyaki - which is wide flour noodles with onions and beef . <sssss> the sauce is delicious and again the beef is tender . <sssss> the husband always orders a different dish , never deciding on just one favorite . <sssss> on saturdays , the lunch items are all $ 5 , which is a great deal . <sssss> if you are ever in the area , definitely give flo 's a try ! <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed .
HIG		i never really understood what the big deal was with crepes , but the crepe bar made a believer out of me . <sssss> the menu is basic , but that simplicity also makes it classic . <sssss> there are three sweet crepes - nutella and bananas , cream and berries , and a house special of crème brulee . <sssss> the savory crepes include a burrito and a few others -lrb- sorry , ca n't remember ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> husband and i ordered two berry crepes and a vanilla latte . <sssss> as we waited for our food , we watched the burrito go by and decided we 'd have to come back and give that a try - it looked delicious and enough to split . <sssss> my latte arrived in a black ceramic cup with a foam heart on top , delivered by a smiling employee . <sssss> first sip - heavenly . <sssss> -lrb- one of the better lattes i 've had recently and i 'm a coffee snob . <sssss> -rrb- quickly our crepes followed , looking beautiful on pristine , white plates . <sssss> there were strawberries , blueberries , and blackberries dancing over sweet cream with a singular crepe rolled up and sliced into rolls - might have looked skimpy , but definitely filling . <sssss> husband requested caramel be drizzled over his , adding a sweeter taste to his crepe . <sssss> crepe was light and airy , no crispy edges and just sweet enough . <sssss> the cream and berries were definitely fresh . <sssss> the location is a bit hard to find and for us the drive takes 30 minutes with no traffic . <sssss> committing to that kind of drive time just to get some breakfast food , it 's got ta be good , right ? <sssss> damn straight . <sssss> the inside is a bit sparse , i do n't remember any wall art , but there are plenty of tables and chairs . <sssss> on the steel counter top , instead of a regular cash register , they use an ipad - which gives them cool techie cred . <sssss> you can also see the chef at work , which is nice to see where the food comes from . <sssss> overall , i would definitely recommend this place to take your date , relatives , friends , maybe even strangers - just gather them all up and prepare for deliciousness .
HIG		now , i do n't know about you , but it 's hard to be a fancy lady . <sssss> luckily , i can shop at the fancy fry 's . <sssss> sure i might be in my sweats and i 'll fight you over the last turkey , but at least this place has covered parking and complimentary valet service . <sssss> neither of which i 've used , but it 's the thought that counts . <sssss> this fry 's thinks about me and my needs . <sssss> do i need twenty different types of cheeses ? <sssss> no . <sssss> am i going to buy twenty different types of cheeses ? <sssss> yes . <sssss> fry 's has got my back -lrb- and my wallet -rrb- and i 'm okay with that . <sssss> i love this fry 's . <sssss> you can get all your grocery shopping done here since it has many more items the normal fry 's but all at the same low prices . <sssss> plus , there 's a wine bar , smoothie bar , sushi bar , omelet bar , olive bar , etc. all located within the store . <sssss> i really love their huge cheese selection and can get caught up in the frenzy of delicious cheese and barely notice half my cart is gouda , smoked cheddar , and brie . <sssss> -lrb- this has happened more than once . <sssss> -rrb- i usually only come here when i need to do some serious shopping because i always spend way more than i would at a regular fry 's since there are so many options . <sssss> luckily , i can stock up on essentials and delicious extras . <sssss> this place is an experience and definitely one you should experience at least once . <sssss> even our out of town guests beg to be taken here . <sssss> i know i 'll be back - when i run out of gouda .
LOW		my husband and i have been here several times and we 've even brought my sister-in-law a few times . <sssss> the location is n't the easiest to get in or out of . <sssss> we always have to drive through the entire parking lot -lrb- past target and ross and plenty of pedestrians -rrb- and then finally have to park by claim jumper . <sssss> it is n't too terrible if we are going to eat at claim jumper after the show , but that is n't always the case . <sssss> i wish it was easier to just drive to the theater and park , instead of having to navigate a large parking lot for several other businesses . <sssss> the actual theater is standard compared to other amc theaters . <sssss> however , it seems older and maybe a little dirtier as well . <sssss> -lrb- they always have sticky floors ! <sssss> -rrb- this amc has an imax , which was a nice experience , and the other screens seem pretty big as well . <sssss> overall , i 'd rather go to desert ridge , since it seems newer and cleaner .
MID		we were at a relative 's house and starving , luckily yelp was there to help us locate this place ! <sssss> we came on a sunday , which apparently happy hour is all day . <sssss> however , the bar area was packed , so we decided to pass and sat in the dining area - practically all alone ! <sssss> it was nice , since we got to choose where we wanted to sit and our waiter was really friendly and attentive . <sssss> the husband ordered the short ribs and i ordered the steak sandwich . <sssss> the short ribs were good , not the best , but the root vegetables with them were delicious . <sssss> my steak sandwich was really good . <sssss> it was messy , but all tasty sandwiches are messy ! <sssss> the steak had a strong flavor , some sort of spice or rub . <sssss> the french fries that came with the meal were superb . <sssss> they were crunchy and salty - just the way i like them . <sssss> we took a look at the dessert menu and really wanted to order something , but had to pass . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back to try happy hour and the dessert menu !
MID		i really like this whole foods market . <sssss> they have everything a regular grocery store has plus much , much more . <sssss> there 's a grill inside , a tiny restaurant , an asian food bistro , a pizza counter , and the list goes on . <sssss> luckily , this location is close to our work and we have frequented it many times for lunch . <sssss> if you are ever in the area , definiately stop on by as you 'll find everything you need and go home with items you did n't need but definiately wanted !
LOW		i 've been to a few different paradise bakeries before and this one is no different . <sssss> you can either call ahead or wait in line . <sssss> sometimes , waiting in line is worth it as there 's this really sweet lady who walks around handing out fresh from the oven cookies . <sssss> i normally order a sandwich -lrb- bacon turkey bravo -rrb- but their soups and salads are good too . <sssss> i like their french onion soup the best and the roll that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment . <sssss> the food is consistently good and the employees are generally friendly and accommodating . <sssss> the one thing i do n't like is the location . <sssss> sure , it 's close to work and is perfect for lunch , but the parking is atrocious . <sssss> it 's difficult to get in , it 's difficult to get out , and good luck finding a space ! <sssss> i 'd recommend coming either before or after the lunch rush .
MID		this is the first whole foods i 'd ever actually shopped at . <sssss> granted , i do n't do my `` staples '' shopping here , but for the occasional needs it 's a quick and easy stop . <sssss> plus , the 365 brand -lrb- the whole food 's brand -rrb- is relatively inexpensive and delicious . <sssss> i like that it 's close to work , but unfortunately they do n't open until 8am . <sssss> which is a bummer because i love their pineapple , mango , banana , coconut water , and spinach smoothies for breakfast ! <sssss> also , on wednesdays , the hot foods are $ 5.99 / lb , which is a good deal for breakfast foods or lunch . <sssss> the store is clean and well laid out . <sssss> the location is great and i especially love food truck thursdays ! <sssss> every third thursday of the month , a group of food trucks descend upon the parking lot and serve up delicious eats and treats . <sssss> i love it !
MID		i 've been to the ipic twice now - once with family to see `` jack reacher '' and the second time for a yelp event to see `` jobs '' . <sssss> both experiences were one of a kind and a unique movie experience . <sssss> the ipic is located in the heart of the scottsdale quarter . <sssss> it is upstairs , so look for the stairs/escalator going up near true foods . <sssss> once on the second level , it is next to tanzy . <sssss> the actual ipic has a bar called salt and on the other end , it is connected to tanzy . <sssss> it 's nice that you can get a drink or some food before the movie , then once inside you can order off the menu for more drinks/food . <sssss> premium seating is the way to go - you get a pillow , a blanket , and the seat is super plush/comfy and reclines . <sssss> this is the movie theater you want to go to for a 3 hour movie or when your date insists on a movie you do n't want to see -lrb- you can take a nap ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i would highly recommend this theater in these types of situations . <sssss> otherwise , it can be a little pricey . <sssss> -lrb- regular seating is $ 18 and premium is $ 21 or $ 25 . <sssss> -rrb- if you sign up with them as a member , you can get preferred seating and a slight discount . <sssss> overall , seeing a movie at the ipic is something you have to do at least once !
HIG		went to trader joe 's . <sssss> came back with a shit-ton of candy . <sssss> `` how ? '' <sssss> you may ask . <sssss> well , let me tell you . <sssss> they have these things called sea salt butterscotch caramels -lrb- dipped in decadent dark chocolate -rrb- . <sssss> these things are crack . <sssss> pure and simple . <sssss> you grab one or two and pop them in your mouth . <sssss> suddenly the entire bag is gone and you 're left crying for more . <sssss> next trip you buy two bags . <sssss> well , then two bags are suddenly empty and you need to go back and buy more . <sssss> it 's a vicious cycle . <sssss> luckily , they have these things called fruits and vegetables to keep you healthy in-between all the candy devouring . <sssss> their produce selection is pretty good and i really like all the frozen items they have . <sssss> the store seems rather small -lrb- compared to other grocers -rrb- because they only carry the good stuff . <sssss> checkout is rather quick and simple , but be careful , they have valrhona chocolate begging for a good home . <sssss> -lrb- yep , two candy bars ... in my belly . <sssss> -rrb-
HIG		i ca n't believe i have n't reviewed this place yet . <sssss> the husband and i have been coming here for years now and it is still one of our favorite burger places . <sssss> the delux burger is just fantastic with caramelized onions , blue cheese , and arugula . <sssss> we always order medium-rare and it is always perfect . <sssss> the burger is huge - we usually split and then order a basket of mixed fries . <sssss> their sweet potato fries are my favorite . <sssss> not a big fan of the regular fries , but the husband likes them . <sssss> the fries come with some aioli sauce which is addictive . <sssss> the husband also loves their lobster bisque soup and they make a pretty good chocolate malt shake . <sssss> definitely check this place out if you are ever in the area ! <sssss> if you do n't order dessert here , you can always head over to gelato spot for dessert !
LOW		my husband and i used to love the grind until our experience a few saturdays ago . <sssss> a friend was in town and we could n't decide if we should go to delux burger -lrb- my choice -rrb- or the grind -lrb- husband 's choice -rrb- . <sssss> we all regret going to the grind . <sssss> first , the wait was over 20 minutes . <sssss> i understand this can happen anywhere , especially on a saturday evening . <sssss> i was n't real upset over this , but it was definitely in the back of my mind . <sssss> when we were finally seated , our waiter was prompt to ask if he could get us anything to drink . <sssss> water 's all around , except my husband ordered a soda . <sssss> now , the waiter was very prompt in refilling my husband 's soda all night but not my water . <sssss> e for effort ? <sssss> when we were ready to order , they seemed to be out of a lot of items . <sssss> we wanted an order of onion rings - they were out . <sssss> a mushroom burger - out of mushrooms . <sssss> finally , i asked if they could make me a chocolate malt shake . <sssss> the waiter looked at me funny and said , he `` thinks so , but it would be a long wait , is that ok ? '' <sssss> sure , why not . <sssss> well , he was n't kidding . <sssss> everyone 's food came before my chocolate shake came . <sssss> yes , it was just chocolate - no malt in sight . <sssss> -lrb- side note : the shake was pretty bad . <sssss> it was all melty - not thick and creamy like most . <sssss> also , the chocolate flavor was off . <sssss> i could have gone next door to baskin robbins and gotten a much better shake that was less expensive . <sssss> -rrb- at this point , i 'm really regretting the decision to come here . <sssss> my husband was regretting it a few hours later when he was violently ill and throwing up his meal . <sssss> all i can say is that i am so glad i did n't eat a burger here that night !
MID		i stopped here once for breakfast and it was delicious . <sssss> it was before 8am on a weekday and the place was empty . <sssss> the cook/owner was extremely nice and helped me to decide what would travel best on my way to work . <sssss> i ordered the organic hot breakfast cereal -lrb- basically oatmeal -rrb- with pecans and a hot chocolate . <sssss> mmm . <sssss> both items were delicious and made quickly . <sssss> they also travelled well ! <sssss> the location is great , it 's both close to the asu campus and the highway , so it 's really easy to get to . <sssss> i just wish we lived closer so we could come here more often to try their other breakfast items . <sssss> i 've heard great things about their bakery items as well and ca n't wait to try !
HIG		this is one of the first places i ever tried when i first moved to the valley in 2005 and it is still one of my favorite places to get a sweet treat . <sssss> i have taken numerous friends and family here to try their gelato and experience a little bit of heaven . <sssss> the gelato is that good ! <sssss> my favorite is their pokett coffee as it tastes just as strong as real coffee but sweet and creamy . <sssss> mmm . <sssss> it 's great alone , as a shake , or in a cone . <sssss> i 've also had it as a cake ! <sssss> the gelato spot makes great special occasion cakes . <sssss> you can choose 1 or 2 flavors and they come out great . <sssss> you 'll definitely impress if you bring one of these ! <sssss> the location is great as well . <sssss> after finishing up a great meal at delux burger , head over to gelato spot . <sssss> -lrb- i 've never had dessert at delux burger because the gelato spot is that tempting ! <sssss> -rrb- definitely give the gelato spot a try or try any of their other locations . <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed .
LOW		i stopped here after seeing on their online menu the `` over easy ice '' - cold brewed coffee with cinnamon & cardamom , mixed with sweetened condensed milk & mint . <sssss> i was on a thai coffee kick and thought this would be similar -lrb- having condensed milk -rrb- . <sssss> i decided to order to go , since i was on my way to work and lucky i did because the entire place was packed for breakfast . <sssss> unfortunately , the iced coffee was a huge disappointment . <sssss> i 'm not sure if it was because i ordered it to go or if the waiter was new and did n't know how to make it . <sssss> i watched him get iced coffee , put half and half in it and then call it complete . <sssss> there was no condensed milk used at all and i could n't taste the cardamom or mint . <sssss> the sourdough toast i ordered was good , nice thick slices and tasted homemade . <sssss> i also liked that they gave me some jam . <sssss> it 's close to work , so i 'll have to come back and do a sit down meal to get the whole experience .
MID		i have n't flown in 5 or 6 years and was n't really looking forward to experiencing the `` joy '' that is an airport . <sssss> i 've always heard you have to be at the airport two hours in advance and with our flight being at 6:30 am that means being there are 4:30 am . <sssss> luckily , the traffic at this hour was minimal and getting in was a breeze . <sssss> additionally , the airport seemed pretty dead . <sssss> not too many other flyers going at this hour on a friday morning . <sssss> we were able to go through the full body scanners relatively quickly and then wait around for our plane . <sssss> -lrb- we headed on over to la grand orange - see review : http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-phoenix#hrid:9e12rvbuqnpzy0zgfq2mog -rrb- finding our gate was easy , but seemed to be the last gate for section c . <sssss> there was plenty of seating and the wait was n't too terrible . <sssss> we boarded on time and took off . <sssss> i would recommend getting a direct flight , as ours was not and the wait became an extended 3 hour stay . <sssss> the return flight was just as easy breezy . <sssss> we landed on time , i was able to get out of the plane quickly , and then i easily made it to the baggage area to claim my luggage . <sssss> my ride was waiting outside to pick me up , so we were on our way . <sssss> overall , it was a good experience .
HIG		i absolutely love duck & decanter . <sssss> their sandwiches are always fresh and delicious . <sssss> i especially like that you can build your own sandwich . <sssss> i usually go for a turkey , bacon , and avocado sandwich on wheat bread . <sssss> can you say yum ?! <sssss> the bacon especially , since it is huge and thick - i 'm pretty sure it 's prosciutto , 'cause this ai n't no regular bacon . <sssss> i always order this sandwich and my husband always wants a bite or half the sandwich . <sssss> -lrb- he usually orders the genova sandwich . <sssss> -rrb- it 's definitely a sandwich you could share , but only grudgingly . <sssss> the store itself is really nice to browse and find specialty chocolates or treats while you wait for your sandwich . <sssss> i 'm always tempted to buy the fancy chocolate bars - there 's too many to choose from ! <sssss> it 's nice that they carry local product and other items . <sssss> there 's plenty of room to sit , whether it 's upstairs or outside on the patio . <sssss> the patio is fantastic , especially when there 's live music . <sssss> we love coming here on the weekend to sit back and relax . <sssss> if you love sandwiches , you should definitely stop by duck & decanter . <sssss> this is one of the best sandwich places in phoenix !
MID		i 've been here a few times and more recently came to see a preview of the movie `` stoker '' . <sssss> the location is nice - tucked away off the main road but still close enough to the mall and plenty of parking . <sssss> the inside is on the small side , but this is a more intimate/indie experience . <sssss> there are only a few screens and the lobby is tiny . <sssss> the room we sat in was also on the smaller side - probably could only fit + / - 200 people ? <sssss> the screen was smaller as well . <sssss> it definitely is a difference experience than other theaters . <sssss> also , the back door kept squeaking and groaning as people went in and out of the theater -lrb- totally ruined the movie experience -rrb- . <sssss> while this harkins is smaller and more intimate , it is the perfect venue for indie films . <sssss> anytime a small release film comes out , this is the place to go see it .
LOW		i 've been to donovan 's three times now and each time the food has been good , but nothing spectacular . <sssss> i like the location and the inside is nicely decorated . <sssss> the wait staff has been friendly every time i 've been as well . <sssss> the first time i came with a friend in celebration of his recent promotion . <sssss> we started with a caesar salad and i ordered the mixed grill - a petit filet with shrimp scampi . <sssss> my friend ordered a filet as well . <sssss> when my filet came out , it was n't as well done as i used to like it , so i had to send it back . <sssss> however , they brought out a delicious orange sorbet for me to enjoy while they cooked my steak . <sssss> -lrb- very nice ! <sssss> -rrb- for dessert , we enjoyed two shots of espresso . <sssss> overall , i enjoyed my meal and it was a fun experience . <sssss> the second time i brought my husband for his birthday dinner . <sssss> i started the night with a mojito in the bar while we waited for our table . <sssss> arriving at our table , my husband ordered the giant shrimp cocktail . <sssss> i 'm not much for cold shrimp , but my husband liked it . <sssss> for dinner , my husband the peppercorn filet and i had a small filet . <sssss> our meat was good and came out perfectly medium rare . <sssss> since it was my husband 's birthday , the staff brought out a complimentary crème brulee . <sssss> this was standard brulee - nothing exotic . <sssss> i enjoyed my meal , but my husband was n't too impressed . <sssss> the third time i came for work as part of our party planning . <sssss> donovan 's hosts private parties and once a year has a complimentary tasting for party planners . <sssss> my company at the time was looking into hosting their party at donovan 's , so i went to try the selection and report back . <sssss> i enjoyed their caesar salad , mini steak sandwiches , and cheese/vegetable selections . <sssss> overall , donovan 's is a nice experience and can set a good impression . <sssss> the food is pretty good , but i 've had better steaks at the same or lower price . <sssss> if you can go during happy hour or when they are having a special , i 'd recommend it .
MID		after some shopping , my husband spotted this place and i remember looking at them on yelp . <sssss> i recalled they had a good happy hour . <sssss> decision made , we sauntered in . <sssss> i asked the hostess if they were still having happy hour and she said it went until 7pm and was only in the bar . <sssss> we spotted a lonely bar table and sat there . <sssss> our waitress was quick to arrive and take our drink order . <sssss> during monday 's happy hour , it 's margarita monday , so the larger sized margaritas are $ 5 . <sssss> -lrb- smaller sized ones are $ 3 . <sssss> -rrb- margaritas can be any number of flavors - mango , strawberry , etc. . <sssss> i asked if they had coconut but unfortunately not . <sssss> i decided to go with a house margarita on the rocks . <sssss> my husband went with blended . <sssss> our drinks arrived quickly and in a large glass . <sssss> -lrb- the glasses reminded me of the heavy margarita glasses that chili 's uses . <sssss> -rrb- for a house margarita , the drink was really good and really strong on the tequila . <sssss> wowza , these were some strong drinks . <sssss> -lrb- even the blended drink . <sssss> i was totally thinking premade slushie machine but i seriously think they made the drink then threw it in a blender . <sssss> -rrb- during happy hour , the appetizers and tacos are half price . <sssss> the appetizers include flatbread , nachos , ceviche , etc. . <sssss> we decided on the shrimp flatbread and chicken tacos . <sssss> the flatbread came out on a long rectangular board and three tacos to a plate . <sssss> the flatbread was good but really it was on square crackers - kind of like matzo . <sssss> i kept joking it should be called shrimp crackers -lrb- totally the tequila talking -rrb- . <sssss> the chicken tacos were good too with a huge slice of avocado on them . <sssss> when the tacos ran out , my husband decided to order fish tacos -lrb- mahi mahi -rrb- . <sssss> these came out quickly and were delicious as well . <sssss> when the flatbread and tacos were gone , our waitress asked if we had room for dessert . <sssss> my husband inquired which of the desserts were really good - he could n't decide between the flan , brownie , or apple pie . <sssss> our waitress said the apple pie was surprisingly delicious and one of their most popular desserts . <sssss> how could we resist ? <sssss> the dessert comes out with several dishes . <sssss> there 's a huge cast iron plate that is scorching hot and this is where the brandy butter sauce is poured upon . <sssss> as this sizzles and cooks up , the apple pie is placed in the butter , and then ice cream is dropped on top . <sssss> as a non-apple pie lover , this was pretty good . <sssss> i enjoyed the brandy butter sauce and ice cream the most , they tasted great together . <sssss> unfortunately , our eyes were much larger than our stomachs and we could n't finish this dessert . <sssss> we left full , satisfied , and happy . <sssss> i would definitely recommend coming here for happy hour . <sssss> the food and drinks were a great price and everything was tasty . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back .
LOW		every thursday night , from 6pm to close , they have a special called `` date night '' . <sssss> you and your date can order any 1 appetizer -lrb- choose from about 6 appetizers -rrb- to share , then each person gets a salad , and then you can order any one pizza off the menu to split . <sssss> all of this for $ 20 - it 's a fantastic deal ! <sssss> needless to say , we 've been here a few times . <sssss> we 've tried all the appetizers -lrb- french fries , fried calamari , tempura green beans , and 1/2 order of caprese -rrb- and while none are really my favorite , the husband likes the calamari the best . <sssss> our favorite salad is the strawberry gorganzola which has a nice balsamic vinaigrette and walnuts . <sssss> we have n't tried any of the other salads , but they look good . <sssss> our favorite pizza to order is the mushroom pizza with pancetta and green onions . <sssss> then , for dessert , we usually order the pizzookie -lrb- pizza cookie ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> you can order it in 6 '' or 8 '' and it comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and caramel/chocolate drizzle . <sssss> we always save room for this delicious treat and if it 's on the menu , we are all over it !
HIG		the first time i ever had a pasty was in michigan when i was 10 years old . <sssss> my grandparents bought them at the grocery store premade - all we had to do was warm them up in the oven . <sssss> when cornish pasty co. announced they were going to open in tempe back in 2005 , i was ecstatic and for good reasons - it was love at first bite . <sssss> since 2005 , i 've tried many different pasties and still ca n't decide which my favorite is . <sssss> the oggie is a good standard - it 's what my memory from michigan tastes like only better . <sssss> the pilgrim is amazing - but only when made with turkey . <sssss> honestly , my favorite part is the crust that holds the goodies . <sssss> i do n't care what is inside , as long as that crust is flakey and warm . <sssss> mmm ... one time i ordered a small greek salad and now i have to order it every time i 'm there . <sssss> the dressing they use is this lemony pesto and it is so , so good ... the only down side is that i 'm still tasting it hours later . <sssss> it 's that strong ! <sssss> to finish up , you have got to order the chocolate bread pudding with crème angelias and ice cream . <sssss> the bread is deliciously chocolately but it is also soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside , which i love . <sssss> the husband is n't too crazy about it -lrb- `` bread pudding should n't be crunchy ! '' <sssss> -rrb- , but that means more for me ! <sssss> they have happy hour starting at 3pm , which includes drink specials . <sssss> i 've only ordered a gin and tonic here and as far as i 'm concerned , it 's pretty damn good . <sssss> one time they were out of tonic and they made a special trip to go out and buy some , just so i could have my drink . <sssss> i felt pretty special that night . <sssss> we have been to the location in mesa and the patio is really nice , but the original restaurant has rustic charm . <sssss> whether you are sitting at the bar top or in a corner booth , you can feel the energy of the restaurant and be intimate with your dining partner . <sssss> it 's nice they expanded the restaurant and were still able to keep the same ambiance . <sssss> anytime we are in tempe , this is always one of our stops and a place we frequently take friends . <sssss> if you are ever in the area , definitely stop in !!
MID		as i 've said previously , i love sacks and their sandwiches . <sssss> compared to the downtown version , this location is nice . <sssss> the parking is a little confusing , since it is shared with another restaurant , but at least there is plenty of parking ! <sssss> both outside and inside are pretty cool . <sssss> i 've always called ahead and had my order ready and waiting to be devoured . <sssss> for such a delicious sandwich , the price is great . <sssss> my fav is the symphony - turkey , avocado , and bacon on wheat . <sssss> perfection . <sssss> the employees are really nice as well . <sssss> i like that i can get in and out quickly at this location -lrb- compared to the downtown location -rrb- . <sssss> i just wish there was a sack 's closer to home !
LOW		my husband and i came here for lunch the other day after we had heard some good things from co-workers . <sssss> i feel like this place is trying to be a hip and gourmet burger joint - sort of like delux burger - but falls short . <sssss> the location is decent and i like all the windows . <sssss> the color scheme is blue and there 's plenty of burger artwork inside . <sssss> however , the inside seems a little cramped . <sssss> you definitely have to do some maneuvering to get to a table all the way in the back of the restaurant -lrb- or the restrooms -rrb- . <sssss> there are plenty of tables and a short booth section , but then there are screens than hang from ceiling to floor and that makes it even more difficult to navigate . <sssss> lucky for us , we sat all the way in the back and had to do some fancy dancing to get back there . <sssss> the waitress was nice and attentive . <sssss> she answered any questions i had about the burgers and was quick to take our order . <sssss> they have a lunch special for $ 9.95 . <sssss> this includes a burger -lrb- or sandwich -rrb- , fries , and a drink . <sssss> you have to choose from a list of burgers/sandwiches , but they have a wide variety . <sssss> i thought about getting the chicken or veggie sandwich , but went with the standard classic - cheeseburger . <sssss> i ordered sweet potato fries and since it comes with a drink , received an ice tea . <sssss> my husband ordered almost the same , but got regular fries instead . <sssss> our food came rather quickly and looked good . <sssss> the patty was a little thinner than my husband normally likes , but compared to some places it was decently sized . <sssss> the flavor was good - tasted meaty and no real spices . <sssss> i liked the cheese they used , real cheddar cheese , and i think this was my favorite part of the burger . <sssss> my husband did n't really care for his burger , wishing it had more flavor . <sssss> his fries were okay - nothing special . <sssss> however , i really liked my sweet potato fries , which came with a cinnamon marshmallow sauce . <sssss> the sauce , i did n't really care for . <sssss> it was waaay too sweet and looked unappetizing . <sssss> overall , i do n't know if we 'd come back for lunch , unless we were in the area . <sssss> the happy hour looked decent and i do love an adult milkshake -lrb- or just a chocolate malt ! <sssss> -rrb- so i might come back to try . <sssss> i might not indulge with burgers , but i definitely can try with dessert !
MID		recently i became consumed with the over whelming desire to consume crepes . <sssss> after searching yelp , i came across this place . <sssss> luckily , it 's pretty close to my work so the husband and i had to check it out . <sssss> it 's in a shopping center near a pei wei , which is sort of a turn off , but that does n't detract from the food . <sssss> the husband ordered the chez-vous , which had roasted chicken , sautéed mushrooms , and béchamel sauce while i ordered the brittany -lrb- chicken , tomato , caramelized onions , and crème fraiche -rrb- . <sssss> both came with a side salad , which had a very good dressing . <sssss> i was n't expecting the crepe to be an organic buckwheat crepe , but it was delicious ! <sssss> afterwards , we split the exotic crepe - shredded coconut , melted dark chocolate , and bananas . <sssss> i 'm a sucker for anything coconut , so let 's just say it was amazing . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back !
HIG		i had actually heard about this place from yelp a year ago but only recently got around to trying it . <sssss> it 's close to our house , but out of the way when we are driving to work , which is a real bummer because i want to grab lattes and breakfast here all the time now ! <sssss> 11/21/12 : driving by this place , it could be a little hard to miss the turn , but they have an outside patio and a drive thru that becomes visible once you get closer . <sssss> after debating if i wanted to eat alone outside , i decided to use the drive thru so i could take it home and eat . <sssss> i ordered the new mexico burrito and a medium iced vanilla latte . <sssss> the latte was crafted quickly and i drove forward to wait for the burrito . <sssss> one sip and i immediately knew this latte was amazing . <sssss> i am a coffee snob who ca n't stand bitter coffee/espresso or exceedingly sweet syrups , but this was neither . <sssss> the vanilla flavor was strong , but not too sweet . <sssss> the espresso was n't over powering and mixed well with the milk and vanilla . <sssss> overall , one of the best latte 's i 've had . <sssss> within minutes , my burrito was ready and an employee walked it out to my car . <sssss> once home , i cut the burrito in half , slathered some of the homemade green chili sauce that was included on top , and dug in . <sssss> mmm , it was good . <sssss> i even took a pic and emailed the husband , just to make him jealous ! <sssss> thrilled with my drink and delicious burrito , i promised to take him here next time . <sssss> 12/2/12 : my mother-in-law was in town , so we stopped here for some early morning coffee . <sssss> i ordered an iced vanilla latte , a blueberry muffin , and she ordered a regular coffee . <sssss> again my drink was fantastic and super quick service . <sssss> my mother-in-law enjoyed her coffee and the sip she had from my drink . <sssss> the muffin was delicious as well ! <sssss> overall , this place is truly a gem ! <sssss> it 's small but the décor is nice and welcoming . <sssss> the staff is friendly and the service is quick . <sssss> i 'm really looking forward to going back !
HIG		if i had to pick one latin-fusion restaurant to eat at for the rest of my life , i would choose ticoz . <sssss> they have a great happy hour every day of the week with different drink and food specials . <sssss> i adore their blackberry mojito and their coconut margarita . <sssss> also , their guacamus is my favorite appetizer . <sssss> i could eat it any time of the day . <sssss> normally we order the grilled burrito and have them do a split plate . <sssss> sure , there 's an extra $ 2 charge , but it is totally worth it . <sssss> the husband and i each receive our own burrito -lrb- slightly smaller than the normal sized burrito , which is huge -rrb- and our own coleslaw . <sssss> it is still a lot of food , but so good . <sssss> we 've had a few desserts here , but nothing special . <sssss> all of the staff is super nice and utterly kind . <sssss> we have always been seated promptly and served quickly . <sssss> even when we do take out , the service is impeccable . <sssss> the inside is hip and modern with a relaxed feel and the patio is great . <sssss> the bathrooms could use an update , but that 's not going to stop me from coming here . <sssss> if you are ever in the area , i would highly recommend going here .
MID		this shopping center is nuts . <sssss> coming off the loop 101 , you have to fight to be in the farthest right lane and pass the ginormous fry 's shopping center and health center . <sssss> then when turning into this shopping center , you have to weave around pedestrians , cars idling for the liquor shop , and random shopping carts lurking . <sssss> trying to find parking is a nightmare . <sssss> once you are done shopping , the act of trying to get out of the shopping center/parking lot is even more stressful . <sssss> unfortunately , this is the closest sprouts to work . <sssss> i would come here more often if it for the stress of trying to get in/out . <sssss> the actual store is really nice . <sssss> it 's large and clean . <sssss> they have great prices on produce , so that is why i go . <sssss> i mean $ 0.99 blueberries ? <sssss> i guess i 'd fight traffic for that .
MID		salt is the bar inside ipic , so you can get your pre-movie drink on . <sssss> let me just say , the drinks are the best part ! <sssss> all cocktails at salt are made with liquid nitrogen . <sssss> the mixes are premade , so the bartender pours the mix/liquor into a metal bowl , picks up a large canister of liquid nitrogen and starts creating magic . <sssss> fog steams out of the bowl and tiny pieces of cocktail goodness jump out like little pieces of frozen hail . <sssss> then the bartender takes a whisk and whisks the drink into a frozen concoction . <sssss> the consistency is like a frozen blended drink , but way better since no ice is involved . <sssss> currently , there are three specialty cocktails on the menu . <sssss> one is made with prickly pear , one is pineapple and jalapeno , and then my favorite - the bangkok monkey . <sssss> this one is like a pina colada - pineapple , passion fruit , and rum . <sssss> so , so , so good ! <sssss> these drinks pack a wallop - so strong that one was enough to get me tipsy . <sssss> they are also a little pricey - $ 15 per drink . <sssss> they are very labor intensive , a work of love , so i can understand that . <sssss> overall , i 'd come back for a special treat !
MID		i went to yelp 's cocktail society at j & g steakhouse a few months ago and raved to the husband about how amazing it was , so i promised to take him here for his birthday . <sssss> it was a great birthday ! <sssss> we sat on the patio , which overlooked an amazing view , and got to cozy up next to each other . <sssss> our waiter was friendly but did n't hoover and let us enjoy our time together . <sssss> the food was fantastic . <sssss> we got the brussel sprouts to share then i ordered the filet and the husband got the ribeye . <sssss> both were super tender and flavorful . <sssss> -lrb- husband said one of the best he 's had recently . <sssss> -rrb- for desert we ordered the tiramisu and j & g also brought out a special birthday treat - a chocolate lava cake . <sssss> both sweets were tasty , but the tiramisu had frozen crystals inside - like it was frozen then thawed . <sssss> overall , we had a good time and will be back .
HIG		good food in a gas station ? <sssss> it 's true . <sssss> my husband stopped by here for lunch last week and brought back this amazing barbeque pork sandwich with some of the best shoestring fries i 've ever had . <sssss> one bite and i was hooked . <sssss> since then we have been here 2 times and both times the service has been fast and the food delicious . <sssss> the food is fresh and tasty - for both breakfast and lunch . <sssss> my husband and i split a breakfast wrap and this was no ordinary wrap . <sssss> whole wheat tortilla stuffed with scrambled eggs , grilled peppers and onions , jalapeno bacon and cheddar cheese - definitely enough food for two . <sssss> the second time we went for lunch my husband got the special of the day , fried catfish . <sssss> my husband devoured it . <sssss> i tried a bite and it was really good - it was n't fishy tasting and the plating looked really nice . <sssss> i got the pulled pork sandwich with shoestring fries which came in a basket . <sssss> i 'd prefer a plate , but this did n't affect the taste ! <sssss> all their meats are slow smoked and have this great `` campfire '' taste . <sssss> all items come sans barbeque because they have their own barbeque bar ! <sssss> you can pick and choose which sauces you want to use . <sssss> i recommend the low country bbq -lrb- has bacon and peppers -rrb- and the texas chipotle . <sssss> both are a little sweet but super addictive . <sssss> even the decor inside is nice and simple . <sssss> i would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area or just want to try some new bbq .
HIG		the husband and i love this place . <sssss> we have been coming here ever since we moved to the neighborhood and both the food and service is consistently amazing . <sssss> we have tried most of the breakfast menu but have n't dived into the lunch menu . <sssss> our favorite is the gouda brizza -lrb- breakfast pizza -rrb- - smoked gouda , bacon , hollandaise sauce , and scrambled eggs . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> on lazy weekends , we order this to go and enjoy back at our place . <sssss> when we dine in , it 's a mix . <sssss> their costa breakfast burrito is delicious - something the husband orders frequently . <sssss> i really like their mushroom and bacon omelet , but i also enjoy their `` two eggs anyway '' meal . <sssss> i normally get scrambled eggs , bacon , pancakes , and fruit -lrb- instead of potatoes -rrb- . <sssss> super delicious and filling . <sssss> another favorite are the biscuits and gravy . <sssss> now this is amazing ! <sssss> the biscuits are super soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside . <sssss> they just melt in your mouth ! <sssss> the gravy is the perfect accompaniment . <sssss> it 's thick and filled with sausage . <sssss> these are some of the best b & g s i 've had ! <sssss> the best part is how inexpensive yet utterly delicious they are ! <sssss> i love that it 's a local place that uses local food . <sssss> everything is fresh and the staff is outstanding . <sssss> we 've taken both sets of parents here as well as friends . <sssss> this is definitely the go-to breakfast place . <sssss> if you are ever in the area , you should definitely check it out !
MID		a co-worker had mentioned this place so we decided to check it out . <sssss> it 's pretty close to work , so we have been here both for lunch and dinner . <sssss> we 've tried numerous items off the menu , so i 'll highlight what we liked the best . <sssss> - guacamole sol : avocado , mango , goat cheese , and pepitas . <sssss> this is delicious but it 's really unnecessary . <sssss> do n't get me wrong - i love guacamole but the extras do n't really add to it . <sssss> i 'd be fine with their naked guacamole . <sssss> - coconut calamari : calamari steak with panko-breading and coconut . <sssss> this is delicious ! <sssss> the calamari is huge and super tender . <sssss> we 've ordered this a few times . <sssss> - spicy chicken & bacon salad : walnuts , avocado , cherry tomatoes ... mmm . <sssss> this salad was delicious ! <sssss> the chicken was n't too spicy and it was very moist and tender . <sssss> i 'd definitely order this again . <sssss> - taco vampiro : double tortilla stuffed with melted cheese and carne asada . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> little overboard , honestly , who needs 2 tortillas that are stuffed with cheese ? <sssss> but really good . <sssss> - ensenada style fish tacos : your basic fish tacos . <sssss> we ordered the red rice with this and the red rice is delicious . <sssss> it 's flavorful - definitely not bland like some restaurant 's rice . <sssss> - carnitas street tacos : the pork was super moist and tender . <sssss> while waiting for your food , they bring out salsa , black bean dip , and chips . <sssss> all are delicious . <sssss> the location is pretty easy to get in and out of - as long as there is parking in the parking structure next door . <sssss> once you park , the actual restaurant is really close . <sssss> we 've never had to wait for a table , which is nice . <sssss> the hostess and waiters are extremely nice and helpful . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back !
MID		after shopping at fry 's , my husband and i decided to grab dinner at portillo 's . <sssss> we had never been to a portillo 's previously and wanted to try it . <sssss> we contemplated parking and going in or using the drive-thru . <sssss> we saw several employees standing outside with headsets and such ; we were concerned something was wrong with the telecom system that most drive-thru places use . <sssss> we decided to chance it and use the drive-thru . <sssss> when we pulled up , a friendly employee greeted us and asked to take our order . <sssss> we explained that this was our first time , so she handed us two menus . <sssss> i decided to get the chili cheese dog and my husband decided on the maxwell street style polish dog . <sssss> we both decided on onion rings . <sssss> the employee told us to drive around and pay at the second window . <sssss> again , there were several employees outside waiting to take our money and hand us our food . <sssss> they were all very friendly so i asked why they were standing outside . <sssss> apparently this is what they do ! <sssss> all day , every day - unless it 's really busy and not efficient to do so . <sssss> call me crazy , but this was totally bizarre to me . <sssss> it was a very hot day , but az can get scorching during the summer . <sssss> let 's hope they are inside on those days ! <sssss> our food was prepared quickly and we took it home to enjoy . <sssss> my chili cheese dog was really good - everything was flavorful and the bun was soft . <sssss> i had a bite of my husband 's and it was really good too ! <sssss> i could n't decide which i liked better . <sssss> the onion rings were good but i probably would n't order them again . <sssss> -lrb- they had more bread than onion - the ratio was off . <sssss> -rrb- looking through the menu more closely , they have a lot of items to choose from . <sssss> i 'll definately be back to try more !
MID		the herb box is one tasty place . <sssss> i 've been to this location -lrb- and the downtown scottsdale location -rrb- a few times now , every time trying something new . <sssss> the inside is really cute - i love the wall décor and overall feel/look of the place . <sssss> there are plenty of tables inside , including a bar and a to-go station . <sssss> for nice weather days , the patio is fantastic as well . <sssss> of all the items tried , i really love their wraps with sweet potato chips . <sssss> my favorite is the turkey-avocado wrap with bacon and pepperjack cheese . <sssss> their short rib tacos were delicious and so was their salad with grilled garlic shrimp . <sssss> additionally , i 've had their kobe burger . <sssss> the burger itself was delicious , but i 'll have to remember that medium-rare means rare -lrb- way too rare -rrb- . <sssss> i 've noticed that all the items are huge and definitely could be split with a dining partner or saved for later . <sssss> do n't forget their dessert selection - it varies seasonally . <sssss> or if you are in a rush , check out the dessert case . <sssss> i took a friend for birthday lunch and they gave her a delicious birthday cupcake - on the house . <sssss> it was the perfect touch and a great way to end the meal . <sssss> if you are looking for a great place to take someone for lunch - whether it 's a date , group lunch , or work related - i 'd definitely recommend herb box . <sssss> they have a wide selection for picky or indecisive eaters and the location/d écor makes a great impression . <sssss> definitely check it out !
MID		my husband and i have been here several times and even took the in-laws once . <sssss> -lrb- for happy hour $ 2.99 margaritas that are delicious and not watered down . <sssss> -rrb- also , their tacos ! <sssss> whether it is fish , pork , or steak - the tacos are so , so good . <sssss> plus , they are only $ 5 during happy hour , which is a steal . <sssss> normally we 'd order the obama burrito with red sauce to split . <sssss> definitely enough to share , but you 'll probably want to growl at anyone who tries to take a bite from your plate . <sssss> unfortunately , padre 's closed doors in june and will be sorely missed .
LOW		this review is for the new location in scottsdale . <sssss> it was saturday afternoon and i was starting to get hangry . <sssss> -lrb- you know , hungry and angry . <sssss> -rrb- i could n't decide where i wanted to eat and that meant my poor husband had to make a decision . <sssss> driving around downtown scottsdale , my husband saw a new restaurant with bright colors and decided that would be the place . <sssss> unfortunately , there was n't any parking out front , so he drove around back . <sssss> after we got out of the car , he saw au petit four and knowing that i love french food , decided to take me here . <sssss> we did n't look at the menu posted outside , just walked right in and were slightly confused . <sssss> the space is rather large and sectioned off into two areas - a bakery on one side and a restaurant on the other . <sssss> a man and a woman were behind a counter in the restaurant side and asked if we wanted to sit down and dine . <sssss> my husband said yes and we were seated in the completely empty dining section . <sssss> in the entire building , it was just the two employees and my husband and me . <sssss> -lrb- awkward ... -rrb- there was plenty of seating and open space . <sssss> the walls were brown brick with pictures of paris scattering the walls willy-nilly and all tables were covered with plastic red and white checkered table cloths . <sssss> i did n't particularly care for the table cloths because they stuck to my legs . <sssss> after looking at the menu , i shook my head at my husband saying i was n't sure what i wanted to eat . <sssss> after much indecision -lrb- the poor waitress had to come back a few times -rrb- i finally decided on the prosciutto sandwich and my husband ordered a savory crepe . <sssss> while waiting for our food , i went to the bathroom . <sssss> it was down the long entrance hall , passing by several open doors to the kitchen/storage closets . <sssss> the bathroom was in dire need of some cleaning and restocking -lrb- barely any soap and i used the last paper towel -rrb- . <sssss> when i got back to our table , it was only a few short minutes before my sandwich arrived and shortly after the crepe . <sssss> my sandwich came with the option of salad , chips , or pasta salad . <sssss> i went with salad . <sssss> the salad was basically mixed greens and salad dressing on the side . <sssss> -lrb- the salad dressing was good , but i expected tomatoes or something else on the salad . <sssss> -rrb- the sandwich itself was really good . <sssss> the prosciutto was thickly sliced with even larger slices/hunks of slightly melted brie . <sssss> there was also pesto spread , tomatoes , and lettuce . <sssss> overall , i loved my sandwich . <sssss> the bread was fresh and really hit the spot . <sssss> my husband said he liked he crepe , but he only ate half of it . <sssss> i tried a bite and preferred my sandwich much more . <sssss> overall , the only good thing in the entire experience was my sandwich . <sssss> the fact that there were n't any other diners during lunch , the bathroom was lacking , and the `` just ok '' crepe , i ca n't say that i will be back . <sssss> there are plenty of other places to get fantastic crepes and fantastic sandwiches . <sssss> perhaps their desserts are amazing ?
MID		this place has been open for almost two years and my husband and i have finally dinned here ! <sssss> this place used to be an italian spot that shut down and was quickly replaced by thirteenth north . <sssss> it 's close to home but for some reason we kept passing it up . <sssss> what a mistake ! <sssss> i was starving the other night and wanted to eat somewhere close , so my husband suggested we finally give this a try . <sssss> the parking lot is rather small and appeared to be packed , but luckily we found a spot . <sssss> there 's some nice patio dining out front -lrb- albeit a bit small -rrb- and the inside is on the small side too . <sssss> however , this place was packed ! <sssss> the bar was full and there were only a few tables unoccupied . <sssss> everyone seemed to be in a good mood too . <sssss> our hostess was quick to seat us and it seemed forever for our waitress to make an appearance , but when she did she automatically brought us waters . <sssss> we were ready to order by then and once we ordered our salads appeared almost immediately . <sssss> they were house salads , but i got mine with blue cheese and my husband picked ranch . <sssss> both of us really liked the salads ! <sssss> they were rather large with fresh ingredients that included tomatoes , cucumbers , and had large parmesan slices . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> shortly after we finished our salads , our meals came . <sssss> i ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes and my husband chose the filet . <sssss> the mashed potatoes and vegetables were delicious . <sssss> i really enjoyed the mashed potatoes - they had scallions and cheese . <sssss> i normally do n't enjoy them that much at restaurants but i brought my left overs home for dinner the next night - they were that good ! <sssss> unfortunately , the ribeye was a letdown . <sssss> sure it was 14oz and covered the plate , but it was really thin and extremely fatty . <sssss> i 've had ribeyes at other restaurants where the steak is the same 14oz , but it is much thicker . <sssss> i really prefer the thicker cut , even if it appears to be a smaller portion . <sssss> however , my husband 's filet was really good . <sssss> it was thick and juicy . <sssss> the seasoning on both steaks were good , but needed a little salt . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back to try some of the other menu offerings .
LOW		3.5 stars * we had jason 's deli catered at a work luncheon and i was very impressed with the food . <sssss> we had a fruit platter , a sandwich tray , and a salad . <sssss> it was really good , so i decided to try jason 's deli for lunch . <sssss> i 've been to the shea location twice now . <sssss> the first time , i ordered to-go at the counter . <sssss> they were quick to take my order and had it out to me within 10-15 minutes . <sssss> -lrb- i ordered the zucchini grillini - roasted zucchini , muenster , spinach , red onions , tomatoes , olives , red pepper hummus all toasted on whole grain bread . <sssss> super delicious ! <sssss> sandwiches come with a side of chips , fresh fruit , or steamed veggies . <sssss> -rrb- the second time , i called in an order for pick-up . <sssss> -lrb- one chicken caesar salad , one nutty mixed-up salad , and a zucchini grillini with a cup of soup . <sssss> -rrb- they said it would be ready in 15 minutes , so i drove down to pick-up the meal . <sssss> when i arrived , they were n't too busy but my order was not ready . <sssss> i paid for my food and waited . <sssss> and waited . <sssss> and waited some more . <sssss> several other customers came in , ordered to go and left before my food was ready . <sssss> after this happened twice , i asked one of the employees where my food was . <sssss> it had n't even been started ! <sssss> finally , thirty -lrb- 30 ! <sssss> -rrb- minutes after paying they said my food should be ready shortly . <sssss> i waited another 10 minutes before i finally received my food . <sssss> needless to say , i was very upset . <sssss> food was promised to be ready within 15 minutes of phone order , but was n't actually ready until an hour later . <sssss> they did give me some free cookies , and while that was nice , i really would have preferred to have my food ready when promised . <sssss> -lrb- i can get very angry when i am hungry - the `` hangry '' phenomenon . <sssss> -rrb- of the three employees i interacted with , only one of them apologized profusely -lrb- the employee actually making the sandwiches -rrb- . <sssss> that was appreciated as well . <sssss> while the food is delicious , i 'm torn on returning . <sssss> from my experience , orders that are placed at the counter to-go are made quickly but phone orders somehow get lost in the shuffle . <sssss> the location is n't close enough that i can go frequently , so having to wait any extra amount of time pushes the limits of my lunch hour . <sssss> * food is definitely 4 star , but service/wait time is 3 stars . <sssss> if i go again , this may tip the scales . <sssss> we 'll see !
HIG		if you know me , you might know that i sometimes i call places by their incorrect name . <sssss> this is one of those places . <sssss> for months , i referred to this place as lee lee 's ice cream . <sssss> finally , my husband had to correct me -lrb- which means make fun of me -rrb- . <sssss> no matter the name , this place has fantastic ice cream ! <sssss> my husband and i have stopped here numerous times for an after dinner treat and taken friends several times . <sssss> i love that they have a rotating ice cream selection and let you sample the different flavors . <sssss> every flavor i 've had is creamy and sweet with a hint of the infused liquor . <sssss> nothing too strong , but compliments the other flavors . <sssss> i have to admit , the black russian with kahlua is my favorite . <sssss> luckily , they even have non-alcoholic ice cream if you bring the kiddies . <sssss> if you 're tired of gelato or frozen yogurt and want to try something new , definitely stop by this place for a unique and special treat . <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed !
LOW		the husband and i originally came here for a yelp cocktail society event and decided we should come back to try more of the menu since the appetizers were delicious . <sssss> i received an email regarding their christmas dinner , which included lobster bisque , so the husband was sold and reservations were made . <sssss> we sat inside , but the patio looked very pretty and inviting with the lights . <sssss> however , just a tad too chilly ! <sssss> our server was nice and helpful and while the restaurant did n't seem very busy , the service was a little slow . <sssss> -lrb- people seated after us received their food before us and such . <sssss> not sure where the holdup was ! <sssss> -rrb- the husband ordered the lobster bisque and i ordered the salad off the christmas prix fixe menu as our starters . <sssss> the husband liked his bisque and my salad was good . <sssss> neither appetizer was spectacular but not bad . <sssss> for our main course , both of us ordered the roasted beef tenderloin with horseradish potatoes . <sssss> the beef was tender and the potatoes were good . <sssss> i liked them together , as the beef needed a little extra spice . <sssss> the beef alone did n't have much flavor/spice otherwise . <sssss> -lrb- the husband was n't very impressed and had to order an extra side of horseradish . <sssss> -rrb- for dessert , we both ordered the bread pudding - big mistake . <sssss> yes , the portion of bread pudding was huge but it was also bland . <sssss> it was n't like any other bread pudding i 've had before , more like a thick sponge cut in half . <sssss> i saw other diners order the red velvet cake and was immediately jealous . <sssss> -lrb- i 'm a huge desert person and barely ate this bread pudding . <sssss> -rrb- overall , the dinner was okay , but definitely not my favorite . <sssss> for the price , i feel like we could have gone somewhere else and received a better meal overall . <sssss> *** not being factored into the review , but something i wanted to bring up : the husband and i received 2 gift cards from our yelp cocktail event - completely free . <sssss> this was a very generous offer from the establishment and much appreciated . <sssss> we were very excited to come back and to use the gift cards . <sssss> as we were paying for our meal , we had the waiter check the denomination as we were never told the amount on the cards . <sssss> unfortunately , one of the gift cards was blank . <sssss> i understand that they were free gift cards , but anyone would expect them not to be blank . <sssss> just a tad disappointing and hope no one else received a blank card as well ! <sssss> please note , this is not being factored into the review , as i am only basing the stars given on the food and service . <sssss> ***
MID		let me be frank : i love sacks . <sssss> i love their sandwiches so much ; i would drive a crazy distance to endure lunch time traffic and terrible parking just to have one of their delicious sandwiches . <sssss> when i come to this location , i always feel like i 'm going off to battle and will return victorious . <sssss> i usually call ahead , since the line to order can be out the door . <sssss> my favorite sandwich is the symphony - minus the sprouts . <sssss> i also love that it comes with a cookie - yum . <sssss> this is one of my favorite lunch time destinations downtown and would jump at the chance to eat here . <sssss> however , i hate , hate , hate the parking . <sssss> it 's horrific ! <sssss> you can spend 15 minutes driving around , lurking and waiting for someone to come out just so you can snatch their space . <sssss> it takes so long to find parking , you could probably place an order form the parking lot and your sandwich would be ready by the time you found parking . <sssss> on top of this , the papa john 's delivery drivers block people in and that makes it even more of a cluster . <sssss> short story time : the parking is so bad that as i 'm trying to leave the parking lot , i get stuck behind this woman and i 'm patiently waiting . <sssss> as i 'm waiting , this guy gets in his car and just backs into me ! <sssss> luckily it was n't anything serious but damn . <sssss> it really is a battle for one delicious sandwich .
MID		a co-worker took me here for lunch a while back and i was instantly hooked . <sssss> i had to bring family and friends back for lunch and dinner . <sssss> this is definitely a fun and unique experience . <sssss> the inside is hip and modern . <sssss> it feels both secluded/intimate and open/airy at the same time . <sssss> i like that it 's downtown , although the parking can be tricky . <sssss> however , it is worth it . <sssss> the sweet potato fries are a must have . <sssss> they are cinnamon dusted and come with a dipping sauce . <sssss> my husband thinks they are too sweet , but i like them . <sssss> another item i 've gotten regularly is the gyro kisra - a flatbread with lamb , feta , and tomatoes . <sssss> the flatbread is soft and tasty and i really like the flavorful meat . <sssss> also , the tangier burger is delicious . <sssss> it comes with hummus spread , pesto , tomatoes , and manchego cheese . <sssss> i love the hummus and it really gives the burger a kick . <sssss> we 've also been here during happy hour and it sure is happy ! <sssss> certain nights have specific drink specials - like tini tuesday . <sssss> martinis are just $ 4 and believe me - you only need one or two ! <sssss> the small plates are $ 6 as well - plenty to choose from . <sssss> -lrb- try the hummus ! <sssss> -rrb- we have n't been for brunch , but it 's on our to-do list . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back again and again .
MID		ever since moving from phoenix to scottsdale , i have n't wanted to drive to downtown phoenix since it 's such a far drive , especially after work during rush hour . <sssss> unfortunately , that means i 'm missing some of my favorite restaurants ! <sssss> with a specific craving in mind , i went on a search and found tommy bahamas . <sssss> after looking at their menu and their happy hour , i told my husband we were going here after work last friday . <sssss> i 'm glad we did , because we had a really great time ! <sssss> we arrived about 5pm and it was n't too packed . <sssss> we had the option of sitting outside for happy hour , or going upstairs into the restaurants indoor bar . <sssss> we chose outside since the misters were going and wanted to unwind after being inside all day . <sssss> our waiter was quick to arrive and take our drink orders . <sssss> both of us ordered the crazy cuban off the hh menu - a cocktail of rum , pineapple juice , and banana liquor . <sssss> it was one of my cravings and it definitely hit the spot ! <sssss> then we ordered the fish tacos and edamame hummus off the hh menu as well . <sssss> my husband ordered the crab bisque off the dinner menu . <sssss> the food arrived quickly and we dug in . <sssss> the tacos were great . <sssss> we both really enjoyed them and would order them again . <sssss> the hummus was okay . <sssss> it was cold and came with long rectangular crackers they called flat bread . <sssss> to me , flat bread is like pita bread and they were crackers . <sssss> there 's a difference . <sssss> my husband thought the hummus was good and he ate more of it than me . <sssss> still a little hungry , we decided to order the cuban . <sssss> oh god , i am so glad we did . <sssss> it had pulled pork , ham , gruyere cheese , pickles , and spicy mustard . <sssss> this was a flavor combination of the gods . <sssss> my husband and i really enjoyed this and it 's our new favorite . <sssss> it came with yucca fries , which we decided to try , but you could sub them for something else . <sssss> -lrb- yucca fries are made from the root of the yucca plant and are like deep fried potatoes - they were n't anything special in my opinion . <sssss> -rrb- finally , the dessert tray came circling around . <sssss> they had so many delicious looking desserts to try . <sssss> a chocolate cake , a butterscotch pudding , a pineapple crème brulee , a pina colada cake , and a chocolate malt tart . <sssss> we ordered the chocolate malt tart but it was a tough decision . <sssss> -lrb- we 'll have to come back to try some of the others . <sssss> -rrb- the tart was delicious was very heavy . <sssss> we took about 90 % of it home to enjoy later . <sssss> overall , it was a great experience and we 'll be back . <sssss> i 'd recommend going during happy hour especially !
MID		this place has terrible parking but fantastic pizza . <sssss> my husband and i started coming here for their thursday date nights after 6pm . <sssss> for $ 20 , you can get an appetizer , a pizza , and two salads . <sssss> it 's a great deal ! <sssss> we both really like their pizza - it 's got this fantastic crust that is flavorful and both chewy and crunchy at the same time . <sssss> a perfect combination ! <sssss> plus , there 's plenty of toppings to choose from - all forming fantastic pizzas . <sssss> the appetizers are pretty generic - fried calamari , french fries , caprese , green beans , etc. . <sssss> none stand out as amazing , but my husband really likes the calamari . <sssss> our favorite salad is the strawberry and gorgonzola . <sssss> our favorite pizza is the roasted mushroom as it has pancetta on it as well . <sssss> then for dessert we usually order their chocolate chip pizza cookie - warm with vanilla ice cream ! <sssss> we normally sit at the bar , since the dining area can be full , but our bartender/waiter has always been super friendly and helpful . <sssss> all of the staff here are really friendly and i always feel like i 'm coming to hang out with the locals . <sssss> this place has a great atmosphere !
MID		i really like sprouts but i only come to this specific sprouts location when visiting the bookman 's next door . <sssss> when you first walk in , you are greeted by delicious looking pastries , muffins , breads , etc. . <sssss> then comes the deli/meat counter and the produced . <sssss> the produce selection is the best part of the store and they always have great deals going on . <sssss> i love getting my fruit - especially berries - from here . <sssss> i can usually walk away purchasing a bunch of items and spending very little money . <sssss> the store is clean and the staff is friendly . <sssss> if you are in the area , definitely check this place out . <sssss> you might just find something new and delicious !
LOW		the husband and i almost always order the baked chicken wings -lrb- no sauce -rrb- , the greek salad , and the puttanesca pizza . <sssss> oh , the puttanesca pizza ... yum . <sssss> we 've tried a few other things , but these are definitely our favorites . <sssss> the happy hour drink specials are n't anything special , but all appetizers are 50 % off . <sssss> there are lunch specials as well , but we really like this place as a quick dinner spot . <sssss> they have a power card , so every $ 100 spent , you get $ 10 off . <sssss> this is nice and can add up quickly . <sssss> for an arizona chain , this place has some good gourmet pizza .
MID		my husband and i come here frequently for our weekend movie experiences . <sssss> we like showing up before noon , since the ticket price is $ 5 per person . <sssss> such a great deal . <sssss> we also like this location since it is close to where we live and relatively easy to get in and out . <sssss> there are almost always good parking spaces , unless it 's later in the day , in which case you better watch out . <sssss> since this amc is at the desert ridge , you 've got to fight off other shoppers . <sssss> the actual theater is pretty standard compared to other amcs , but seems nicer . <sssss> there are plenty of seats and most screens are rather large . <sssss> this specific theater has an imax as well . <sssss> we 've only had one bad experience here . <sssss> we showed up one morning before 10am and the theater was closed due to some `` power issues '' . <sssss> we asked one of the girls outside turning people away and she would n't give any specific reason as to why . <sssss> she told us we could go to the amc deer valley or esplanade and handed us a printout of movie times -lrb- one that she wanted back -rrb- . <sssss> she did n't tell us to come back later or comp us for the inconvenience . <sssss> it was nearly impossible to make it to one of the other theaters for the next show time for the movie we wanted to see . <sssss> it was a major letdown and we did n't go back to the theater for almost half a year . <sssss> needless to say , we saw a movie here just last week after a hiatus . <sssss> nothing has changed and their power is working just fine .
LOW		my husband and i have been here numerous times . <sssss> the location is decent - i like that the biltmore/union shopping center is right across the street . <sssss> plus , fuego tacos is down below and tasty . <sssss> however , there is n't much else in this plaza . <sssss> a few places to eat , but whenever we visit , everything seems dead . <sssss> while the parking lot can get pretty full , there 's never anyone walking around . <sssss> it 's like a ghost town ! <sssss> my husband and i used to come here more frequently , but when they closed to upgrade to the dining experience , we realized the desert ridge location is much closer to us . <sssss> -lrb- we found out they were renovating the hard way . <sssss> we stopped by one afternoon to find the amc closed and none of the restaurants were open yet . <sssss> again , total ghost town ! <sssss> -rrb- needless to say , we have n't tried the new dining experience but it 's on our list . <sssss> once we try the new dining experience , look for an updated review !
MID		the husband and i drive by this place frequently and always say we should try it out . <sssss> well , we finally did on new year 's day . <sssss> we came for lunch and the place was deserted except for one lunch couple on the patio . <sssss> we stepped inside and the waiter told us we could sit wherever . <sssss> the husband informed him we will be sitting on the patio and back outside we went . <sssss> the patio is nice . <sssss> it 's open and airy , while still enclosed by trees and a deconstructed-looking fence . <sssss> music is playing via tiny bose speakers , there 's a fire pit -lrb- which looks inviting , but was n't lit -rrb- , and a tiny water fall -lrb- where cute sparrows bathed -rrb- . <sssss> the patio was very nice during the day but i bet it looks even more inviting at night . <sssss> our waiter came out and asked if we were ready to order and i asked what type of bread the sandwiches are on and how they are cooked -lrb- they are called `` wood fired sandwiches '' -rrb- . <sssss> he looked at me like i was ridiculous and i guess i felt a little silly , but i wanted to know if it was regular sandwich bread , pita bread , a bun , etc. . <sssss> he told me its bread and it 's thrown in the fire , not literally , but like near the fire . <sssss> i was confused but the prosciutto , copa , triple cream brie , tomato , and olive tapenade sandwich sounded really good ... so i ordered that . <sssss> the husband ordered the braised short rib calzone . <sssss> our meals came on a cute wooden cutting board with a side of crispy kettle chips . <sssss> my sandwich came on a bun , which was delicious . <sssss> overall , i really liked my sandwich . <sssss> it was a little on the salty side , but everything on the sandwich by itself is normally salty and delicious . <sssss> the husband was a little jealous and stole about half of my sandwich . <sssss> -lrb- which is fine , because i stole his chips . <sssss> -rrb- the calzone was good but it definitely was n't a traditional calzone . <sssss> it was wrapped in a flatbread , shaped to look like a calzone but definitely not fully enclosed like the calzones we are used to . <sssss> i liked the flavors , but was n't too impressed with the bread . <sssss> -lrb- both of us expected closed , doughy goodness . <sssss> -rrb- overall , it was a good experience and we really enjoyed our sandwiches . <sssss> we 're looking forward to coming back for dinner !
MID		i really felt like a sucker because i could n't find this place ! <sssss> luckily , when i called the hostess , she was able to tell me how to get there . <sssss> for anyone who does n't know where it is , searsucker is tucked between neiman marcus and a bank . <sssss> the parking is kind if ridiculous , so park at the mall if you get a chance . <sssss> it is n't a far walk and you might need a walk after all the delicious food you eat ! <sssss> the front entrance is spectacular . <sssss> it 's a large wooden door that seems foreboding like great castle doors , but also beckoning like a siren calling you to your delicious doom . <sssss> the inside is spacious and has some interesting décor . <sssss> ropes hang from the ceiling , like fishermen ropes entwined with the lights . <sssss> giant food related pictures hang -lrb- or are painted -rrb- on the walls . <sssss> one is a large knife with ketchup -lrb- blood ? <sssss> -rrb- and another is a roasted chicken on a spit with a live chicken 's head . <sssss> -lrb- this one kind of disturbs me ... -rrb- the bar is huge and wraparound style for easy access . <sssss> the dining area has plenty of tables for an intimate gathering or a large one . <sssss> my husband really liked the spicy shrimp and bacon grits , while i really liked the squid `` sweet heat '' -lrb- calmari steak with sweet sauce -rrb- . <sssss> i also really enjoyed the peter rabbit cocktail . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back !
MID		over the years , i have heard many good things about sweet republic but always felt it was out of the way . <sssss> the traffic near shea and the loop 101 is killer during the day and after work . <sssss> however , i finally decided to go at 9pm on a saturday , when the streets should be dead . <sssss> good thing they were , because i had to pull a u turn to get into the shopping center that houses sweet republic . <sssss> outside , there is ample parking and a few patio tables/chairs set up . <sssss> the inside is well lit with many tables , chairs , and half-booth seating . <sssss> there are two display cases with freshly made ice cream , an area with delicious toppings , and an ice cream freezer filled with to-go pints . <sssss> oh , and there 's a game area where you can pull out an old board game and play with your companions . <sssss> when i first entered , i was n't sure where to start . <sssss> while there is a board displaying the flavors of the day and the items they offered -lrb- sundaes , shakes , coffee , etc -rrb- i felt i needed to look at the ice cream to get a better sense of what i wanted to eat . <sssss> after a few samples , my husband decided on the coconut and lemon in a waffle bowl . <sssss> i went with a scoop of coffee with toffee brittle , salted caramel sauce , and a freshly toasted hand-made marshmallow on top . <sssss> it was delicious ! <sssss> -lrb- i 'm a sucker for toasted marshmallows and this one was amazing . <sssss> -rrb- there were so many flavors to choose from and so many sundae options as well . <sssss> i 'd love to come back and try all their other offerings . <sssss> i 'm definitely glad i finally gave it a try !
LOW		i have been to this outback two times in the past 2 years . <sssss> my most recent experience was much better than the first , which would explain why it took me so long to even try it again ! <sssss> really , i was dragged here by my in-laws , who love the surf and turf special they currently have . <sssss> you can get a lobster tail , a sirloin , and a baked potato for $ 9.99 . <sssss> it 's a good price for some decent food . <sssss> unfortunately , we splurged on the giant onion blossom and the artichoke appetizer . <sssss> the onion blossom was really good - i must have been craving fried onions cuz oooh baby , they were good . <sssss> they were a little greasy , especially near the end , but i had my fill . <sssss> the artichoke appetizer was good as well . <sssss> everyone thought it would be flat bread but this was tortilla thin . <sssss> still , not bad . <sssss> then came the meal . <sssss> my steak was ordered medium rare but came more medium-well . <sssss> the taste was n't bad , but i 've had better steaks at home . <sssss> the lobster was pretty good and the baked potato was meh . <sssss> i did n't eat it all , but who needs all those extra carbs ? <sssss> overall , it was n't a terrible experience . <sssss> i 'm not a big fan of franchise dining , but my in-laws chose the place . <sssss> i probably wo n't go back on my own volition , but if the in-laws wanted to , i would n't say no .
LOW		az mills was the first mall i ever visited when i first moved to phoenix back in 2005 . <sssss> since then , i 've worked there , shopped there , and seen imax movies there . <sssss> nowadays i visit maybe once a year for the imax but the mall itself has gone downhill . <sssss> it 's still the same setup , enter at one of the four entrances and walk in a circle to get wherever you need . <sssss> there are many new shops and not many i would really want to visit . <sssss> -lrb- the stores really cater to family and teenagers . <sssss> -rrb- on my last visit , i had to use the restroom and was pretty disappointed . <sssss> i would not recommend it . <sssss> overall , it 's seen better days and could really use a cleanup and facelift .
MID		we tried a sample of postino 's bruschetta at the local first fall fair in 2011 and desperately wanted to try it again . <sssss> luckily , when you sign up for their newsletter , you receive a coupon for a free bruschetta appetizer . <sssss> my husband and i immediately drove downtown . <sssss> first , the parking was pretty bad . <sssss> i know , its downtown and the parking is bad everywhere ! <sssss> -lrb- if only we lived closer , we could bike . <sssss> -rrb- second , the patio is awesome looking , but so packed we had to sit inside . <sssss> luckily , the inside is nice - it 's trendy and hip . <sssss> we sat at the bar inside and pondered over the menu . <sssss> i saw other folks enjoying wine , so i wanted to be just as cool and ordered a rose . <sssss> -lrb- it was good , but let 's face it , i 'm more of a cocktail girl . <sssss> -rrb- now , when you order bruschetta , you can get up to four different types . <sssss> we got the fresh mozzarella with tomato & basil , prosciutto with figs & mascarpone , warm artichoke spread , and smoked salmon with pesto . <sssss> we also ordered the warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus . <sssss> with both the dip and the bruschetta with warm artichoke , it was a little too much . <sssss> everything was really tasty , but definitely too much of a good thing . <sssss> overall , this is a really good place to get some appetizers and we 'll have to come back to try dinner and dessert . <sssss> ca n't wait !
LOW		after a rough day at work , my husband and i decided to treat ourselves by going out to zinc . <sssss> unfortunately , they were closed so we wound up at north instead . <sssss> well , it certainly is n't zinc so i wo n't compare it to that . <sssss> it is a fox concepts restaurant , so it did remind me a little of olive & ivy . <sssss> some of the dishes and ingredients reminded me a lot of olive and ivy -lrb- scallops , beef brisket , etc -rrb- and the cocktails sounded familiar . <sssss> when we first entered , we were greeted by two hostesses . <sssss> one of them asked where we 'd like to sit and lead us to a patio seating of our choice . <sssss> the inside was loud and filled with people whereas the patio was quiet and only had one or two other couples . <sssss> our waitress showed up rather quickly and took our drink order -lrb- just water -rrb- . <sssss> she came back with the waters and asked if we were ready to order . <sssss> i went with the scallops on mushroom risotto and my husband went with the beef short rib gnocchi . <sssss> our food arrived rather quickly and was presented nicely . <sssss> my dish was good but could n't decide what flavor it wanted to be . <sssss> the risotto was salty , extremely so . <sssss> the scallops were citrusy , extremely so . <sssss> then some areas were n't salty or citrusy . <sssss> it was n't a well-combined flavor experience and i felt like i had to eat it in pieces as to not shock my palette . <sssss> my husband enjoyed his gnocchi , whereas i thought the actual gnocchi was flavorless . <sssss> -lrb- the beef short rib was delicious . <sssss> -rrb- as the night progressed , i noticed that the waiters and waitresses did n't work in teams or even really acknowledge each other . <sssss> our water cups drained and our waitress did n't come back for some time . <sssss> however , two different waiters walked by , with a water pitcher and did n't fill our cups . <sssss> when our waitress finally did come back and asked if we needed anything , i mentioned water and she was quick to grab a pitcher and fill it . <sssss> i 've been to other restaurants where there is more of a team work/effort feeling and everything runs smoothly . <sssss> not sure if this was an off night or what .
MID		los sombreros is one of our favorite spots for mexican food . <sssss> my husband and i have been going here for years - back when we were first dating ! <sssss> we 've always had a good time and a good meal here . <sssss> however , we 've only ever eaten dinner/happy hour here . <sssss> our favorite is the puerco en chipotle . <sssss> it 's basically a huge portion of slow roasted and extra juicy pork in a chipotle sauce with oaxaca cheese on top . <sssss> oh my god . <sssss> this just melts in your mouth . <sssss> the flavors are so good together . <sssss> i just wish it had more cheese ! <sssss> my husband has had the lamb adobo before , which is a lamb shank in a spicy sauce . <sssss> again , this is really tender and flavorful . <sssss> i 've had the smoked chicken enchilada dinners several times here and they are consistently good . <sssss> the chicken is flavorful and blends well with the chipotle crema . <sssss> for happy hour we 've had the grilled ribeye steak tacos , guacamole , and well margaritas . <sssss> everything was good , but the steak was n't as tender as the other meats we 've had here and probably would n't order again . <sssss> for dessert , they have rotating flan flavors . <sssss> the traditional flan is my husband 's favorite , but mine is the bailey 's / kahlua flan . <sssss> oooh , oh so good . <sssss> this is a great way to end the night .
LOW		i love the restaurant 's billboard out front - tiger eyes peering at you , an invitation to try cuisine from faraway lands . <sssss> this is what brought my husband and myself in . <sssss> the parking lot is rather small , we were lucky it was n't too busy . <sssss> i can imagine it would be difficult to find parking if it was a busy night . <sssss> when you first enter , you have the option of dining inside -lrb- to your left -rrb- or outside on the covered patio -lrb- right -rrb- . <sssss> we decided to sit outside since it was such a lovely evening . <sssss> i ordered an iced thai coffee - which was delicious . <sssss> for an appetizer , my husband ordered the dragon eggz - dumplings with pork . <sssss> these came out promptly and were tasty . <sssss> for dinner , i ordered the ginger fish - breaded salmon with mushrooms , pineapple , onions , etc in a ginger sauce . <sssss> big mistake . <sssss> the salmon was more breading than fish and was swimming in the sauce - which i did n't particularly care for . <sssss> it was a disappointment , but i 'd like to come back and try something different since so many other yelpers seem to enjoy this restaurant .
MID		we came here after receiving a $ 20 off $ 50 coupon at the local first fall festival . <sssss> we stopped by around 1:30 pm on a monday with the in-laws in tow . <sssss> the in-laws did n't know that gf meant `` gluten free '' so they were in for a surprise ... after much indecision , i ordered the grilled cheese sandwich -lrb- with 3 types of cheeses , tomatoes , and avocado -rrb- and i asked for bacon on it as well . <sssss> the husband ordered the tuna melt , his sister ordered the portobello sandwich , and the in-laws shared the bbq bacon burger . <sssss> -lrb- some came with salads and others came with fries . <sssss> -rrb- we ordered the hummus trio as a starter as well . <sssss> the in-laws had never had hummus before and were leery of the delicious dish , but were pleasantly surprised . <sssss> the trio had red bell pepper , cilantro and regular hummus . <sssss> all three were delicious and we had to order extra pita . <sssss> the food came quickly after and everyone enjoyed their dishes . <sssss> the waitress was really nice and attentive to refilling out water and asking if we needed anything . <sssss> the place seemed pretty dead , but it was nice sitting on the patio . <sssss> -lrb- i had a nice view of the flat screen over on humble pie 's patio . <sssss> -rrb- it was nice to try a local business , and while we probably would n't have come here except for the coupon , i think we 'll be back soon .
LOW		i used to live closer and when i did , this was my go to mall . <sssss> overall , it is pretty easy to get in and out of the mall , since it has a circular set up . <sssss> i like that it is easy to park outside the large department store where i wanted to go and then i could easily navigate to another store within the mall . <sssss> weekends are definitely the busiest days for this mall - jammed with families and teenagers . <sssss> it became hard to navigate and those days i would n't want to go from store to store . <sssss> i exclusively came for the big department stores , such as jcp , dillard 's , and macy 's . <sssss> -lrb- sears always smelled weird and i avoided it . <sssss> -rrb- when smaller stores opened and closed , i did n't pay much attention to them since i was n't that interested . <sssss> i like coming here now for the food truck thursdays in the parking lot . <sssss> they have seating inside and this is a nice addition .
MID		i 've had samples of nothing bundt cakes at local events and have always thought they were super moist and delicious . <sssss> so delicious that i decided to buy a bundt cake for my mother 's birthday . <sssss> i had n't been to this store previously and the location is near a bunch of shopping areas but actually kind hard to find . <sssss> i accidently drove past the first time and had to turn around . <sssss> there was plenty of parking though , so that was nice . <sssss> the outside glass is reflective , so it was impossible to see inside - i was n't sure if they were open or busy . <sssss> i took a chance and walked in to find the store empty . <sssss> bundt cakes were everywhere and looking every inch of delicious . <sssss> an employee walked out and asked if i needed any help . <sssss> i told her i 'd take the 10 '' red velvet bundt cake in the display case and she went in the back to box it up for me . <sssss> she was extremely friendly and super talkative/bubbly . <sssss> she had definitely been getting a sugar rush from all the bundt cakes ! <sssss> as she was finalizing the box , i also ordered a tiny pecan bundt from the display case for my husband . <sssss> the employee was happy to oblige and i was on by way . <sssss> we kept the bundt cakes refrigerated and pulled them out prior to serving them so they had time to get to room temperature . <sssss> honestly , you could eat them directly from the fridge but letting them sit out does taste just a slightly bit better . <sssss> my mom really liked the cake and it was a success . <sssss> i 'd definitely go back and get more bundt cakes .
LOW		i ca n't believe this place closed . <sssss> they had fantastic service and a delicious chocolate mousse ! <sssss> my husband and i came here one night because i was being picky and could n't decide what i wanted to eat . <sssss> the night was already pretty terrible and not even the lively atmosphere of this place could cheer me up . <sssss> we sat on the patio , which was deserted . <sssss> -lrb- the real party was going on inside . <sssss> -rrb- honestly , i ca n't even remember what i ordered , since i was in a terrible mood , but after much indecision , i ordered a dish with shrimp in it . <sssss> it was way too spicy for me and i was really upset about this but stubbornly would n't switch dinners with my husband . <sssss> the waiter noticed i was n't enjoying my meal and offered to make me something else . <sssss> this was really nice of him and really appreciated . <sssss> the night got better when i ordered dessert . <sssss> they had this delicious triple chocolate mousse . <sssss> it had dark , milk , and white chocolate in a martini cup . <sssss> super delicious !
LOW		i had heard of miracle mile and used to work near the one on camelback but had never ate here until some co-workers invited my husband and me to lunch . <sssss> let 's just say there 's a reason why i had n't ate here previously and it 's because the food is just mediocre . <sssss> there are way too many items to choose from and i think that makes it hard to perfect the food being served . <sssss> i think if they narrowed down the menu , the food would be better . <sssss> also , being a deli , i would expect amazing sandwiches . <sssss> instead , they have mediocre sandwiches , burgers , hot dogs , salads , and entrees like lasagna , stuffed cabbage , meatloaf , and baked fish . <sssss> it really feels more like a cafeteria than a deli . <sssss> upon arrival , you have to wait in line - cafeteria style . <sssss> i 'm not real big on this as i feel rushed and it reminds me of high school cafeteria dining . <sssss> it was really hard to narrow down what i wanted to eat and honestly i ca n't even remember because it was n't that spectacular . <sssss> -lrb- i know i ordered my sandwich on wheat bread , which was just average . <sssss> -rrb- i also ordered fries with my sandwich . <sssss> i always think it 's hit or miss with fries and this was a miss in my book . <sssss> they were thick , but not steak fries . <sssss> so they were n't too crunchy and a little too soft . <sssss> also , they really needed some salt or any other spice . <sssss> both my husband and two co-workers ordered hot sandwiches - the pastrami and corned beef . <sssss> the co-workers enjoyed their meals , but they were the reason why we stopped here to begin with . <sssss> my husband thought his sandwich was okay , but again , nothing spectacular . <sssss> if the co-workers invited us to go back , i 'd have to politely decline . <sssss> this place was n't really what i was expecting and i 'm not real into cafeteria style dining . <sssss> obviously other people are , as the place was packed . <sssss> maybe they know something i do n't ?
MID		discovered this place during arizona restaurant week . <sssss> the food was extremely good . <sssss> the place is small and gets a bit noisy but the the short ribs make it worthwhile !
HIG		we always enjoy a good lunch at any pita jungle but we liked this one the best because of the lovely terrace and cleanliness of the place . <sssss> some pita jungle restaurants are a bit run down but this one is in great shape . <sssss> our waiter was very nice . <sssss> the salad with salmon was delicious !
MID		the chicken fundido is excellent . <sssss> the margeuritas are delicious . <sssss> i 'm not sure that i like the duck & turtle pond ... it seems a little gross . <sssss> there are lots of birds on the patio so we always eat inside .
MID		everything was very good . <sssss> the ambiance , the service and especially the food . <sssss> the crab cake appetizer was delicious ! <sssss> so was the filet mignon , the lobster and the chocolate godiva lava cake . <sssss> will definitely be going back !
MID		food was excellent ! <sssss> decor was fabulous ! <sssss> would have given 5 stars but was a little bit noisy . <sssss> will absolutely be going back . <sssss> soon i hope !
MID		food is always fresh and delicious . <sssss> the drink selection is interesting but expensive . <sssss> hummus appetizer is very good . <sssss> dumpling appetizer a little too `` fishy '' for me . <sssss> the bison burger is perfect . <sssss> love eating on the terrace .
MID		one of the best places for breakfast ! <sssss> everything is amazing but beware , the portions are huge !
MID		we always enjoy a good lunch at any pita jungle .
MID		have been here at least 3 times in the last 2 months . <sssss> the food is always good and the service is perfect . <sssss> line-ups get a little long on the weekends .
MID		nice store . <sssss> lots of fun things for gifts and stocking stuffers . <sssss> good prices also ... i found a book for 14.95 $ that i almost bought at chapters for 45 $ ! <sssss> the location is great too ... right next to wildflowerbakery and trader joes . <sssss> what an excellent way to spend a couple of hours !
MID		had the kobe burger and sweet potato fries . <sssss> the food was delicious . <sssss> everything you order is served on the side . <sssss> this is great because 2 people can order different things and then share . <sssss> the portions are big so we ended up boxing a complete burger to take home -lrb- 1/2 each -rrb- . <sssss> the sweet potatoes were served with a sweet caramel-marshmallow sauce that we also took home and later ate on a vanilla sponge cake ... it was yummy !
MID		fish and chip was delicious . <sssss> nice place to eat before a game .
HIG		excellent service ! <sssss> great product ! <sssss> meat cuts prepared as i waited . <sssss> prices reasonnable . <sssss> the best part was enjoying the excellent meals i prepared with the tender , tasty meat i purchased . <sssss> so happy to have found this place !
LOW		after all the great reviews i thought the food would be great . <sssss> it was n't . <sssss> we both ordered the ribs ith different side orders -lrb- fries , beans ... etc -rrb- the food is greasy , it thrown on a paper plate and served in a sloppy fast food style . <sssss> we left without eating our plates .
MID		delicious thai food - prawn , pumpkin and red curry was perfect and the eggplant green curry roll was also very good -lrb- less spicy of the 2 -rrb- .
HIG		you must try the salmon salad with risotto cake ! <sssss> i dream of it every day since ... the food was excellent , service great and ambiance very cozy on the terrace .
HIG		this place is awesome !!! <sssss> a real hidden gem . <sssss> i love the great variety of the menu . <sssss> went for a freinds birthday dinner , the 3 pair bruschetta was so good every one of the 3 different toppings were excellent . <sssss> for dinner i had the pomodoro fresco ... amazing ! <sssss> the wait staff was very nice and helpful . <sssss> recommend this place to anyone perfect for parties , date nights , casual meeting with friends .
MID		i enjoy coming here for a nice night of casual drinks and light dinner . <sssss> they have a great food selection on the menu as well as a great variety of drinks !! <sssss> it is a long way to drive from me so my friends and i try to meet up once every couple of months and it is always spot on .
HIG		orange blossom is my favorite ! <sssss> i really like coming here to have fun and relax with friends . <sssss> they have so many beers to choose from its great . <sssss> tons of games to play and very spacious .
HIG		i have never been here on dine it , it has always been lunch to-go . <sssss> i come here and get lunch at least once a week . <sssss> i love their food and sushi . <sssss> it is always so fresh and delicious every time . <sssss> the staff is always very friendly and well dressed .
MID		i have never had a bad experience here , they have good lunch specials and happy hour . <sssss> the wait staff is always very friendly and helpful . <sssss> the tootsie maki is one of my favorite rolls here , and the interior decorations are pretty .
LOW		pretty good breakfast burritos , the carne asada and chorizo are the only ones i 've tried . <sssss> the salsa isnt very flavorful . <sssss> much better than fillibertos .
MID		this place is perfect for a quick slice on the run or a late night on mill ave. they have a good variety of flavors and nice , friendly staff .
MID		not a very big fan of mexican food but this place has some very good menu items that are authentic and tasty . <sssss> their rice is amazing , i always have a hard time finding a restaurant with good spanish rice . <sssss> the salsa is so good and i always oreder some to go . <sssss> the service is always spot on , and the deep fried ice cream is to die for !!!
MID		come here for lunch a lot , really enjoy the food . <sssss> the burgers are always so good , the fries are always hit or miss . <sssss> one of my the very few places i will eat a burger .
HIG		i love pita jungle - fresh , delicious , and healthy food ! <sssss> it is a great alternative to all the junk food near asu .
MID		really nice spot to hang out with friends and have a casual night out . <sssss> good food , good drinks , and nice decor .
HIG		i love mojo yogurt and i frequent this place at least 5 times a week !!! <sssss> it is my weakness , and i especially like eating frozen yogurt in the winter when its nice and chilly out . <sssss> i love that there is a nice variety of flavors and they are changing them quite often . <sssss> my favorite is the pom-n-r-g . <sssss> the staff is always very friendly .
HIG		when it comes to traditional breakfast i would rather eat at home then go to ihop or dennys , but us egg hit the nail on the head . <sssss> i love all of their food and its fresh and delicious . <sssss> very friendly staff and great service .
HIG		the best gym i have ever had a membership to !! <sssss> they are so clean , and i feel very comfortable working out . <sssss> the number of classes they offer are insane !! <sssss> the locker rooms are fantastic .
LOW		i really enjoy coming to eat here , there is a great selection of meats and veggies to create the perfect just for you bowl . <sssss> there is also a good selection of starches to go with your meat and veggies . <sssss> the drink specials are great as well . <sssss> the only thing i knock down from this place is the smell ... i dread the smell in here and for that reason i ususally do the take out . <sssss> they really need to get someone in here to deep clean the restaurant .
MID		ive only been here once for drinks with some friends so my review is only based on the drinks and the pretzels !!! <sssss> the pretzels were amazing ! <sssss> the drink selection was nice and our server was very friendly and helpful with describing all the different flavors of the beers . <sssss> nice little outdoor area and we played jenga before it was time to go .
MID		i really enjoy the dine in theater experience and this place has it down to a t . <sssss> the tickets are a little pricey but for all that 's included i find it well worth it . <sssss> i love the seating and the fresh , warm popcorn is always a plus . <sssss> i love soming here if i 'm going to watch a movie that is more than 2 hours long because its almost as good as the comfort of my own home . <sssss> it is a far drive but the great service makes up for it .
HIG		how do i even begin to describe how great the meat is here ? <sssss> everthing is so good here , the ribeyes are to die for . <sssss> once grilled juicy and delicious !!!
MID		really enjoy this place a lot . <sssss> great atmosphere , and it is clean , clean , clean . <sssss> the food is good and the service is okay at times . <sssss> great to come during lunch because its not so busy .
MID		i used to come here on a regular basis and i was very disappointed when they removed the focaccia bread from their appetizer menu . <sssss> i still come here on occasion and noticed they added a mediterranean focaccio under small plates , so that makes up for the removal of the appetizer version . <sssss> i really enjoy the garlic cream fettuccine . <sssss> and the atmosphere is always very nice . <sssss> the servers are always so nice and attentive .
MID		my review is soley based on the food , i have only had takeout here i 've never dined in . <sssss> i like sun asian , its good for a quick meal for pick up and a better alternative to panda express . <sssss> i really like the honey chicken and the orange chicken , and it comes in a combo which is great . <sssss> the crab wontons are my favorite to order , full of cream cheese . <sssss> the sushi rolls are good also .
MID		i really enjoy and have always enjoyed the cheesecake factory . <sssss> they have never gotten it wrong with the vast menu and so many different dishes to choose from . <sssss> i really try to only eat here every now and then especially since so many of the menu items are so full of calories and sodium . <sssss> have always had great service and friendly , knowledgeable staff .
MID		good food and a great restaurant/bar to replace darcy mcgees . <sssss> their food is very good and they have great drink specials . <sssss> they also did a very nice job remodeling the inside it 's very warm and inviting
LOW		i love when a tiny eatery outshines a bigger chain , but lobby 's basically is a stripped-down portillo 's that does n't compare to the chicago italian beef giant . <sssss> kudos for fast , friendly service and grass-fed beef .
HIG		ted 's is one of the few hot dog joints where the hot dogs actually are better than the pricier sausages . <sssss> but do n't get me wrong , everything they serve is good . <sssss> i first had ted 's when i was 8 years old , and it remains my favorite dog in arizona . <sssss> every weiner is perfectly charred over coals . <sssss> and the onion rings are battered and wonderful , more like an awesome blossom than breaded , frozen fast food rings .
LOW		i 'm not a crazy big fan of mixologist cocktail bars , but sidebar skips the razzle dazzle and just pours classy drinks , even if they have a few more posh ingredients than your average bar . <sssss> just do n't plan on getting drunk here without a credit card . <sssss> i attended for retro hi-fi , which did n't strike me as terribly retro and had a lot fewer dancers than i expected .
HIG		the best mexican food i ever have eaten . <sssss> my date said it best , `` i 've died and gone to mexican food heaven . '' <sssss> my mom had lamb on special . <sssss> it was superbly cooked , with one side slightly crisp and the other delightfully tender . <sssss> garlic mashed potatoes and perfectly grilled zucchini rounded out her plate . <sssss> i had shrimp tacos , which were plump , juice and fresh . <sssss> the complimentary guacamole made fresh at the table with avocado , cilantro , tomato , pomegranate , salt and pepper put me on another planet . <sssss> my cousin always orders the pulled pork torta , which is amazing and gigantic . <sssss> and my lady had halibut topped with lobster , shrimp , crab and scallops -- a seafood-lover 's dream . <sssss> the only low point on the menu is the sangria , which she returned to the server in favor of a glass of quality red wine . <sssss> i refuse to visit phoenix without making a stop at barrio .
LOW		taste of tops has an incredible selection , but i do n't see what all the hype is about . <sssss> granted , i attended during a fairly lame halloween party when the bar was crowded . <sssss> i 'll have to try again .
MID		pineapple and pepperoni with extra sauce . <sssss> i know it sounds weird , but it 's a great combination at spinato 's . <sssss> the sauce is boss , and i ca n't get over how perfectly chewy and crisp the crust is . <sssss> while at spinato 's , i was treated to a display of the restaurant 's outstanding service . <sssss> a table of business diners were upset because one had asked for cheese after receiving a calzone and did n't realize that meant making a whole new calzone . <sssss> instead of appreciating the lengths spinato 's will go to provide a fresh , delicious meal , she shrieked , `` ca n't you just throw some cheese on top ? '' <sssss> and her pal was mad because he asked for sweet peppers and then ate his sandwich before the peppers arrived . <sssss> to the servers ' credit , they comped a few items , boxed what could n't be waited for and apologized profusely . <sssss> i would n't have handled it so well . <sssss> so , for me , spinato 's does n't compare with pino 's , but we 're talking a different style of pizza . <sssss> i certainly will be back when in arizona .
HIG		one of the best things about moving to tempe from chandler was being closer to the chuck box . <sssss> my older cousin and uncle took me there as a treat when i was a child . <sssss> as a grown-up , i was there almost weekly . <sssss> few things make me happier than scarfing down a perfect burger with a cold coke , snacking on some fries , sitting on a wooden box and swatting at the occasional fly . <sssss> i miss you chuck box , and i want a framed portrait of big juan for my living room .
MID		sure , the fishtank looks gross and the decor is far more shabby than chic , but nobody comes here for the ambiance . <sssss> the food , man , the food is incredible . <sssss> there is n't a bad thing on the menu . <sssss> the cheese naan is so wrong but so right . <sssss> the chicken tikka masala is on point , and the goat biryani is so tender and flavorful .
MID		if henry rollins ' eyewitness account is your only concept of sky harbor , you really need to see it for yourself . <sssss> i only fly from terminal 4 -lrb- southwest airlines -rrb- , and it 's my favorite airport terminal in the united states . <sssss> i 'm always in and out in a flash ; the wi-fi is free , and cute people are all over the place . <sssss> the phoenix metro area is built on convenience and space , and the airport is no exception . <sssss> my only complaint is a fairly crappy food selection .
MID		whenever i drag friends along to return to my arizona roots , i take them to elmer 's . <sssss> the strips are out of this world . <sssss> if you have n't had them , imagine chips topped with shredded -lrb- not melted -rrb- cheeses . <sssss> plop on some hot sauce -lrb- conveniently offered in ketchup bottles for maximum squeezage -rrb- for a heavenly combo . <sssss> i highly recommend the mini chimichangas with a huge soda . <sssss> oh , and park around the back .
MID		the rogue had two eras , as far as i 'm concerned : the couch days and now . <sssss> the couch days were great . <sssss> we 'd drink cheap beers , listen to rock music and eventually get so tanked we 'd have to lean on one another while sinking into the couches and laughing our heads off . <sssss> now the couches are gone , and the crowd skews a little bit younger . <sssss> but they 're fun and looking for a good time . <sssss> i do n't think i ever have left shake , the saturday dance party at rogu , e without plans for an afterparty or makeout session . <sssss> as others have said , be sure to park in the neighborhood , because the parking lot is microscopic .
HIG		tott 's reminds me of my favorite chinese eatery in chicago : friendship restaurant . <sssss> everything tastes fresh , and the boxed presentation of to-go foods is top notch . <sssss> my favorite menu item , for only $ 6.25 , is the sampler plate . <sssss> three spring rolls , four pot stickers and four cheese puffs with dipping sauces come in a box on a bed of lettuce . <sssss> everything is perfectly cooked , with a touch of firmness on the pot stickers , cheese puffs with crunchy tips and soft bodies and spring rolls that taste like spring . <sssss> no msg . <sssss> pure vegetable oil . <sssss> trimmed meats to reduce fat , and an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks . <sssss> easily my favorite fast chinese in arizona .
MID		as much as i dislike chain restaurants , the maple harvest super greens is the best salad i ever have eaten . <sssss> well worth the 830 calories and $ 10 .
MID		reasonable prices for reasonable portions . <sssss> you probably wo n't be taking a doggy bag home . <sssss> the salsa bar is fresh , and the service is speedy .
MID		typical anglophiles , my lady and i gravitated toward the tea garden . <sssss> but that does n't mean we did n't love photographing and learning about the myriad plants that call the desert home . <sssss> i was particularly enchanted by the century agave and giraffe trees . <sssss> give yourself plenty of time to walk the garden 's many loops . <sssss> i would recommend at least four hours .
HIG		casey moore 's is all about reunions . <sssss> any time i 'm in arizona and want to see my old friends , i find them at casey moore 's . <sssss> it 's like being the lunchroom in elementary school again , moving table to table and mingling . <sssss> seriously good times . <sssss> i honestly have never gone to casey moore 's and not run into someone i know .
LOW		raised in a persian household , i know a good kabob when i eat one . <sssss> tasty kabob , while among the best persian restaurants in arizona , falls short of famous kabob in sacramento and many los angeles joints . <sssss> still , it 's better that any kabob i 've had in new york , chicago or london . <sssss> still , if i have a hankerin for kabobs and rice , and do n't feel like making them myself , tasty kabob does the trick . <sssss> if you go and have never tried persian food , go with the kabob koobideh . <sssss> trust me .
LOW		although i did appreciate corbin 's taking care of our big group , i 've got ta wonder why a bar and grill would shut down at 10 p.m. on a sunday when 13 people were willing to keep eating and drinking . <sssss> when i arrived , i saw the yelp group drinking beers and eating bar food , and i thought , `` oh , this place must have some specials going . <sssss> i mean , it is sunday night . '' <sssss> to the contrary , the grub was pricey . <sssss> burgers were $ 9 . <sssss> i settled on some onion rings -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- , which really were good . <sssss> maybe i 've been spoiled in chicago , where drinking on a sunday or monday will get you dollar burgers , dollar beers and free snacks . <sssss> i did notice they split a huge bill among several yelpers who wanted to use credit cards . <sssss> most places wo n't do that . <sssss> also , if you 're looking for the soap in the men 's room , it 's in a squeezie bottle . <sssss> it makes no sense atop the futuristic granite sink . <sssss> what 's up with that ?
HIG		notice to restaurant staff : if you screw up and order , just quickly do something to make up for it . <sssss> cornish pasty prepared a cheesesteak pasty when we asked for a mediterranean chicken . <sssss> you know what the server did ? <sssss> she noticed the order was wrong and pre-emptively had the cook make a mediterranean , then delivered the cheesesteak to our table , free of charge . <sssss> that kept everyone in a good mood so we could enjoy our other pasties and buy a few more kilt lifters . <sssss> everyone wins . <sssss> note : the lamb vindaloo pasty is very spicy , so be prepared . <sssss> my girlfriend adored the lovely bit a salmon pasty . <sssss> and do n't skip the garlic fries .
LOW		visiting my mom in chandler , i had a hankering for teriyaki . <sssss> my mom said mikado had a great lunch special , so we went . <sssss> if your idea of `` special '' is warm spicy tuna rolls and chicken that tastes like someone made it in a toaster oven , then mikado is pretty damn special . <sssss> i like my teriyaki very saucy , very sweet and a bit charred . <sssss> no such luck . <sssss> i ca n't think of a single thing they did right . <sssss> i suppose the price was ok : $ 7.95 for teriyaki , white rice , miso soup , a small salad and a four-piece spicy tuna .
HIG		whenever i fly home from ohio , i try to hit all my favorite restaurants in the valley . <sssss> and i generally get to each of them once . <sssss> i get to in-n-out at least twice . <sssss> it 's just that good . <sssss> i honestly could eat it every day of my life if my waistline would allow it .
LOW		i 'm sorry , but hamburgers should n't cost $ 9.50 . <sssss> the sweet potato fries are delicious , but i felt guilty pigging out on greasy foods with all the chrome and blacklight illuminating the hipper-than-thou disco-type dining area . <sssss> i prefer dining in places that look like diners . <sssss> anyway , i appreciate that delux is open late . <sssss> i appreciate the attention to ingredients . <sssss> i just do n't like the price and the late-90s `` modern '' look of the place . <sssss> and the generic techno backbeats made me wish for a jukebox or my ipod .
LOW		arizona natives know the magical tranquility that comes from stepping out of ultra-bright heat and into cool , cool darkness . <sssss> yucca reminds me of the tempe and chandler bars of my childhood , where my friends ' moms would let us run around while they sipped coronas with leathery men . <sssss> i returned sunday night after years away , and the new sunday night bartender is an absolute knockout . <sssss> it made the $ 3.75 bud lights easier to swallow .
MID		after getting over the sticker shock -lrb- and i was n't paying -rrb- , i sipped on water and chatted with my cousin for what seemed like an hour . <sssss> he wisely ordered a salad , which held us over as the sun set , the seasons changed and my nephew made his way through elementary school . <sssss> the caesar salad had the perfect amount of dressing , quality lettuce and fresh-ground pepper . <sssss> a small order was enough appetizer for two guys . <sssss> the pizza finally arrived , and it was fantastic . <sssss> we ordered a large white pizza with pepperoni , sun dried tomatoes , onions and sausage . <sssss> the toppings were perfect , and the crust was divine . <sssss> grimaldi 's only uses fresh ingredients , and it makes a world of flavor difference . <sssss> one factor that annoyed me but pleased my cousin was the constant interruptions by the waitstaff . <sssss> `` more water ? '' <sssss> `` everything ok ? '' <sssss> `` anything else ? '' <sssss> `` how 's that pizza working out for you ? '' <sssss> how 's the pizza working out for me ? <sssss> the hell ? <sssss> if you see my water empty , fill it . <sssss> if i 'm not complaining , everything 's fine . <sssss> you can ask me once about that . <sssss> do n't cut off my dinner conversation with a repetitive interview . <sssss> my advice : call ahead and order your delicious pizza . <sssss> you can skip the wait , avoid the waitstaff and save some bucks on tip .
HIG		i just absolutely love this bev mo more than any other bev mo in az ! <sssss> all of the staff is so wonderful and perfect ! <sssss> have never had one problem or complaint ! <sssss> i work for a promotional company so i do a lot of tastings through out the valley and my favorite place to go is here ! <sssss> they treat all their customers with the most upmost respect and make you feel right at home ! <sssss> if i could give them more stars , i would !
LOW		if i could give zero stars , i would . <sssss> just about the worst experience for my friend and i . <sssss> we came in for a quick and easy dinner . <sssss> after being ignored at the door way repeatedly , we sat ourselves . <sssss> first , we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus , but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back . <sssss> our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving . <sssss> i have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone . <sssss> they 're lazy , slow , and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there . <sssss> the happy hour prices are great , but there are other ra 's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location .

LOW		i did n't really like this place when i first went , maybe a year and a half ago , and have n't really been back since them . <sssss> but after iain b 's recent insistence that i give it another shot , along with the good reviews that it 's been getting lately , i went back and tried it . <sssss> i 'm afraid to say my opinion has n't changed much since the first time . <sssss> i ordered the vegetarian platter , almost $ 10 after tax . <sssss> you get three falafels , three dolmas , a splat of babaghannoush , a splat of hummus , a couple of black olives , lettuce , tomato , a small container of tzatziki and a small container of what appeared to be seminal fluid mixed with flour and lemon juice . <sssss> what i 'd imagine seminal fluid mixed with flour and lemon juice to taste like , that is . <sssss> in order of tastiness : the dolmas were good -lrb- they pretty much taste exactly the same from restaurant to restaurant -rrb- , the tzatziki was good with a decent consistency -lrb- although a little overboard with the dill and not enough cucumber -rrb- , the hummus was good , falafels were the same store-bought mix that jt gyros has and did n't even have sesame seeds - plain bog average tasting , the babaghannoush was a little too slimy and lacked the smoky eggplanty flavour that i like , and the other fluid was n't particularly good . <sssss> all in all it was a terribly average meal . <sssss> maybe the meat might have tasted nicer but i do n't usually get anything except chicken from places like this , and that 's if i feel like eating something other than vegetarian on the day -lrb- if i do , i generally go somewhere else other than a mediterranean-style place -rrb- . <sssss> the pita bread was store bought and heated in a toaster oven or something , plain and simple . <sssss> as it cooled down , it turned into shoe leather - exactly like jt gyros ' . <sssss> i have to reiterate - if you have n't tried greek wraps down on bell , you have to . <sssss> do yourself a favour and buy a chicken kabob wrap from there with the `` original sauce '' . <sssss> get a couple of falafels too . <sssss> compare with chicago gyros . <sssss> eat on consecutive days . <sssss> do the pita cool-down test too . <sssss> in my opinion , no contest . <sssss> a flat three stars for this place . <sssss> no kidding , i could have made this entire platter myself using items you can buy from your local frys marketplace , including the tinned peloponnese-brand dolmas . <sssss> except for the special sauce , i suppose .
LOW		unfortunately , it 's time once again to drop my rating of what used to be one of my favourite restaurants . <sssss> if this happened at any other place i 'd give it a 1 star and permanently avoid on principle , but because poaf have pretty much the best barbecue i 've ever tasted it 'll get a flat 3 , accompanied by a giant frown of annoyance . <sssss> so what happened ? <sssss> did the prices increase like they did at loving hut ? <sssss> no . <sssss> food quality dropped ? <sssss> no . <sssss> still cramped as a sardine tin inside with less than a snowball 's chance in hell of getting a seat at lunchtime ? <sssss> well , yes , but that is n't the reason . <sssss> this time it 's due to false advertising . <sssss> several weeks ago they came up with the idea of a loyalty card . <sssss> buy 5 meals , the sixth is free . <sssss> here 's my photo of it -lrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/825nc-s-cqg6hsul5gm2ca?select=ssvkmjtwyvgp3punafybsa -rrb- . <sssss> seems pretty obvious how it works , right ? <sssss> well , last time i was there i reached the free meal marker . <sssss> i usually get their `` smokin ' meal '' menu item - two types of meat , plus two sides and half a sausage . <sssss> however when i tried to claim the free meal the counter girl informed me that they do n't give that particular meal out as free because , quote unquote , `` there 's so much meat in it '' . <sssss> which equates to about two fistfuls of meat , half a sausage like i said , plus maybe eight ounces in canned baked beans and sweet potato fries . <sssss> she then tells me that i can get any of the other items on the menu for free , or else she could give me a free drink or , `` say . <sssss> . <sssss> three dollars discount '' . <sssss> the card did n't say `` excludes smokin ' meal '' . <sssss> they brought me there six times and told me the card was frickin next to worthless . <sssss> get another menu item for $ 7 for free , or get $ 3 off my smokin ' meal which is only a couple of bucks more than the items they classify as free ? <sssss> wow . <sssss> i 'd have been happy to show up here forever and pay their asking price for a meal . <sssss> but the fact that they pushed off a loyalty card on me then told me to gfy when i tried to claim on it is rank as hell . <sssss> fail , lose two stars , seacrest out . <sssss> oh , seacrest back in for another ten seconds . <sssss> went there today , bought the usual , girl did n't offer me another card or mention the concept at all , left . <sssss> still delicious ; still pissed at them . <sssss> seacrest out again .
LOW		firstly , this is the best buffet i 've found in arizona . <sssss> i have n't done too much looking on the scottsdale side , admittedly -lrb- since it 's a little too far from surprise -rrb- , or in fact anywhere else except for the west side , but i have been to maharaja palace and sutra and you just get more variety here . <sssss> as for the quality of the food , it 's fairly middle of the road . <sssss> i did n't hate anything , but i did n't particularly drool over anything either . <sssss> i 'm impressed that they have lamb curry in the buffet though - being an aussie i 've grown up with lamb as a staple meat and love it -lrb- it 's way too rare to find in the us though -rrb- . <sssss> but when i say `` the best '' , i 'm only ranking it in a comparative sense . <sssss> read on . <sssss> . <sssss> i got a-la-carte take-out from india palace for the first time last night . <sssss> i 've done this several times from tandoori times ii and the smell has always assaulted my nostrils with deliciousness for the entire thirty min drive back home - enough to strongly consider pulling over and wolfing down a few mouthfuls before continuing the drive . <sssss> with india palace , the `` travel smell '' was n't as overpowering . <sssss> . <sssss> not exactly a good thing since that pretty much means they do n't use as many , or as strong , spices . <sssss> i like strong spicy food . <sssss> on the other hand , my car did n't retain the smell the next day . <sssss> next , i compared apples to apples taste-wise . <sssss> i ordered their chicken tikka masala and the lamb vindaloo - my standard choices . <sssss> ttii 's dishes were simply more flavorful . <sssss> i mean , the wife and i both liked india palace 's versions but it was n't worth more than three stars . <sssss> also got the aloo gobhi - it was a-ight , but i 've ~ made ~ better . <sssss> and that 's saying something . <sssss> the vindaloo was n't actually spicy at all , despite me asking for all dishes to be prepared `` medium '' spicy . <sssss> i did n't need a drink for the entire meal . <sssss> amount-of-food-wise , you do appear to get a little more food for your money with this place - more solid meat in the containers than sauce , whereas ttii rips you off with 50/50 sauce/meat ratio . <sssss> a 10oz container of food for over ten bucks -lrb- such as those from tandoori times ii -rrb- is beyond highway robbery , especially when you can get enough good chinese food to almost give you a hernia carrying it out of the store , for twenty bucks at chen and wok . <sssss> the naan was plain old average . <sssss> and ip 's naan completely failed the microwave reheat test . <sssss> i nuked half a naan for about 20 seconds today . <sssss> the resulting cracker had all the juicy softness of a frozen dorito . <sssss> hell , i was n't expecting sponge cake but i ~ definitely ~ was n't expecting a crunch that made my teeth hurt and my ears ring . <sssss> so , i 'll probably go back , and i may even get takeout from here again , but i continue to lament the quality of indian food on the west side . <sssss> would some enterprising business person please open an indian restaurant somewhere west of the 101 -lrb- and north of the 10 ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm so sick of nail salons , pizza places and dentistries being the first , second and third businesses respectively to open up in any new strip malls . <sssss> sigh .
LOW		fairly decent place . <sssss> been here a couple of times . <sssss> i 'd actually ordered a meal a few days ago and logged into yelp on my phone to read the reviews - pity i did n't read about the wings sooner ! <sssss> anyway , i got the d'angelo pasta - fettucine with mushrooms and a rather nice cream sauce . <sssss> other time i was here i got their italian special sandwich . <sssss> not too bad - nothing ultra-spectacular -lrb- i still prefer mr goodcents for sub sandwiches and my own home-made pasta to anywhere else 's -rrb- but a decent lunch destination . <sssss> pasta was $ 12 , add a soda and walked out of there $ 18 poorer . <sssss> bit steep for lunch . <sssss> sandwiches of course are a bit less expensive . <sssss> at lunchtime the place was actually quite full - the seating technician advised that there was a tiny table up the back but i was there with one of the other dudes from work and did n't really feel like getting that close up with him , so we sat at the bar . <sssss> service was great , food came out quick , was fairly tasty , sodas refilled quick -lrb- we were at the bar , duh -rrb- . <sssss> i 'd get take-away next time - it 's just expensive enough for me to prefer not to have to pay the extra $ for a tip . <sssss> not with gas prices the way they are . <sssss> i 'll probably go back maybe once every two weeks or so . <sssss> it 's just a-ight far as i 'm concerned . <sssss> i may upgrade my rating after my next visit if the wings turn out to be as good as luke s. says they are . <sssss> doubtful they 'll top the wings at uncle sam 's , though . <sssss> their sub sandwich sure did n't top sam 's all-american grinder which is my current favourite hot sub .
HIG		ca n't recommend this place highly enough . <sssss> it 's a heck of a drive here from where we live in surprise but it 's my 4-year-old 's favourite place to play . <sssss> after the first couple of visits we got the 3-person membership for a year which will save us a ton of money since we 'll probably go here at least once every couple of weeks . <sssss> it 's a `` museum '' only in the loosest sense ; in fact as others have mentioned it 's actually a giant playground with tons of things to see and do spread across multiple floors . <sssss> a list of all the playthings inside can be found here -lrb- http://www.childrensmuseumofphoenix.org/facility/exhibits.aspx -rrb- . <sssss> in particular , the schuff-perini climber , which is a giant structure resembling a treehouse with crazy stuff like a bathtub hanging off it , is phenomenal . <sssss> except when fat adults thinking to keep up with their children try to worm through certain parts of it . <sssss> they even have adirondack-style deckchairs in that room so that those seated down have a more elevated angle of view at their kids climbing two or three stories above them . <sssss> basically my kid , who at four is easily taller than most five-year-olds with the strength and energy of bam bam off the flintstones , rapid-fires every single plaything every time we go - rushing around the climber , then heading up the stairs to pedal furiously on the trikes , then running -lrb- a no-no , always have to tell him to slow down so he does n't blitz other kids -rrb- through the noodle forest , etc. . <sssss> it 's sensational to watch . <sssss> even more delightful is how hard he crashes out in the back seat of the car , dried sweat plastering his bangs to his forehead with his mouth in the shape of an o , not more than three minutes back on the road after leaving . <sssss> trust me , if you bring your younger kids here you will have a tough time getting them to leave at the end of the visit . <sssss> there 's also a gift shop with some interesting toys well-suited to kids under 10 - yesterday we bought my kid a `` marble racer '' -lrb- http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productid=10995054 -rrb- and the time before we got a giant plastic boat for bathtime . <sssss> the gift shop is a great incentive when it 's `` time to head home '' . <sssss> and the p.c.m. is also super close to mrs white 's golden rule cafe which is one of my favourite `` quirky '' eateries in phoenix . <sssss> take your young ones here , you wo n't be sorry . <sssss> just make sure you pack elbow pads , shin pads and helmets for them in case my kid 's there too * 8 - -rrb- let 's pretend i gave it ten stars . <sssss> edit : i created some panoramas of the schuff-perini climber on photosynth.net using the microsoft photosynth app on my ipod touch . <sssss> check em out . <sssss> # 1 : http://j.mp/kflvtc # 2 : http://j.mp/k0oarr # 3 : http://j.mp/jmdofn # 4 : http://j.mp/jc2eac
HIG		closed !!!!!! <sssss> edit : 20100716 : wait a minute . <sssss> this place is still open ! <sssss> i think they must have closed for some renovations - went there today and it 's definitely open for business with buffet and everything . <sssss> did n't look like it was renovated either . <sssss> please ignore my previous indication of it being closed . <sssss> still one of the better buffet on the west side , too . <sssss> looks like they got a new website . <sssss> .
LOW		i 've been to baby kay 's three times . <sssss> the first time was probably about eight years ago , and i honestly ca n't remember what i ate or any details so it can essentially be ignored . <sssss> the most recent visits were about a month apart and the last was today . <sssss> the food is okay , but extremely overpriced and underflavored . <sssss> the red beans and `` rice '' dish , w/andouille for an extra $ 1 , is essentially a plate of beans with about two tablespoons ' worth of white rice , plus about an ounce of their green olive coleslaw . <sssss> ok , it - was - reasonably spicy but should have been no more than about six bucks because what it really equated to was an appetizer as far as i 'm concerned , and the amount of beans grossly outweighed the amount of rice . <sssss> their special today was 8 fried shrimp with dirty rice crawfish etouffee and one side . <sssss> i got the coleslaw again . <sssss> the amount of food , for $ 14 , was pitiful - a half serving , essentially . <sssss> and this time the flavor was just totally lacking . <sssss> the full crawfish etouffee dish price is $ 19 which is murderously expensive and as i discovered today it just does n't have much flavour . <sssss> the dirty rice had what appeared to be minced beef in it and was light on the pepper . <sssss> even the garlic bread was n't any better than i could have made myself with a cheap baguette from fry 's , butter and some chopped fresh garlic . <sssss> i know everyone 's been fapping on about authentic flavour here , but if that 's what this is then i much prefer pappadeaux . <sssss> save your money - there 's no value to be had in this restaurant . <sssss> edit 20130902 : tonight my wife made a simple meal of a packet of store-bought tony chachere jambalaya with some chopped up polska kielbasa sausage in it . <sssss> it was delicious . <sssss> taste buds still working - check .
LOW		response to rob c : i was n't offered anything from any other restaurant . <sssss> you got this review because i 've eaten way better greek than what you serve . <sssss> you just trashed any chance you had of repeat business from me too , as i was - planning - to come back and try some more meat-oriented stuff as has been suggested . <sssss> incidentally , i could have sworn i wrote a review of greek wraps already , but looking through all the reviews -lrb- even the filtered ones -rrb- it seems i have n't . <sssss> they obviously did n't pay me enough eh ? <sssss> -lrb- snort -rrb-
MID		having moved office to the central ave corridor vicinity , i 've been checking out some new restaurants in the area . <sssss> i was delighted to know that 43rd express , my previous favourite phoenix vietnamese place , was just a few miles down the road . <sssss> however , a workmate told me about pho thanh and took me there for a meal . <sssss> and it 's now become my favourite v diner . <sssss> i 'd read a number of reviews on yelp indicating that this place is one of those hole-in-the-wall gems , and to tell the truth it 's not much to look at from the outside , just a dodgy door and blacked out windows in a nondescript brick building . <sssss> but you kinda get a bit of a shock when you walk in , because it 's way bigger on the inside than you 'd have guessed standing in the carpark . <sssss> seedyish , and very popular . <sssss> i saw all sorts of people inside , not just asians . <sssss> that 's always a good sign . <sssss> sat down and got my usual - pho dac biet , xe lua . <sssss> delivered quick and piping hot . <sssss> gigantic bowl . <sssss> tasted fantastic , although pretty light on the tendon chunks , which are my absolute favourite bits in the soup . <sssss> i also got a fresh coconut and had a joyous time draining it then scraping out the soft flesh with a long-handled spoon , feeling at times like a monkey with a damn cookie jar . <sssss> they accept credit cards , which is awesome - 43rd express does not , and since pho thanh essentially serves more pho in their bowl with the same quality i do n't think i 'll be returning to 43rd anytime soon ; i 'm also not keen on having to use an atm first every time i want to eat there . <sssss> get a credit card processing system in place , sheesh . <sssss> four stars . <sssss> lots of room inside , busy at lunchtime , good amount of chow , great taste , other yelpers really like it -lrb- we 're a discerning bunch , right ? <sssss> -rrb- and not too far from work . <sssss> oh , and the credit card thing . <sssss> i do n't mind the fact that they 've got these long tables where you could potentially be elbow-to-elbow with a stranger , either . <sssss> just an overall decent place to fill up at , with or without a crowd of workmates .
LOW		time for an update , and i 'm taking away a star for one reason . <sssss> the food has remained delicious and the lunch specials are priced right -lrb- the lamb vindaloo i had there on 4th july was awesome -rrb- , but there 's something that pissed me right off when i ordered takeout recently . <sssss> portion size . <sssss> it 's $ 9 - $ 11 dollars for an 8-oz container of food , depending on what you get . <sssss> get three different containers along with rice and a naan and you 're almost at $ 40 . <sssss> that 's way too expensive , no matter how tasty the food is . <sssss> i know how to make this stuff -lrb- technically , although i have problems achieving the flavour -rrb- and i know what the ingredients cost . <sssss> they 're making money hand-over-dot at this place and the final issue i have is that my 8-oz container of chicken makhani was less than half chicken and the rest sauce . <sssss> see my tandoori village review for more information on this . <sssss> they need to knock their prices way down . <sssss> i want a take-out meal for two and i want it to be under thirty bucks . <sssss> when i can get three pounds of chinese food for under $ 20 -lrb- see my review of chen & wok in surprise -rrb- , paying double that for less food does n't strike me as a particularly good deal . <sssss> do n't anyone make the mistake that this place is haute cuisine either . <sssss> it ai n't gaylords . <sssss> not by a long shot . <sssss> and gaylords is pretty far from haute cuisine itself .
HIG		holy crap was this place packed today !! <sssss> it 's gotten astronomically popular since it arrived in this location about two or three years ago , and despite being a decent-sized establishment , if you arrive dead on at midday you 're in for at least a five to ten min wait unless you 're lucky . <sssss> just like i wrote in my review of vogue bistro , i felt like i was n't dressed appropriately , although this time it was because while i was wearing brown camo cargo pants and a grey t-shirt , seemingly everyone else there - both typical patrons and servers alike - were dressed like they were starring in a wiggles on-stage production . <sssss> i 'm a big fan of the chicken tikka masala , which i 've been ordering ever since it was an experiment listed on a sheet of a4 paper attached to the main menu ; it 's now a regular item . <sssss> i also get the caramelized cauliflower with tahini which is utterly delicious . <sssss> i 'm not a big fan of cheap , sh1tty tattoos though , and i saw a whole stack of those too . <sssss> today was more or less a day like any other . <sssss> met the wife here , sat down , were promptly served our food . <sssss> i went for the lavosh shawarma wrap instead of my usual since i 'm trying to cut down on carbs -lrb- a very slight cutdown . <sssss> . <sssss> whatever ! <sssss> -rrb- but did get the cauliflower too . <sssss> the cauli was different today . <sssss> for a start , they brought it out on a full-sized plate , whereas it 's normally served on a side-item-sized plate . <sssss> was fine with me as the wife usually shares it . <sssss> while the lavosh wrap was absolutely delicious as i remember it being , the tahini sauce that went along with the cauli was weirdly sweet . <sssss> like it had sugar or syrup mixed in with it . <sssss> usually it 's a more tan color and savoury , but this time it was more on the amber/orange side . <sssss> when the server passed by i asked him whether the recipe had officially changed - he said no , and that they might have overdone one of the ingredients in the kitchen , but he definitely noticed the difference in color too . <sssss> i said i was asking because i would n't order it again if it tasted the same , but i 'm a big fan of the usual sauce . <sssss> he said he 'd check with the kitchen . <sssss> not more than a couple of minutes later he comes back carrying a giant dessert plate with a slice of duo-tone baklava on it , covered in giant sultanas -lrb- aka golden raisins , i believe -rrb- and dusted in cinnamon powder by way of compensation . <sssss> jesus on a pogo stick . <sssss> chevy chase could have tobogganed down a snowy hill on the bastard . <sssss> it was delicious - i should n't have eaten it but i did . <sssss> even the wife , who is n't a big fan of baklava , took a couple of bites and proclaimed that it was the best baklava she had ever had . <sssss> very nice of them to do this , especially being so busy . <sssss> double-size side item plate and a comped dessert for two - you folk in liberia are sure missing out ! <sssss> definitely coming back -lrb- i would have anyway , i had no major problem with the meal -rrb- . <sssss> i thoroughly recommend this place , it 's a great all-round location if you want reasonably healthy macrobiotic stuff in a funky kind of atmosphere , long as you do n't mind some of the saddest tattoos you 'll probably ever see . <sssss> they thoroughly deserve their high rating and a yelp ambassador should consider giving them one of those `` people love us on yelp ! '' <sssss> stickers that are inexplicably given to other places such as mr goodcents . <sssss> although , if you want proper fresh greek , greek wraps just up the road trumps them . <sssss> i 'd rock up there for a chicken kabob wrap on their freshly baked pita any day of the week . <sssss> and no , owner of chicago gyros , they did n't pay me to say that . <sssss> btw , greek wraps did a giant renovation around christmas last year , the place is almost literally three times bigger . <sssss> now if only haji baba 's would renovate that rancid cesspit they call a restroom . <sssss> .
MID		went back again today . <sssss> i quite like this place . <sssss> their stuff is n't extremely cheap -lrb- it 's tempting to go to pink lotus instead - under $ 6 for the same amount of food -rrb- but it 's not insanely overpriced and the place remains clean as a whistle . <sssss> it seems to be gaining in popularity too - had about five or six tables with patrons today , despite the supreme master telly droning on in the background . <sssss> it actually reminds me of the `` a new life awaits you in the off-world colonies ! '' <sssss> stuff from blade runner . <sssss> today 's programming showed some kangaroos jumping around and happily munching grass , along with someone blathering on about how studies have shown that they play an important ecological role in blah blah blah . <sssss> anyway ! <sssss> foodwise , i got my -lrb- now favourite -rrb- golden rolls , and decided to try something different with the chow mein . <sssss> the latter was good , but i probably would n't order it again since i liked other dishes better . <sssss> next time i think i 'll give the hawaiian burger a go . <sssss> i definitely recommend the golden rolls - the dipping sauce is great as well . <sssss> if you eat there rather than take away you 'll get a little bowl of soup - their version of miso , i guess , with carrot , green onion , celery -lrb- yeuch -rrb- and tofu bits . <sssss> came away feeling satisfied but not grossed out - typical of vegetarian meals . <sssss> i wish sweet tomatoes was a little closer , have n't been there in quite a while ! <sssss> you know , i wonder if this place would get pissed if i brought in a tiny can of cocktail shrimp to empty out into their vegetarian pho . <sssss> there are n't any signs saying meat eating on the premises is forbidden , although the entire place reeks of buddhist philosophy . <sssss> i remember getting reprimanded back in sydney when we used to go to the free hare krishna sunday feasts and bring our own cans of coke -lrb- `` krsna forbids intoxicants ! '' <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> or maybe if i picked up a chicken wrap from greek wraps down the road then brought it in to eat with a side of their guru fried rice . <sssss> after all , they 're selling a food style , not a lifestyle . <sssss> whatever the case , as mentioned in my previous review , this place is probably a once-a-week for me now .
LOW		went here for lunch yesterday with the boss . <sssss> i did a very cursory glance over the menu on their home page and was delighted to see that they had pho-style dishes here . <sssss> then only spent a second to check the yelp star rating before heading out from the office . <sssss> i read the reviews , as well as the owner retorts , after i got back home from the office - and laughed over the `` butt-hurt one '' . <sssss> . <sssss> * 8 - -rrb- reminiscent of the infamous amy 's baking company review and reply . <sssss> . <sssss> http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2010/08/ouch_todays_hard_lesson_on_yel.php for those of you who missed it the first time round . <sssss> . <sssss> anyway , i 've never had cambodian food before , but i 'm a big fan of pho and quite partial to thai food as well . <sssss> i 'm going to agree with the hard-to-findness of the location . <sssss> the boss let me know where it is , google maps and waze tried to tell me where it is , and i still had to circle back and triplecheck the map out front of a 99c store before i inched back out onto indian school and finally dodged into a tiny catty-corner parking lot with a giant mexican circular water fountain oddly set directly into the tarmac . <sssss> no other vehicles except the boss ' motorbike . <sssss> inside , greeted by the waiter -lrb- i assume yutheana -rrb- and sat with the boss . <sssss> place was completely empty -lrb- apart from us -rrb- but i liked the decor - including the concave xylophone up front which reminded me a bit of a dinosaur 's ribcage . <sssss> at the table , i ordered a diet cola . <sssss> it tasted a little odd - not horrible or anything , but sort of . <sssss> . <sssss> either the syrup was off or someone had put a tiny bit of honey in it ? <sssss> no matter . <sssss> i found the description of their phnomh penh soup too amusing not to order it - `` got guts ? <sssss> wahey - so does this soup ! '' <sssss> who could resist heart , liver , intestines , ground pork and shrimp in a pho broth ? <sssss> the boss ordered the amok fish . <sssss> the waiter came over for a bit of a chat and overheard us talking about how the place was hard to find . <sssss> apparently they used to have a sign out front . <sssss> . <sssss> which went away for some reason . <sssss> this place needs blinking neon lights and perhaps a sandwich-board holder wearing a pig intestine costume or something , because it 's absolutely nondescript when you 're driving past and i 'm actually very surprised to see so many reviews - must be word of mouth visits because it sure as hell would n't be people going `` hey , check this cambodian restaurant out that we 're driving past . <sssss> . '' <sssss> out came our dishes . <sssss> high marks for presentation - it all looked quite appetizing , especially the fish dish . <sssss> unfortunately , flavour wise , mine was . <sssss> . <sssss> just a ` ight . <sssss> i honestly do n't know what i was expecting , but it was n't as confrontational a flavour as i guess i thought it might be . <sssss> in fact it was rather bland . <sssss> i love spicy food - especially indian - but usually with pho i drown it in lemon or lime . <sssss> i put a squirt of lime down on the top and had a few bites . <sssss> shrugged at my boss . <sssss> surprisingly the lime did nothing for this dish - but a couple of big squeeze bottles of hot sauce had been supplied and i used that instead . <sssss> then the dish came somewhat alive ! <sssss> interesting . <sssss> would i get the dish i got again ? <sssss> probably not if i was hungry and/or after something with a little taste to it , but definitely if i wanted to shock friends . <sssss> the boss did n't mind his but said there were probably four other dishes he 'd like to try first before re-ordering the amok . <sssss> i did n't hate this place , i certainly did n't think the prices were too high like others observed , but it was n't stunning enough to warrant more than a `` passable '' rating imo . <sssss> now if only someone would open up a malaysian restaurant - the last time i had a decent laksa was over a decade and seven thousand miles ago . <sssss> sigh . <sssss> edit 20120414 : i came to your restaurant looking for lunch . <sssss> my review then went on to wish for a malaysian restaurant , riding a completely different train of culinary thought . <sssss> imagine star number 3 on my review start to flicker as its batteries begin to run out . <sssss> edit 20121030 : dropped to a single star based on the smart-mouthed and completely unnecessary response from the owner . <sssss> will not return .
HIG		back to poaf today . <sssss> i went yesterday , racked up my second yelp checkin , and then brought the wife in today for my third -lrb- = = $ 5 discount off meal -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm rapidly becoming addicted to the food here , although it 's pretty far from healthy and extremely distant from what i * should * be eating at lunch . <sssss> the wife claimed that this was some of the best bbq she 's ever had . <sssss> very friendly guys too . <sssss> i have to echo the observations of others though - it 's a small place and the fact that they have nothing but four-seater tables means that even when two people sit they blow two extra spaces in an already cramped area . <sssss> they either need a bench with bar stools , some two-top tables or a giant texas-style community eating bench . <sssss> yeah , i deliberately spelled texas with a lower-case t. today , the place was full but the counter dude said it was okay to sit at the coffee place just outside on the corner of the same building , which we did after i confirmed with the coffee gal that that was ok . <sssss> anyway , back to the food : i agree with the wife , it 's some of the best bbq i 've ever had . <sssss> the different sauces are great too - my favourite is the pulled pork with one of their hot sauces . <sssss> it 's nebraska hot , i guess - means that us southwesterners could probably pour it into our eyes without blinking - but still tasty . <sssss> five stars for flavor and value , two for seating arrangements . <sssss> as the place grows in popularity - and it will - they 're - really - going to need to address this issue . <sssss> as for me , i 'm going to enjoy this place as frequently as i can before our office moves to central and thomas later this year , whereupon poaf will unfortunately become a distant , delicious memory . <sssss> edit : okay , twice now i 've gotten the smoked meal and asked for no buns , and they 've given me buns . <sssss> minor mistake , but i 'll deduct a star if it happens again . <sssss> no buns equals ~ no buns ~ .
LOW		wow . <sssss> it 's not often i give a place less than three stars unless i had a real bad experience there , like shit service , huge wait or a cockroach in the pudding . <sssss> in this case , i 'll make a unique exception because i encountered none of those . <sssss> confused ? <sssss> read on . <sssss> the wife went here last night and grabbed dinner on the way to meet me and the kid . <sssss> it 's . <sssss> just . <sssss> chicken . <sssss> strips . <sssss> how can you make any sort of chain restaurant based on that ? <sssss> it 's bland and literally the most boring meal i 've ever had . <sssss> just one -lrb- small -rrb- step up from a glass of water in flavor . <sssss> let 's break it down : tasteless chicken with breading that makes even church 's , arguably the blandest food in the state , taste passable ; shoestring crinkle-cut fries - like del taco 's but half as thick -lrb- why ?! <sssss> -rrb- ; boring coleslaw ; boring sauce . <sssss> probably the tastiest thing in the box was the soft buttered toast , but hell if i ca n't make that myself at home , right ? <sssss> it 's just so absolutely pointless to go to this place . <sssss> go anywhere else . <sssss> mexican , burger , whatever . <sssss> i 'd rather eat airline food , seriously . <sssss> i felt like i needed to dip the damn chicken in sulfuric acid in the desperate hope that that could revive my clinically dead tastebuds five minutes into the meal . <sssss> and chicken strips are all they had on the menu , with the sides as mentioned above ! <sssss> i was still vaguely hungry but quit eating my caniac with half the meal to go , it was that un-special . <sssss> chick fil-a is a dozen orders of magnitude better than this place . <sssss> at least ~ they ~ have some sort of flavour . <sssss> making different kinds of breading available and giving the option for dark -lrb- = = flavour -rrb- meat chicken would go a long way towards getting this place an extra star . <sssss> making three , in case you are n't counting . <sssss> i appreciated the high-rating reviews i read prior to going here - additional reviews from those reviewers will help me profile restaurants i will never eat at and save me a crapload of angst and cash in the future . <sssss> but take your kids here . <sssss> they 'll love it . <sssss> it 's why i gave it one more star than i was planning to . <sssss> about a pound of half-eaten meal went into the trash last night . <sssss> wo n't ever happen again . <sssss> wife , it was n't your fault , it was mine . <sssss> and yelp 's . <sssss> -lrb- presses period key on keyboard at the end of that sentence so hard that the plastic splits -rrb-
HIG		this place is a vast distance from my house . <sssss> fortunately , i was in the area on business , met the wife and went here for lunch based on the positive yelp reviews and the fact that she 'd been here before and really liked it . <sssss> god i 'm glad i did . <sssss> the first thing that hit me was the smell as we walked in - amazing . <sssss> i 've been to a lot of indian buffets ; this one smelled the best . <sssss> so far , so good . <sssss> found our table but as usual with any given buffet , arse did n't hit the chair before i was schlopping food onto my plate . <sssss> dhal , channa , chicken curry , aloo gobhi , chicken tikka masala -lrb- out when i was at the buffet , but they filled it up pretty quick after -rrb- , meat and pea samosas , potato pakoras , and a giant laundry-basket-sized rice cooker to scoop from . <sssss> flung a few ribbons of raita jackson pollock-like -lrb- or ron jeremy-like , depending on your aesthetic sensibilities -rrb- across the heaped plate and back to the table to dine . <sssss> out came some garlic naan -lrb- better than regular naan ! <sssss> -rrb- which was thin and fresh . <sssss> making good on the promise of the initial smell , the food was very flavorful . <sssss> best buffet i 've been to . <sssss> the chicken curry was actually spicy , not dumbed down . <sssss> why the hell does this place have to be ~ 40 miles from my house ? <sssss> one thing 's for sure , i 'll be back . <sssss> maybe not for a while , but still - indian paradise rocketed to # 1 on my indian restaurant list after the first mouthful and i 'm pretty sure the same will be the case for any indian food aficionado that tries it . <sssss> word of warning - it may be too much of a punch in the mouth for newcomers to the cuisine - if that 's you , i suggest getting your feet wet at bombay spice -lrb- tatum and shea -rrb- first before trying this joint . <sssss> came out with my gut looking like an alien was going to bust out of it and my tastebuds feeling as though they 'd gone around the lhc a few billion times . <sssss> hands down five out of five .
LOW		one of our long-time employees was leaving the company -lrb- after about 15 years -rrb- so a decent-sized group of us came to fez for a send-off lunch yesterday . <sssss> i myself had suggested it to the event decision-maker , but had never been before - i just know that it 's had a lot of good reviews , the pics of the menu items on yelp looked tasty and it 's only a few blocks from where i work . <sssss> tl ; dr : i was n't impressed . <sssss> details as follows : most of my coworkers would n't know flavour if it kicked them in the face , so out of about 14 people , quite predictably the all american burger was the most popular choice . <sssss> might as well have all gone to jack in the box instead and saved 50 % , but whatever . <sssss> i decided to grab a large basket of garlic and rosemary fries to share with the three at my end of the table , and -lrb- unusually for me -rrb- chose a salad as an entree . <sssss> i selected the barcelona butterleaf salad . <sssss> the fries were pretty good , nothing mindblowing , but the salad was below par . <sssss> i was n't after anything fancy , but the nuts were not candied like shown on the menu , they were just plain cashews - and the salad was absolutely fucking drenched in the dressing . <sssss> as in , so much that the lettuce was wilted and i was wincing with each mouthful toward the end because of the extreme vinegary zing . <sssss> they could have gotten away with a quarter of the amount they put on . <sssss> i thought that some pickled beet might be nice on the salad and asked if that was an ingredient they could provide . <sssss> nope . <sssss> i asked a workmate what he thought of his blue cheese burger . <sssss> he had asked them for a couple of pepperoncinis - again , nada . <sssss> they offered him chili pepper flakes instead . <sssss> basically he told me that it was okay but the meat lacked flavour . <sssss> nobody at our table seemed particularly overjoyed . <sssss> as for me , i do n't think i 'd want to eat a burger with ciabatta bread . <sssss> how about a sesame seed bun instead ? <sssss> too traditional - for an all american burger ? <sssss> evidently . <sssss> this is yet another place that imposes a mandatory tip for large parties - that tip , of course , is your penalty for bringing more clientele into the establishment and forcing the restaurant to make just that much more money . <sssss> because it sure was n't to ensure that all meals were served at the same time to the guests . <sssss> one of our guys had to wait several minutes for his burger to come out . <sssss> three stars , and i probably wo n't be back - not as long as there are places like pho thanh in the vicinity where you can get double the taste and double the amount of chow for half the price . <sssss> not for a place with this level of mediocrity . <sssss> seventeen bucks for a shit salad and about ten fries - god i wish pork on a fork , greek wraps and indian paradise were n't 20 min drives away .
HIG		just had lunch here . <sssss> another great experience - you pretty much ca n't go wrong at claim jumper . <sssss> i 'm not a major salad buff by any stretch of the imagination , but i did n't want to fill up on anything so i went for one of their salads and man was i glad i did . <sssss> i got the goat cheese and beet salad - walnuts , beets , mixed dark greens , papaya , cherry tomatoes in a citrus sauce with goat cheese . <sssss> the cheese pretty much amounted to a tiny bit of sprinkles on top of the salad , but that did n't matter because it pretty much became my favourite salad of all time today after only having it once . <sssss> highest praise i can give to a dish basically . <sssss> the yelp app failed to lock my location so i could n't do a checkin ; apart from that , a five star visit . <sssss> no idea why the yelp info shows this place as being in scottsdale though . <sssss> it 's n phoenix , at the 101 and i-17 . <sssss> submitted biz change to have this corrected . <sssss> -lrb- i was wondering why the cj 's did n't show up on my yelp app on the cellphone for checkin ; now i know . <sssss> . <sssss> -rrb-
MID		not a bad place at all . <sssss> it 's also reasonably new . <sssss> up until a couple of months ago my office was a quarter mile from this place . <sssss> i 'd passed the sign a couple of times and gave it a shot one evening . <sssss> prior to trying tt2 , i 'd been a regular at maharaja 's palace -lrb- pretty much on the diagonally opposite -lsb- sw -rsb- corner of 57th ave -rrb- , and if you like you can read my review of the latter to see why i wo n't eat there anymore . <sssss> i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at tt2 . <sssss> it 's a little more expensive but the food appears to be of higher quality . <sssss> basically the naan is the freshest/tastiest i 've had in the us . <sssss> unfortunately they 're light on beef dishes -lrb- probably because the moo cow is held in higher regard than people are back in india ? <sssss> -rrb- and i missed things like beef saag and vindaloo , but everything else is real good . <sssss> they have `` chaat '' on the weekends - kinda like the indian equivalent of spanish tapas ? <sssss> - but there are several items on this particular menu that are n't available during the week and that 's a bit strange . <sssss> lunch specials are pretty good . <sssss> there 's a different main dish each day and they serve quite an acceptable portion of rice , that dish , salad and raita . <sssss> unfortunately most of the guys in my office are phoenix-born and for some reason they consider indian food to be anathema -lrb- i 've literally gotten laughed at when i proposed this place once as a lunch destination -rrb- and thus i typically do n't have too many lunch partners when i 've eaten here . <sssss> then again these are the same guys who 'll eat the most wretched mexican slop i 've ever gagged on in my life . <sssss> . <sssss> day after day , over and over and over . <sssss> . <sssss> but i digress . <sssss> . <sssss> one black mark against this place , they are n't open on mondays . <sssss> it 's monday today and i 'd kill for some indian for dinner so that totally sucks . <sssss> anywhere that is n't open 7 days a week really needs to reevaluate . <sssss> fortunately i can cook the stuff at home - that 's when i have three hours to spare . <sssss> . <sssss> summary : it 's far from the best indian restaurant that i 've eaten at , but it 's the best in phoenix that i 've found -lrb- admittedly , i have n't tried anything on the east side yet . <sssss> . <sssss> * 8 - -rrb-
LOW		hooray ! <sssss> one of my two fondest wishes for surprise has come true - a vietnamese restaurant ! <sssss> now all we need is an indian restaurant and i can quit being pissed off that i committed to owning two houses in this boring little section of phoenix . <sssss> tried it out this evening with the wife and kid . <sssss> she was a little hesitant because she does n't really go for vietnamese , but i 'm a pho fiend and when i learned that we have one of these places locally i had to go see . <sssss> first impression of the place : it 's very neat and clean - to be expected since it 's pretty new . <sssss> they 're going for a scottsdaley urban vibe or something , i guess . <sssss> . <sssss> bar/stool area plus tables which overall reminded me of tokyo lobby a little further down bell . <sssss> not a bad thing as long as the grub measures up too , such as is the case at vogue bistro . <sssss> the wait staff were very attentive . <sssss> a little too attentive , actually - we were pinged about six or seven times while we ate by two separate waiters , but of course that 's better than being ignored . <sssss> customer feedback # 1 - refill the glasses automatically without interrupting our conversation to ask , please . <sssss> as always , i ordered the pho dac biet -lrb- special beef and noodle soup -rrb- . <sssss> the wife had the saigon rice -lrb- bbq pork , carrot , pea , shrimp -lsb- she asked for no shrimp , though -rsb- , rice and egg -rrb- and shared it with our toddler . <sssss> she also had the spring rolls . <sssss> i hate those things , they always remind me of intestines filled with worms for some reason . <sssss> but anyway . <sssss> the kid , after a little coaxing , had some rice , noodles -lrb- extracted from the guts of one of the spring rolls -rrb- and satay sauce . <sssss> he did n't mind it . <sssss> wife ate her fill and also did n't mind it . <sssss> my pho was hot and tasty but i have some criticisms . <sssss> positives first : it was piping hot , the broth was very tasty -lrb- marrow bones boiled longer in it , or perhaps more beef stock ? <sssss> -rrb- , they served lemon pieces instead of lime -lrb- listen carefully , other vietnamese places : there 's a difference , and lemon is - better - -rrb- and i did n't have to beg/gesticulate for a fork . <sssss> now for the low points . <sssss> dac biet should be served with flank , tendon , brisket and tripe . <sssss> there was absolutely no tripe in my soup . <sssss> i fished for a while , then asked one of the wait staff , who advised that they do not include tripe in that dish . <sssss> fail . <sssss> not a big fail , but what i 'll call a `` bombay spice '' fail -lrb- those people who have been to bombay spice in paradise valley expecting ` actual ' indian restaurant fare will know exactly what i mean here -rrb- . <sssss> customer feedback # 2 : serve your pho dac biet with tripe and let customers dictate whether or not you should continue doing so , rather than the other way round . <sssss> second , i got a measly palmful of bean sprouts on one of those long square plates , hardly enough for a single bite . <sssss> third , instead of a bottle of sriracha hot sauce on the table there was a doll 's - house-sized dollop of it on a tiny square dish . <sssss> now , i do n't actually put sriracha in my soup , but everyone else i know does so it 's a valid point for analysis afaic . <sssss> yes , i know i could have asked for more sprouts and in hindsight maybe i should have , since otherwise how would they know about the fails ? <sssss> and finally , just aesthetics - at the beginning of the meal i was forking around in the bottom of the bowl looking for some noodles , did n't find them , then seconds later realised why - the noodles were all clustered on the other side of the bowl in a huge semi-stuck-together wad , basically as though they had been emptied out of the packet as a brick of vermicelli and then not stirred at all as they were boiled . <sssss> i soon separated them with my fork . <sssss> $ 9 for a large pho dac biet that was missing a traditional ingredient . <sssss> not a spectacular price considering what i got . <sssss> i was still hungry and had to mow down on my wife 's leftovers before i was satiated . <sssss> so to speak . <sssss> my favourite vietnamese in the valley is still 43rd express -lrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz/43rd-express-phoenix -rrb- at 43rd ave and thomas . <sssss> go try a bowl of their pho and see what you get for your dollar . <sssss> saigon kitchen gets three stars flat . <sssss> nice and average in the scheme of things , with cold stone creamery next door being a definite plus . <sssss> i am judging them based on the other vn restaurants i 've eaten at across the entirety of phx . <sssss> i 'm certainly not going to especially fawn over the place because it 's a zillion miles closer to me than the nearest other vn restaurant . <sssss> but , i 'll definitely return and we 'll see whether they improve over time . <sssss> i got an extra star in my pocket just for them if they do . <sssss> very pleasant decor , completely unexpected for a place that serves this kind of cuisine . <sssss> usually you got linoleum , plastic tables and a coupla dead roaches in the corners . <sssss> for the moment , in order : 43rd express , avina 's , nam sao and then here . <sssss> i 'm kinda glad they censored my review of 43rd express , actually . <sssss> i really like that place , it 's just that i wrote my review after travelling 20 mins to get there only to find it closed . <sssss> . <sssss> on a tuesday . <sssss> anyway . <sssss> i 'll quit waffling now .
MID		okay . <sssss> i 'm a huge fan of greek and other mediterranean foods . <sssss> when i saw this place and all the five star reviews , of course i figured it was worth checking out -lrb- despite it being next door to chino bandido - i still shudder when i think about how severe the food poisoning was that my wife and i got from that place a couple of years ago -rrb- . <sssss> before i begin , this review started at 3 stars in my mind , went up to four and then back down to three . <sssss> explanation follows . <sssss> as with so many other yelpers , i was immediately greeted upon entering the -lrb- empty at the time -rrb- establishment by a man who i assume was ninos - and so for the rest of this review that 's what i 'll call him -lrb- even if it was n't actually ninos -rrb- . <sssss> because this week i returned to my as-vegetarian-and-low-carb-as-possible diet , i was after something like falafels or dolmas for lunch . <sssss> ninos saw me looking at the menu and offered some suggestions . <sssss> i asked for some sort of vegetarian type thing , like perhaps a platter , and he said he could actually design something for me - falafel on a bed of hummus . <sssss> i thought of perhaps a little tabbouleh to go with it and he said it might not be able to do that , then ducked into the kitchen briefly - seconds later he reappeared with another dude and they both greenlighted the tabbouleh . <sssss> the dolmas could have been part of my meal too , but i was advised that these are made to order and i figured i did n't need them that bad . <sssss> we went with a custom order of falafel , tabbouleh and hummus . <sssss> ninos also asked if i liked eggplant , then said he could offer me a small sample of eggplant and potato on the house , which i gratefully accepted . <sssss> finally , while i was waiting , ninos offered me a bowl of lentil soup . <sssss> at this point , despite the fact that i 'm not really into soup -lrb- especially in the phoenix summertime -rrb- i mentally raised my rating of good fellas to 4 stars . <sssss> the soup was hot as hell , and not too bad -lrb- as lentil soups go -rrb- . <sssss> seems to me that it 's more of a wintertime dish , but i 'm no soup connoisseur . <sssss> several other people started arriving at the lunch hour and then my food was ready . <sssss> ninos opened the container to show me . <sssss> a standard flat square takeout container with the main course , and a housebrick-sized one with tabbouleh -lrb- which was pretty much enough tabbouleh to feed at least four people - way more than i was after -rrb- . <sssss> main here -lrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cv0knwcfa-x-8jjhot6few?select=vxmx9i2vaxpywg5k795tmg -rrb- , tabbouleh here -lrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cv0knwcfa-x-8jjhot6few?select=ituzq7ab-acpyibdxafcra -rrb- . <sssss> the total price came to just over $ 16 . <sssss> later on , mulling over this fact is what reduced my final rating . <sssss> very much overpriced for what i was after - double my typical lunch cost . <sssss> taste-wise : the hummus was very nice and creamy , better than most i 've had . <sssss> the falafels , as you can see from the photo , looked like mini donuts . <sssss> strange , but also very nice - did not taste like the store-mix stuff -lrb- reminiscent of wet beach sand -rrb- that you find in falafels from places like chicago gyros or jt gyros . <sssss> tabbouleh was good , but there was simply too much of it . <sssss> this was supposed to be lunch for one person ; i had to discard more than 3/4 of the t. finally , the eggplant and potato was nice and reminded me of the ep/spicy potato/tzatziki/lettuce / tomato/cheese kebabs that i used to get from saidoun in north sydney shoppingworld 's food court . <sssss> back when it existed , that is . <sssss> the price was somewhat my fault , i suppose , for not ordering directly from the menu nor indicating my desired quantity . <sssss> breaking it down : greek wraps give you two falafels for a buck ; six would have been three bucks . <sssss> hummus ; i can get almost double the amount for about $ 3.99 from fry 's , albeit perhaps not as fresh . <sssss> tabbouleh is cilantro , parsley , bulgur wheat and a coupla other cheap things . <sssss> i would have been happy with far less of it and a price of perhaps $ 8-9 all up . <sssss> ninos rang up several items on the register so i think he may have believed that i got multiple full-size entrees items but my photos show what i received -lrb- minus the eggplant -rrb- . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> i 'll return for sure and next time i 'll bring a few workmates . <sssss> props to ninos for being personable and willing to cater for his customers , and for the above average flavor of the food . <sssss> and thanks to google i now know why the falafels are shaped like donuts - to prevent getting mealy in the middle . <sssss> neat idea . <sssss> i 'll try a meat dish next time ; there could well be a fourth star yet in good fellas ' future . <sssss> .
HIG		went to poaf for lunch today . <sssss> ordered the smokin meal with bbq beans , sweet potato fries and spicy sausage . <sssss> came with a pickle spear , and i also got a small container of their hot sauce . <sssss> damn good meal for ~ $ 10 . <sssss> probably some of the best bbq i 've had , although the meat was kinda fatty . <sssss> loved the pulled pork . <sssss> wondered what the yellowish slug-like bits in the sausage were then realised that they were chunks of cheese . <sssss> this is going to have to be a rare treat for me , i probably threw down more than twice my entire daily calorie limit in a single meal , but it 's nothing a bit of furious pedalling on my exercise bike wo n't rectify . <sssss> i hope . <sssss> five stars for the food . <sssss> yelp also has a checkin deal - three checkins nets you $ 5 off your meal . <sssss> that could be more than half your meal 's cost , depending on what you get . <sssss> i 'm one down so far .
LOW		absolutely unimpressive . <sssss> went here for lunch yesterday with a couple of workmates . <sssss> which was a tuesday - a day on which , inexplicably , all other vietnamese restaurants in the area are closed - so at least this was an initial point in their favour . <sssss> if you 've read my other vietnamese restaurant reviews you 'll know that i only ever eat pho -lrb- dac biet -rrb- and was planning to order that here . <sssss> eyes popped out of my head when i saw that they charge $ 10 for a bowl ! <sssss> there also were n't different sizes for the dish , so i guessed -lrb- correctly , as it turns out -rrb- that they only had a small size . <sssss> still , i decided to give it a shot . <sssss> i also noticed that their menu was extremely limited - there were almost more varieties of spring roll , which i hate , than pretty much any other food category . <sssss> the waiter told us that they were famous for their rolls . <sssss> . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> i got the pho . <sssss> it was a small size . <sssss> of course . <sssss> in fact , the amount of pho in the bowl was positively pissant . <sssss> within maybe five minutes i had finished it off completely and was still quite hungry . <sssss> and just like saigon kitchen in surprise , they served a small fistful of bean sprouts , some pathetic wilted basil , and a couple of tiny slices of lime . <sssss> basically a kids-meal-sized amount of garnish . <sssss> oh , and a tiny dish with nothing on it -lrb- arguably to contain sauce , though there was no sriracha or anything else on the table -rrb- . <sssss> the broth was almost tasteless and there were no tendon pieces at all . <sssss> trust me , i looked hard . <sssss> i spent the next ten minutes fishing forlornly , and mostly unsuccessfully , for strands of noodles at the bottom of the broth . <sssss> they had a telly showing the olympics above the bar . <sssss> unfortunately , half the communal dining benches face the opposite direction so i had to watch sally pearson take gold in the women 's 100m hurdles in an ornate mirror . <sssss> that was the high point of the experience . <sssss> they then gave us the wrong bill , which was presented as a receipt pinned to a small block with a cheap wooden clothespeg . <sssss> might as well have printed it on a sheet of sh1tter paper too . <sssss> wo n't be going back . <sssss> barely got two stars . <sssss> i 'm happy to wait out the `` vietnamese weekend '' - ie tuesday - in future , and grab a bowl of pho that 's twice the size and thrice the flavour for three bucks cheaper at pho thanh , da vang , maxim or 43rd express . <sssss> if you like spring rolls , knock yourself out . <sssss> if you like pho , freakin ' avoid this place like the plague . <sssss> remember , new india bazaar is a couple hundred yards down the road , and they have all you can eat - and all the flavour you need - for $ 8 . <sssss> i could n't agree more with matthew k - the value is way out of line .
MID		went back here for lunch today . <sssss> it was my second time -lrb- first time was last week -rrb- and this time i brought my boss along . <sssss> the last time they did n't have their supreme master sh1te on , and this time both tellys were blank . <sssss> disappointed , i actually asked whether they could put it on after reading some of the reviews on here , just to have a bit of a laugh . <sssss> on it came . <sssss> it 's not that bad - there was some asian woman getting laughs from an audience , evidently the opening act for the supreme master himself . <sssss> it all comes from california , apparently - why does n't this surprise me ? <sssss> we chuckled for a bit -lrb- mainly at how rapidly the subtitles and other stuff were flashing on the screen , almost like max headroom blipverts -rrb- then turned to our food . <sssss> i got the pho with their golden rolls , the boss got a bowl of curry with a side of brown rice served in the traditional way -lrb- bowl up and over -rrb- . <sssss> all it needed was a hershey 's chocolate kiss on the top and it would have looked just like a tit . <sssss> anyway . <sssss> the pho was actually pretty good - they made a fine job out of cloning standard pho dac biet , even to the extent of having some gristly stuff that simulated tripe . <sssss> the `` meat '' was pretty good - i too was really surprised that it looked and tasted so close to regular meat . <sssss> the boss liked his stuff as well . <sssss> a touch on the expensive side -lrb- veggie stuff should be just a little cheaper than eight bucks a pop , which is what some of their entrees cost -rrb- but on the whole it 's pretty tasty stuff . <sssss> and the people in there are sort of amusing . <sssss> i ordered my pho and the guy goes `` whoa , that 'll taste really good '' . <sssss> . <sssss> i told him i usually went for the dac biet and he was like . <sssss> . <sssss> `` yeah yeah , this is just as good . <sssss> . <sssss> except . <sssss> . <sssss> better . '' <sssss> i said that i was expecting to become a supreme master after eating it or else i was going to be asking for my money back . <sssss> the little old server lady was very nice ; she saw me eating rolls with my fingers and dropped off some chopsticks for me so i did n't get ketchupy paws . <sssss> so in summary : good food , seemed like a clean place , reasonably unique menu , fairly non-confrontational television propaganda , not overcrowded , priced as something that could make it a weekly treat for me , and cholesterol free to boot .
LOW		the quality vs value of this place has completely plummetted in recent times and i had a very disappointing visit a few weeks ago . <sssss> i had met a couple of friends for lunch who had never been here before . <sssss> told them that it was one of the best soul food places i 've ever been to , which at time of stating had been quite true . <sssss> i 've been coming here for about seven or eight years and i remember when the food used to cost $ 8.80 per plate - and after your meal someone was always walking around offering the dessert of the day to everyone . <sssss> quaint and tasty and decently priced . <sssss> now , everything is almost double that , over $ 14 per plate . <sssss> and the flavours have gone downhill . <sssss> i told these guys the cornbread at mrs white 's was all-world . <sssss> out comes stale shitty cornbread that i guarantee was made the previous day - we got there at just after 11am so i know it was n't fresh . <sssss> one of my friends asked for mac and cheese , they did n't have it . <sssss> also did n't have red beans and rice , which is what i normally order . <sssss> um , ok . <sssss> i asked for smothered chicken . <sssss> the other two asked for fried chicken . <sssss> out come three plates of fried chicken . <sssss> i was too hungry to care . <sssss> then the guy comes out and says they do have mac and cheese . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> collard greens are n't flavourful at all - almost like something steamed out of a green giant freezer pack . <sssss> fried chicken was okay , but not anything better than church 's and three times the price . <sssss> and nobody offered any dessert , not that we would have had it anyway . <sssss> the bill for all three of us came to $ 48 !! <sssss> for basically something i could have cobbled together myself and i 'm not even kidding . <sssss> kraft mac and cheese would have been tastier . <sssss> fried chicken takes a little while but is n't rocket science . <sssss> collard greens are a twenty-five cent side , and i almost broke my tooth on the cornbread . <sssss> this place went from a treat to a disaster in one horrible visit . <sssss> wo n't be back unless and until they literally halve their prices and go back to the quality hole-in-the-wall they used to be . <sssss> at least they accept credit cards now - only took them a half century to figure that out . <sssss> and to top it off , their website is just as jacked up as their prices . <sssss> 2 stars .
MID		headed downtown to the soon-to-be-new-office with the boss today and had lunch here - he 's lived in phx for decades and recommended this place -lrb- although he had n't been there in many years -rrb- . <sssss> i got a super sicilian . <sssss> absolutely delicious - the sesame bread looked like it would be hard/crunchy but it was soft and tasty . <sssss> if i had to offer up any criticisms it would be 1 -rrb- the fact that it inexplicably took something like 10 mins to make our sandwich - it just looked like it had been toasted , nothing else i could think of should have made it take that long , and 2 -rrb- the sandwich was too small * 8 - -rrb- my mistake , of course . <sssss> i got a whole , and could easily have downed two of those . <sssss> taste wise it 's equivalent imo to the `` all-american grinder '' at uncle sam 's , except with the latter you can also get jalapenos . <sssss> will definitely return here once our office shifts downtown , but next time i 'll get a sub and a half , methinks ! <sssss> ps : parking ? <sssss> the boss just parked his ram 2500hd and toy trailer around the corner on the street in front of someone 's house . <sssss> no problem and no parking meters . <sssss> -lrb- shrug -rrb-
LOW		as i have mentioned in a couple of my other reviews , i am not a big fan of burgers . <sssss> however , after a good experience at smashburger i figured maybe i could enjoy if they are done right . <sssss> a friend had kept wanting to try this place so i finally gave in . <sssss> my thoughts ? <sssss> meh . <sssss> i was completely underwhelmed by this place . <sssss> i love their fries . <sssss> it 's the only thing i have had there before and those are still good . <sssss> the burger though ? <sssss> no flavor ... i asked for it minus the arugula -lrb- not a fan of the stuff -rrb- and i realized after i had left disappointed that they also managed to leave the bacon off . <sssss> i certainly did n't ask for that . <sssss> if that had been on there it might have been a little better . <sssss> but even then i do n't think it would have been a good burger . <sssss> if someone talks me in to going here again i will likely just stick with the fries . <sssss> get the combination basket , half sweet potato and half regular .
LOW		meh ... that about sums up my thoughts on the grind . <sssss> not great , not terrible . <sssss> i enjoyed the decor . <sssss> the burgers are huge . <sssss> a group of 4 of us went in for a special they were having so we all had to have the blt burger . <sssss> maybe if i had been able to pick a different burger this review might be different , but the blt burger just did n't have much flavor . <sssss> the fries were tasty . <sssss> asked for some orange slices to come with my beer to sweeten it up but they never came . <sssss> my boyfriend had to go up to the bar to ask for them . <sssss> when the bill came it was originally incorrect but they eventually fixed it to slightly better than the original special . <sssss> i say eventually because once the waitress dropped off the bill it took her forever to come back . <sssss> and it was a slow night so it was not due to other tables , so like i said ... some good , some bad . <sssss> overall just meh ... -lrb- full disclosure - i am not a big fan of burgers in general . <sssss> my boyfriend is though and he felt the same about the burger . <sssss> -rrb-
MID		i was really on the fence if i should give this review 3 or 4 stars . <sssss> stopped in yesterday for the s'mores milkshake . <sssss> this was my first visit to beckett 's table and i 've been wanting to try it ever since i heard a review about their chocolate covered bacon ! <sssss> the chocolate covered bacon is served as part of their s'mores dessert . <sssss> for arizona dairy month they have made this dessert into a milkshake . <sssss> the milkshake was tasty but just ok in my opinion . <sssss> i think it had one or two too many flavors going on for my preference . <sssss> it had the standard s'mores ingredients of marshmallow , chocolate , graham crackers and also had an addition of bacon , caramel and peanut butter . <sssss> i think if the peanut butter had been left out it would have been way better ! <sssss> -lrb- i like peanut butter but it just seemed to take away from the other delicious flavors instead of add to them . <sssss> -rrb- the part of the shake i was looking forward to the most was the chocolate covered bacon ! <sssss> sadly , the piece that came with the shake tasted burnt . <sssss> -lrb- this coming from someone who likes their bacon very well done ! <sssss> -rrb- but when we mentioned it to our server he was very nice and brought us out two more pieces of chocolate covered bacon to make up for it . <sssss> and those ones tasted better . <sssss> = -rrb- speaking of the service ... it was great . <sssss> this is the reason for the 4 stars . <sssss> the atmosphere is lovely . <sssss> they are very attentive on filling up your water glass and making sure you enjoyed everything . <sssss> it was great till the end , when we wanted to get our check ... which took a while . <sssss> but i do n't hold that against them ... our server seemed to have too many tables to look after . <sssss> i hope to stop in again to try their food when i have more time .
MID		my mom and i went back recently and i have to give them kudos for turning up the steam room . <sssss> it was great this time . <sssss> just the right amout of steam ! <sssss> and the staff is so very friendly . <sssss> it is still not the same as a resort spa , but that is ok so long as that is not what you are expecting .
HIG		this is a grocery store like i have never seen before ! <sssss> valet parking or covered spaces for those that park themselves . <sssss> once your inside you almost forget you are in a fry 's . <sssss> feels more like a high end whole foods or aj 's , but still with fry 's prices . <sssss> too bad it was n't closer to home . <sssss> i would n't mind filling up my cart here more often .
MID		best martini i have ever had ! <sssss> i have tried a few different ones on the super long list to choose from but triple chocolate is my favorite ! <sssss> they give you the martini glass and the shaker . <sssss> this is great for two reasons . <sssss> one - you get more martini than can possibly fit in one glass . <sssss> two - they do n't fill it to the brim so you can actually walk around with your martini glass without spilling and wasting the delicious beverage . <sssss> make sure when you are leaving you ask for a true blue lady vip card . <sssss> -lrb- if you are a lady that is ... -rrb- next time you go , just show your card at the door and you get a ticket which is good for your first martini on the house . <sssss> a free $ 12 delicious martini ? <sssss> yes , please !!! <sssss> the food here is tasty . <sssss> the flatbreads are good . <sssss> so is the spinach dip . <sssss> they do play the music a bit too loud in the bar for happy hour . <sssss> it makes it hard to hear the person right next to you . <sssss> so just sip your martini and people watch .
MID		went here for lunch the other day with a friend . <sssss> the food was yum ! <sssss> the portions were generous . <sssss> service was great . <sssss> our server 's name was blake and he was just sweet as can be . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back and try it for happy hour because i have heard good things .
MID		i really like this place . <sssss> the black bean burrito is great ! <sssss> good portions . <sssss> if you order in you get complimentary chips and salsa . <sssss> quick service . <sssss> fun decor . <sssss> the reason for the deduction of one star is because the place often seems like cleaning supplies . <sssss> i appreciate that they try to keep the place clean but please try to do it at the end of the day or get less strong smelling products . <sssss> it 's not the most appetizing smell . <sssss> i do n't want to feel like i am eating my burrito with a side of windex , i would rather smell my food .
MID		this place is great.super nice service , wifi and comfortable chairs to curl up in . <sssss> these things make it a great place to great some homework done . <sssss> plus their soup is very delish .
MID		this is one of my favorite happy hour spots on mill . <sssss> they have the best chambord margarita 's ! <sssss> be careful though ... they are strong . <sssss> another must order item on the menu is the tejas trio .
LOW		i really struggled with how many stars i should give this review . <sssss> i went here with my mom for a spa day a couple weeks ago . <sssss> we enjoyed our day but the facilities are just ok . <sssss> the reason i gave it three stars is because the girl who did my facial was great . <sssss> i think her name was leah ?? <sssss> hopefully i am right . <sssss> she was lovely . <sssss> the steam room was just ok . <sssss> the steam is preset to go off at regular intervals but for my taste the intervals were just way to far apart . <sssss> towards the end of the cycle i felt more like i was in a hot yoga studio , not a steam room . <sssss> and i love steam rooms so i was a little disappointed . <sssss> but even the quality of the steam room needs some updating . <sssss> several tiles are cracked . <sssss> one side of the steam room is a constant puddle due to the inconsistency in the floor . <sssss> i tired not to step over there because water that never drains just seems like an invitation for bacteria . <sssss> there was also some white substance in spots on the wall that i am not sure what it is . <sssss> leftover soap not rinsed off , growth , i do n't know ? <sssss> the pool and hot tub area are basic . <sssss> they have some big trees overhead so i try to give some benefit of the doubt with all the leaves in the pool . <sssss> however , it is much harder to overlook the edges of the pool and hot tub that just seemed grimy . <sssss> i think the pool service might need to scrub the edges a little more often . <sssss> i wo n't go in to extensive detail on everything because i do n't want to feel like i am beating them up . <sssss> it is a nice place . <sssss> it just maybe needs a little more attention to detail , cleanliness and some updating . <sssss> i would recommend getting a facial here . <sssss> however , i would recommend going with realistic expectations . <sssss> this is not going to be as nice as one of our local spas but it is a nice way to spend the day .
MID		this is a great spot for brunch ! <sssss> i definitely recommend sitting on the patio , as it can be quite loud inside . <sssss> the food is delicious . <sssss> i love the french toast . <sssss> they make great coffee and a strong cocktail . <sssss> service can be hit or miss .
LOW		oddly enough i had never been to a bison witches location before last week and then i ended up visiting the tempe and tucson locations within a couple days of each other . <sssss> my impression at both ... fussy wait staff and not particularly attentive . <sssss> i already reviewed tucson , so this review will just be about tempe . <sssss> a group of friends went there for happy hour . <sssss> it took me a while to get our servers attention to order a drink . <sssss> when i did get to place my order she was n't familiar with the specials . <sssss> i was told something was on happy hour but turned out it was n't . <sssss> so when she came back to tell me i picked another choice . <sssss> my boyfriend was stuck working late so i asked if i could order a happy hour beer for him . <sssss> the waitress said no because she would need to see his id . <sssss> i understand it is tempe but come on , really ? <sssss> i did n't have to tell the truth ... i guess i should have just ordered it instead of asking . <sssss> we were not a table of college kids , it was a table full of adults . <sssss> i told her his age and said she is more than welcome to check his id when he gets there . <sssss> she seemed annoyed but finally agreed . <sssss> she would n't bring it out till he got there . <sssss> that was fine by me since that means he would get a cold beer instead of a warm one . <sssss> then when he did get there it took a while to get her back to the table to let her know he was there . <sssss> a friend did order the broccoli soup in the bread bowl . <sssss> i got to have a taste and it was pretty good . <sssss> i just was n't particularly impressed with this place . <sssss> and with so many great options on mill for happy hour , i am not sure i will return .
HIG		wow , costco has self checkout now . <sssss> at least this one does . <sssss> love it !!
LOW		i was not a particular fan of this place . <sssss> went on a friday evening after work . <sssss> a friend wanted to try it because we always enjoy supporting new , local places . <sssss> they do have a very large selections of beer but the process is very confusing . <sssss> all of the beers on tap are written on a very large chalkboard above the bar . <sssss> they use several different colors of chalk for each selection making it very hard to read . <sssss> it may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer , that way it is easy to find what you want . <sssss> or have # 1-5 be one type of beer , # 6-10 another and so on . <sssss> my boyfriend spent so long trying to find a beer on the board because of this . <sssss> two of our friends were so overwhelmed with the way the selections were presented they just asked the server to surprise them with a choice . <sssss> the acoustics in the place are terrible . <sssss> it was so loud inside that it was hard to carry on a conversation at the table . <sssss> also , no happy hour . <sssss> this would be a great way to draw in an after work crowd .
LOW		it 's been a while since i have been here but i stopped in with mom the other day , so i figured now is a good time to give it a review . <sssss> decent pizza . <sssss> i like the thin crust . <sssss> this is a thin crust pizza that needs to be eaten with a fork and knife . <sssss> not crispy enough to pick up . <sssss> the servers were very affectionate . <sssss> by that i mean they called my mom babe and me love . <sssss> i thought maybe it was just our server until i heard the server at the next table refer to her diners as sweetie and hun . <sssss> not a bad thing at all . <sssss> just kind of funny . <sssss> and sweet . <sssss> = -rrb- so if you are looking for someone to call you sweet nicknames while eating good pizza this is the place for you !
MID		i went here for lunch the other day and really enjoyed my meal . <sssss> i ordered the elephant garlic lunch plate . <sssss> it was definitely very garlicky , which i loved ! <sssss> many times when i order something with garlic in the name , i am disappointed to find it not true to the name . <sssss> this place lived up to it 's name and that makes this garlic girl happy ! <sssss> they ask you how spicy you want your meal . <sssss> i went with medium . <sssss> that was perfect for eating it there -lrb- with the exception of one really hot bite , yikes ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> but i did have leftovers , thanks to the good size portion . <sssss> the heat definitely intensifies in the leftovers !!! <sssss> so unless you plan on finishing or sharing your meal , you may want to opt for slightly lower heat setting so that your leftovers do n't knock your socks off . <sssss> i was not a fan of the soup they give you at the beginning . <sssss> the service was just ok .
MID		we recently went to yelp 's ultimate pley date ! <sssss> and received a couple coupons to zoe 's . <sssss> i 'm really glad we did ! <sssss> i tried this place when it first opened but have n't returned because i am not particularly a fan of greek food . <sssss> so i was very pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it . <sssss> = -rrb- perry was behind the counter when we went in and she was so friendly and helpful ! <sssss> she helped with some recommendations . <sssss> i ended up getting a grilled chicken pasta and my boyfriend got the chicken kabobs . <sssss> both were very tasty .
HIG		i love , love , love cibo ! <sssss> i know it has tons of great reviews but i feel it is time to add my own . <sssss> in my opinion cibo is better than pizzeria bianco and way less wait . <sssss> this is a great place for sharing . <sssss> my favorite night at cibo goes like this ... the delicious pesto salad . <sssss> -lrb- i am not usually a big salad person but this one is quite interesting . <sssss> -rrb- then on to the pizza . <sssss> i generally get the margherita pizza but had the diavola the other day and now i am hooked . <sssss> for desert all of the crepes are amazing . <sssss> and if you 've never had limoncello i highly recommend you try it ! <sssss> and of course you can always share a bottle of wine for dinner . <sssss> great food , reasonable prices and beautiful patio !
MID		i have been eager to try this place for a while and we finally went here for dinner the other night . <sssss> it is a small restaurant with a nice charm . <sssss> although , for the prices i would expect a little fancier atmosphere . <sssss> for dinner we ordered the fuego seafood chile relleno . <sssss> the dish was tasty with a bit a kick . <sssss> since most of the dish was spicy it was served with a side of candied cabbage . <sssss> i 've never had that before ... it was quite interesting and a fun contrast to the spiciness of everything else . <sssss> i ordered the dragonberry mojito . <sssss> they have awards for their mojito 's so i was expecting a lot . <sssss> it was good but i would have preferred a little less mint and a little more dragonberry . <sssss> but it was still good . <sssss> overall i enjoyed the experience and am glad i finally got to try it .
HIG		i love bringing newbies to a place i know they are going to truly love . <sssss> such was tonight . <sssss> first , our watier , shawn , was amazing . <sssss> our guest likes to have the waiter pick their favorites for him and shawn stepped up to the plate ! <sssss> we started with my recommendation of the creamy , mouth-watering bone marrow . <sssss> but shawn 's pick , the green chili pork papusa was the table favorite . <sssss> then came the entrees . <sssss> i had a tender flat iron steak , my hubby had the trout , our kids had the flat iron steak and the pork belly and our guest had the sand dabs . <sssss> all of us were happy with our picks but most of all , we loved our sides . <sssss> we pushed them all in the middle of the table so we could share . <sssss> i had baby beets that were topped with an amazing sprinkle of cilantro , jalepeno and cashews , hubby had a roasted cauliflower with a curry sauce that melted in our mouths but shawn 's pick was the favorite of the table - dates with goat cheese and a sweet vinagrette that popped in your mouth when you took a swig of red wine -lrb- az stronghold magnus on tap - way to support our local wineries ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> next came a round of shots with infused fruit in the middle . <sssss> nice touch ! <sssss> then came the desserts and we were all very quiet as we ate . <sssss> i also do n't remember anyone wanting to share . <sssss> from a tantallizing , sweet creme brulee with banana , frozen raspberry , pretzel ice cream to shawn 's pick of navel orange sorbet doused with liquid nitrogen ... the presentation was incredible . <sssss> suffice it to say , this was an incredible experience ... we loved shawn . <sssss> and we ca n't wait to come back to try sunday brunch , lunch or just sit up at the bar . <sssss> the staff is so nice , we would just want sit and drink and relax . <sssss> we will be back !
HIG		omg ... i 'll start at the beginning . <sssss> waiting at the bar at this cute little house -lrb- used to be sophie 's bistro -rrb- for the maceachern 's to arrive . <sssss> our bartender , rachel , was so helpful , knowledgeable , cute , had us try litte cherry bomb shooters ... shots of vodka with a little cherry drop inside that explodes in your mouth . <sssss> their signature drinks were amazing as well . <sssss> thanks , rachel ! <sssss> then on to our table with our wonderful waitress , jessica . <sssss> all i can say is , we sat outside on this beautiful evening trying the most outlandish , unique , savory dishes . <sssss> first they bring you home made biscuits with honey butter . <sssss> then we shared thrice fried fries -lrb- say that five times fast -rrb- with three dipping sauces and -lrb- are you ready -rrb- garlic toast dipped in bone marrow -lrb- t was buttery , savory , mmmm -rrb- . <sssss> i had the parsnip soup ... so rich and creamy . <sssss> my entree was amy 's bolognese ... a garlic bread pudding with a bolognese sauce made w/beef & veal & tomatoes . <sssss> my hjusband had sand dabs and roasted brussel sprouts . <sssss> my son had a flat iron steak that melted in your mouth . <sssss> the presentation by the entire staff as they placed the dinners on our table was awesome . <sssss> but the best part was the peanut butter creme brulee with pretzels & banana ice cream . <sssss> binks is an adventure in the middle of phoenix . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back .
MID		i 've never seen so many beers in my life . <sssss> and try the tacos stuffed with mashed sweet potatoes , green chilis and cheese . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> the place was packed on a saturday afternoon and now i know why . <sssss> so many more things to try on our next visit and definitely a lot more beer to try ! <sssss> i loved my beer , its # 31 ... some pilsner thing . <sssss> perfect for me .
MID		this is such a divine little neighborhood place . <sssss> the peach white sangria really hits the spot on a warm day . <sssss> the outside area is perfect for friends and listening to music . <sssss> try the crab tapas -lrb- yum -rrb- and the brie soup -lrb- even yummier -rrb- .
HIG		i just ca n't way enough about the service , food , and general ambience . <sssss> besides being warmly greeted by the owner , we had a perfecf table to show our guests -lrb- who used to own their own restaurant -rrb- what we 've been raving about . <sssss> and they are raving as well . <sssss> today we had rusty , the laid back waiter , who was wonderful ! <sssss> and the food ... all is know is , you have to try the hapu -lrb- hawaiian fish -rrb- lemongrass encrusted with slaw and rice . <sssss> i practically licked the plate . <sssss> and guess what i found out ... the ice cream shop next door , twirl , is co-owned by dana so you can walk over and bring it back to your table . <sssss> thanks again for making this a great evening .
HIG		our waitress , kate , outdid herself once again . <sssss> she was so attentive and took care of our out of town guests . <sssss> the place was hopping but she still made us feel like we were the only table she was attending . <sssss> yummy food ... but now i understand why they call them spicy edamames . <sssss> wow !
MID		let me start out by saying that my only critique and the only reason i did n't give them five stars , is i made reservations on open table and because of a lot of people lingering in the restaurant , they put us in the bar . <sssss> but , i have to say that really turned out to be not a bad thing as our server was excellent , the food was excellent and the wine was smooth and wondeful . <sssss> i had their 16th st short rib stew -lrb- and kuddos that you have a small portion option -rrb- and it was scrumptious . <sssss> i practically licked the plate and you always know its a winner when i do n't offer to have anyone taste my dish . <sssss> it had been a long time since we were there and i doubt if it will be a long time before we go back .
MID		ok ... hot cheese , pretzels and shreiner sausage ... not a bad start to a scrumptious meal . <sssss> had a delicious fish sandwich with a chopped kale salad . <sssss> who knew that something that is natures scrub brush could taste so good . <sssss> the staff is nice , but not over the top . <sssss> i think they 're too busy to give that personal touch ... but they were attentive .
MID		yummy , yummy . <sssss> watermelon , goat cheese and heirloom tomato salad . <sssss> and a very helpful waiter that guided us through a culinary delight . <sssss> dave matthews dreaming tree chardonnay and mahi mahi tacos . <sssss> mmmmm .
LOW		will definitely have to go back for another try . <sssss> we hit it on a tuesday ... they were packed and not prepared for the crowd . <sssss> one waiter for both inside and outside . <sssss> the misters outside were pooling on my table . <sssss> the food was amazing . <sssss> we had the shaking beef and i tried everyone 's spring rolls and pho . <sssss> the lychee mojito yummy . <sssss> it was a good sign to be so busy ... but ... hope they learn by their mistakes . <sssss> i would love to go back and sit inside . <sssss> it was so cute in there . <sssss> have a feeling i could rate it 5 stars if i could sit inside . <sssss> ps : we had to park across 7th st. . <sssss> . <sssss> their private lot in the back was full and a cab blocked our way to get through it .
MID		girls night at smashburger . <sssss> who knew we would have such a great time , eat great food and have an awesome manager , chris , who made our experience even better . <sssss> once again , my vegie black bean burger with grilled onions and a fried egg on a multigrain bun was perfectly done . <sssss> the veggie frittes , too . <sssss> and a ice cold landshark beer in an ice cold frosty mug . <sssss> perfect night . <sssss> their staff kept checking with our rambunctious group , making sure we had what we needed and taking dirty plates away . <sssss> always a plus for me . <sssss> and thanks to the lady at the next booth who climbed on the table to take a picture for us . <sssss> we will be back again next month . <sssss> hope chris is ready for us !
LOW		grappled with the numbers of stars here . <sssss> 3 means a-ok ... well the food was but if i could rate the service separately it would barely get one . <sssss> dirty tables , messed up orders , inattentive staff . <sssss> and this time , there were only five of us . <sssss> on the plus side , my black burger tasted great ... once i got eat it . <sssss> they messed up on the bun and by the time they brought me the correct bun -lrb- no sauce -rrb- my friends were almost done eating . <sssss> the lady behind us had undercooked chicken . <sssss> come on ! <sssss> bring back chris , the awesome manager . <sssss> they were even out of my favorite beer : -lrb-
MID		another tini tuesday at fez although the price has gone up $ 1 since last year . <sssss> but definitely still worth the price . <sssss> our waiter , austin , was helpful and fun and his dimples did n't hurt either . <sssss> i had their go green pasta and added gyro strips to make it a delicatable greek feast . <sssss> i practically licked the bowl . <sssss> this time yelpers , we received a free appetizer of lettuce wraps by checking in with my yelp app . <sssss> loved it . <sssss> do n't know why we waited so long to go back ... will definitely be back sooner this time .
HIG		i do n't know where to start on the food experience here . <sssss> fried macaroni & cheese balls , shrimp and grits . <sssss> it was bliss ! <sssss> and what a kitchy place . <sssss> the artwork and rebar hangings were extraordinary . <sssss> our server , michelle -lrb- two l 's like me -rrb- was so patient and helpful . <sssss> she was one busy lady but kept checking back with our table . <sssss> i agree with rebecca r. . <sssss> . <sssss> please go there and help keep this place open 4ever ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back again .
HIG		might be my new favorite place to hang out on central , be a part of the `` scene '' and eat some really great food . <sssss> the staff was friendly and helpful . <sssss> my hawaiian margarita was awesome . <sssss> too bad i was the dd ... one was not enough . <sssss> everyone at the table had something unique and different and we all loved it . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back and try something else . <sssss> it was scrumptious !
MID		try the watermelon agua fresca , vodka and vanilla mint syrup . <sssss> what a cool refreshment on a hot phoenix day . <sssss> and its only $ 5.00 . <sssss> our waitress was attentive and helpful . <sssss> and the brown bag chicken sandwich was yummy . <sssss> really wanted to try a side of mac n cheese , but opted for the chopped kale salad . <sssss> what a nice surprise . <sssss> healthy and tasty .
MID		love the chips and salsa . <sssss> have been a fan of this place for eons . <sssss> but sure wish our server would have told us about the specials . <sssss> mahi tacos ... my favorite . <sssss> did n't see it until we were walking out the door .
HIG		this is the first time that i have given 5 stars to a restaurant . <sssss> but , they so deserve it . <sssss> our waitress , jill , was so wonderful and helpful . <sssss> her recommendations were spot on . <sssss> i loved everything about the place . <sssss> from the most amazing jalapeno cheddar grits to the banana split we shared for dessert . <sssss> the manager made many stops by our table to be sure everything was to our liking ... and it was . <sssss> i wish we lived in the neighborhood . <sssss> it would definitely become my neighborhood haunt .
MID		its been almost a year since i 've been to timo and do n't know why i waited so long . <sssss> it was another near perfect lunch with a delightful waiter - thanks robbie - and one of the best bloody mary 's i 've ever had . <sssss> it was garnished with asparagus , olives and shaved paremsan and it was perfectly seasoned . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> had the timo trio which includes your choice of soup -lrb- went with the butternut squash this time -rrb- , salad dressed with cranberries and bacon , and the sandwich of the day on a delicious roll . <sssss> it was a perfect day to sit out on the back patio . <sssss> do n't think i 'll wait so long for my next trip .
MID		we decided to give them one more chance . <sssss> and i am so glad we did . <sssss> first of all , i commend the owner , candy , for responding to my previous yelp and coming to talk to us tonight at dinner . <sssss> she is a warm , friendly , lovely lady and i am so glad to have met her . <sssss> our server , amy , was great ... even before she knew we had put something negative on yelp . <sssss> the last time must have been an off time . <sssss> like my first time , it was awesome . <sssss> the menu is so eclectic , with a phillipine flavor . <sssss> their homemade brews ... tasty and refreshing ... and each one compliments the food on the menu . <sssss> canadian , french , english , phillipine , chicago dogs , kobe burgers , vegeteratian pizzas , something for everyone . <sssss> and the vanilla malts ... made from the malt used in their beers . <sssss> omg . <sssss> this is definitely a family run , work of art , place that needs to be supported . <sssss> you have won me back !
MID		not much to add to my review from july . <sssss> i had the same dinner , the same drink . <sssss> love it ... love it . <sssss> keep the margs and warm tortilla chips coming !
LOW		i had rated this four stars last time . <sssss> although i enjoyed the dinner -lrb- pasta puglio is my favorite -rrb- the service was very inconsistent . <sssss> we went from sitting at the bar while we waited and having an outstanding bartender -lrb- thanks will -rrb- to a young waiter who said all the right things , went through the motions , but did n't listen to anything we said or asked for . <sssss> from bringing the main dish way before we even finished our salad to not splitting the bill , ryan was in need of some additional training . <sssss> again , the food is consistently good . <sssss> and i expect a wait on spaghetti & meatball night , but i also expect consistent service . <sssss> sorry . <sssss> maybe next time .
LOW		its a fun little place . <sssss> awesome french toast and since we were splitting our breakfast , they made sure they gave us everything on separate plates . <sssss> the staff was attentive and helpful . <sssss> food good ... just something about the place does n't knock my socks off . <sssss> i think i just like to come in , sit down and have someone bring me my menu and coffee .
HIG		lumpia , pork belly , everything filipino and did you know they will do private parties as well . <sssss> they will pull up in your driveway and give your party the best food , experience and fun . <sssss> follow them on facebook , go where the food trucks or go , or just have them over . <sssss> they are amazing , loving people , too . <sssss> still not sure i 'm ready to try the pig face ... maybe next time .
MID		yo adrian ! <sssss> you are the best waiter ! <sssss> you made us three lovely ladies feel welcome . <sssss> we loved your recommendations , too . <sssss> let 's talk creamy brie soup infused with truffle oil . <sssss> and the spicy copa with burrato cheese brushcetta was the perfect blend of cheese and spicy . <sssss> washing it down with sangria was so nice , too . <sssss> and after our leisurly lunch , we we just in time to go outside and start happy hour ! <sssss> $ 5 for any glass of wine . <sssss> perfect way to spend an afternoon chatting with the girls . <sssss> thanks , adrian ... good luck on your weight challenge !
HIG		i rarely give a restaurant five stars on my first visit , but i 'd go higher here if i could ! <sssss> what an experience ! <sssss> you definitely have to know where you are going . <sssss> the teeter house has so many memories for me and this is such a cute little house . <sssss> you feel like home . <sssss> all the servers and staff were so attentive and helpful in explaining these unique japanese out of the ordinary dishes . <sssss> and try things we did ! <sssss> from dishes off the cold plates served on tiny spoons -lrb- you have to try the grapefruit and hamachi - omg -rrb- with flavors that exploded in your mouth to perfectly cooked lamb chops and yellow tail . <sssss> our sous chef , chris , was a delightful addition to our table , explaining every detail of the execution and flavors and was an excellent saleman as well . <sssss> instead of a rich , creamy dessert , we opted for one more round of shabu shabu . <sssss> it was an experience in itself . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and to take others to be able to savor and smile as things explode on your taste buds . <sssss> thanks for a great evening !
MID		so those of you who know me , know i go for `` quirky '' . <sssss> quirky movies , quirky books , quirky hair ... and this place fits right into that mode . <sssss> it 's nestled on 12th st just south of thomas in the coronado neighborhood district and actually drove by it twice before stopping . <sssss> but i 'm so glad to have found it . <sssss> the cutest , ecclectic place , cute patio -lrb- but its 112 today so i looked through the window -rrb- and a great healthy ecclectic menu . <sssss> we went for lunch . <sssss> my friends each had a sandwich that was flavorful and different and i opted for the mexican gyro . <sssss> tender , melt in your mouth green chili pork on a pita -lrb- a tad hard to eat -rrb- . <sssss> they have a wonderful drink menu and found out that my favorite , hard to find beer -lrb- dixie new orleans beer -rrb- is sold from 5 -6 pm for $ 3 ! <sssss> scrumptious desserts , too . <sssss> i will definitely have to to go back and also try their sister dinner restaurant next door , the tuck shop . <sssss> again , this is n't your normal lunch , brunch place . <sssss> you have to go up and order and they bring it to your table -lrb- which i 'm not always a fan of -rrb- but i 'll give them the beneift here ... its worth it .
MID		was here for dinner monday and back again on sunday ! <sssss> i love the food and the choices . <sssss> our waiter was friendly and patient with this group of 5 women and i loved my pasta puglio . <sssss> monday i had roasted brussel sprouts and pancetta over pasta . <sssss> both were excellent and i definitely did n't need a doggie bag . <sssss> monday i had the white sangria , today the red . <sssss> both were yummy . <sssss> great specials and happy hours but do n't go online to read about them because this babbo does n't always have them same as the others . <sssss> and kudos to the warm herb bread and dipping oil .
MID		brought another friend to share in this family run place . <sssss> she loved it as much as i do . <sssss> a great array of brews ... i am partial to the lager . <sssss> she loved the fruity pomegranate brew . <sssss> we split a yummy , tangy kale salad , an order of pretzel bread , a bbq chicken flatbread and my favorite , lumpia , a phillipine type egg roll . <sssss> there was a band playing on stage ... a group of old guys who really did a great grateful dead set ... not too loud , just right . <sssss> its a nice , comfy , family run , neighborhood place ... you should try it .
MID		excited to go to another upward projects place as positinos and windsor are already a favorite . <sssss> great thin crust ... and lots of unique toppings . <sssss> all the servers seemed to help each other out and were attentive , tho , no personal touch . <sssss> busy , hopping , great location and food , tho . <sssss> i will go again .
LOW		i 've been waiting for a new moon valley hangout since basis closed . <sssss> this could possibly be the place . <sssss> a tad confusing if you 're used to market bistro being there but once inside , you realize this is no salad bar place . <sssss> we greeted by a friendly hostess and then approached by our attentive waitress . <sssss> a great beer & wine list . <sssss> our sandwiches were yummy . <sssss> ambience very nice , trendy but in a good way . <sssss> the price ... hmmmm . <sssss> that 's where it was definitely similar to basis ... it wasy pricey . <sssss> hope they have a good happy hour menu on their plate . <sssss> it could be a wonderful place for the community to go and have everybody know your name . <sssss> i will definitely try again .
MID		you got ta love tini tuesdays ! <sssss> $ 3 martinis that are the bomb ... especially the cherry bomb . <sssss> and if you subscribe to yelp , you can get special deals . <sssss> yesterday i had an awesome seared scallop appetizer for $ 8.95 that was n't on the menu ... only special customers enjoyed this savory treat . <sssss> the waiters are almost as delicious as the food . <sssss> our waiter , with a belt bucklet labeled `` cocky '' definitely was and treated all of us old ladies like we were queens -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> great times , great location , great food .
LOW		so my first impression was that this was a yuppie urban chipotle 's only more confusing since the menu was written over head instead of behind the servers which is ten times easier . <sssss> but , the beef short rib enchilada was so good and the choices of toppings -lrb- cheeses , vegies , etc -rrb- were so much better . <sssss> and they top it off by baking it in a cute little clay dish in the oven . <sssss> it was yummy ! <sssss> the chips , however ... much better at chipotles . <sssss> i will definitely go back for lunch soon and try some of the other interesting dishes ... probably not for dinner .
MID		thanks su vino for contributing to a wonderful afternoon with my goddaughter . <sssss> she is an unemployed bartender who recently relocated to phoenix . <sssss> she needed some instruction on wines to complete her resume . <sssss> we purchased a groupon for a wine flight and appetizers . <sssss> i was leery after reading some of the reviews . <sssss> all i can say is they bent over backwards to assist us , explain things , answer questions , and make this a totally enjoyable experience . <sssss> kudos to our server , jackie , who really made melanie feel special . <sssss> their recommendations were spot on . <sssss> and the glass of bubbly on the house did n't hurt , either .
HIG		thanks kate for being a fabulous waitress . <sssss> this was the perfect end to our day . <sssss> our group had one diner that has very special food needs and she was perfect in suggestions , moderations , guiding him along . <sssss> and this time , i was n't the dd -lrb- i asked for you dana -rrb- so the lucious passion fruit margs flowed . <sssss> and my dinner was the best ! <sssss> lemongrass encrusted hapu -lrb- hawaiian sea bass -rrb- was done to perfection . <sssss> only bummer ... it was raining and we could n't sit outside . <sssss> next time !
LOW		already lowered my raing ... hopefully a fluke on a bad day ... but brought two friends to the place i 'd been raving about and all they kept saying is `` i hope you put this on yelp '' . <sssss> we opted to sit outside altho it was a hot phoenix day and i think that may have thrown the staff out as it was like pulling teeth trying to get water , napkins , etc. . <sssss> it was happy hour when we got there , but a good server would of let us know when it was close to ending so we could replenish with another drink so when the bill came and we saw the difference in price of our beers , we were a tad put off . <sssss> one diner ordered a flatbread pizza , the other a burger . <sssss> we think our server decided to hold off serving the burger till the pizza was ready as the burger and fries were cold . <sssss> they did replace it but no attempt to adjust the bill or add a dessert or drink . <sssss> just an ` i 'm sorry '' which i suppose is better than nothing . <sssss> i am willing to give it one more try to see if we just hit it on an off day . <sssss> i hope so . <sssss> food is tasty and my friend who enjoys a good craft beer absolutely loved her choice . <sssss> she called it fruit salad beer . <sssss> we 'll see .
MID		always love an honest to god good diner ! <sssss> nothing fancy here . <sssss> but the food is yummy . <sssss> try the biscuits and gravy . <sssss> mmmmmmm . <sssss> and the service was friendly and competent . <sssss> we will be back for more !
HIG		three of us locals went to try a restaurant we had never been to before and came out wondering how come we did n't find this place before ! <sssss> the service was impeccable ... from the hostess to our waitress to the manager . <sssss> everyone was friendly and helpful . <sssss> we ordered the guacomole that is prepared tableside and we practically licked the bowl . <sssss> the posole and kobe dog hit the spot on a chilly afternoon . <sssss> the manager , michelle , stopped by our table and after some facebook discussion , sent us three small avocado margeritas to taste . <sssss> omg ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to spread the word about this place and i know my boys will love the kobe dog . <sssss> ca n't wait to go again soon !
MID		celebrating my husband 's birthday at a very wonderful , unusual , urban place . <sssss> i really wanted to give it a 41/2 but will wait for the next visit and pretty sure it would get 5 stars . <sssss> atmosphere & ambience is very cool ... outdoor ping pong tables , shuffleboard , fire pits outside or sit inside and you still get the same flavor . <sssss> great waiter , helpful , attentive . <sssss> but most of all , great menu . <sssss> we started with their antipasto board with an array of choices ... meats , cheeses , hardboiled eggs , roasted aspargus , beets . <sssss> what a great way to start . <sssss> the bistro steak on a bed of melted gorgonzola was mouth-watering . <sssss> and hot carmel monkey bread with apple filling and vanilla bean ice cream , on the house , to end the birthday celebration . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back .
MID		the greene house hit the spot last night - its hard to get hubby to try new places and honestly we 've been budget conscious about going out to eat lately , so we really want to make sure we 'll go someplace we 'll really enjoy . <sssss> luckily , hubby liked it , and we were happy with our experience . <sssss> i only give this place 4 stars because they are n't kid friendly -lrb- a little pricey and no kids ' options on the menu -rrb- , and the service was pretty slow , but even at that , the server was very friendly . <sssss> we sat out on the patio as the sun was going down - the place had a nice atmosphere and it was just nice to sit , people watch and enjoy the weather . <sssss> we started with the herbed hummus and i got the twin kobe burgers with fries - they were pretty decent , nothing out of the ordinary . <sssss> however , hubby got the mahi tacos and they were outstanding , as was the side of mac cheese we got for my son . <sssss> i do n't think i 'd order the same food , but i would definitely go again for a date night !
HIG		stumbled upon this place last night -lrb- during first friday -rrb- and could n't find a sign or the name until we saw a poster hanging inside . <sssss> cool house that was built in the 20 's , with the dj up top in the loft -lrb- music was great -rrb- , lots of great art on the walls and the bar has been built into where the kitchen of the house was . <sssss> they were totally packed and coud n't even get out to the back but it was really fun . <sssss> everyone was friendly and having fun . <sssss> the website says they offer 80 + beers , we had blue moons and some others i 'd never seen before -lrb- which is always cool ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> highly recommended , especially for first friday - the artists selling their works , jewelry , handmade goods , purses , sunglasses and more are lined up down the street near the lost leaf , and you can walk a short distance to galleries and the az center -lrb- great place to park if you do n't get downtown early -rrb- .
LOW		went for my sister 's birthday dinner last night . <sssss> i like the atmosphere there and the service was pretty good . <sssss> but i always think to myself that they are just a bit overpriced and the food just misses the mark of being great -lrb- i got the navajo sandwhich , it just kind of fell apart and was stuffed with really thick slices of underipe tomato that was white in the middle . <sssss> fries were cold -rrb- . <sssss> we ordered the kids ' pasta for my son and it was just that - a bowl of way too hot pasta -lrb- i just do n't know why restaurants serve kids ' meals at 1000 degrees -rrb- . <sssss> but that was it , just pasta , no veggies or sides . <sssss> it is a family place no matter what they try to be , it is a big loud place that people bring their kids to , is it too much to ask for a nice , healthy meal for my kid ? <sssss> but i digress . <sssss> again , loved the service but the food was underwhelming . <sssss> luckily i really enjoyed spending time with my family and that made it fun : -rrb-
HIG		the herb box provided us one of the best restaurant experiences we 've had in a very long time . <sssss> the herb box on pima in dc market ranch is really beautiful , warm and comfortable . <sssss> it has a smaller deli kind of section , a larger dining room and outdoor patio area . <sssss> we sat outside under the heaters and were treated to a great experience . <sssss> first , our waiter was really great . <sssss> he had a great personality , was very attentive , and had lots of great recommendations for us . <sssss> i started with a blackberry mojito - it had a very distinctive and strong flavor , but i liked it quite a bit . <sssss> i am not a big fan of mint but found that the blackberry mellowed the mint . <sssss> it went down easy ! <sssss> hubby got the steak and gorgonzola salad , and listened to him talk about how great it was with every bite ! <sssss> i also got to try the trout which was seasoned and cooked to perfection . <sssss> i ordered some appetizers for my dinner including the brown sugar and jerk pulled pork sliders , cheesed stuffed fried olives and the falafel plate . <sssss> i enjoyed all of it , seriously i ate until i could n't anymore . <sssss> the fried olive were frickin incredible , i 've never had anything like them . <sssss> the green olives were a bit tart and full of rich creamy cheese , and finished off with a light crunchy fried batter . <sssss> i am totally thrilled with this place , it is one of my new faves and will be added to the regular rotation .
HIG		the entire team at whole foods is amazing ! <sssss> i recenly took at tour at this location with some friends -lrb- phoenixfridaynight.com -rrb- , and julie , bianca , shawn and jesus made it a memorable event ! <sssss> i did n't realize it , but everything in the store is either organic or all natural . <sssss> you can have anything in the seafood department cooked to order , anything in the meat department butchered to order . <sssss> some other little things i did n't know about whole foods - you can make fresh pressed peanut butter near the bulk foods section , there are bins with different combos -lrb- peanuts and chocolate chips , honey roasted peanuts , etc -rrb- for different flavors . <sssss> there is also a wine and tapas bar at this location and you can also ask for samples of just about anything in the store . <sssss> i plan to visit the taqueria soon -lrb- next to the sandwhich and pizza stations -rrb- . <sssss> and , i mustve walked by a thousand times and never noticed , but they have a smoothie and coffee bar at the front of the store too . <sssss> i love whole foods - i know a lot of people who say they are more expensive so they avoid it , but i think their prices have gotten a lot better . <sssss> plus , you are supporting local growers and producers . <sssss> how cool is that ?! <sssss> thanks whole foods !
MID		this is so my go to place for shoes ! <sssss> went yesterday and got the hottest pair of red patent leather peep toe cole haan heels . <sssss> they were originally $ 275 marked down to $ 99 ! <sssss> found the perfect pair but they 're a bit tight ? <sssss> purchase your shoes and take them back to the shoe counter - they 'll stretch them for you for 24 hours at no charge . <sssss> the rest of the merch is pretty hit or miss . <sssss> i sometimes find great bargains on handbags and jewelry but the makeup and bath items tend not to be priced very well -lrb- pretty average , not really `` outlet pricing '' on those items -rrb- . <sssss> you never know what you will find for clothes , sometimes things seem picked through , but once in a while you can really find a designer bargain . <sssss> highly recommended !
MID		this used to be one of my favorite restaurants : -lrb- we noticed that right after it changed hands the service was n't as good as it used to be , but when we went recently it seems to have improved . <sssss> the food has always been superb - even if you are n't a steak eater , you are going to love their steaks -lrb- aged in-house -rrb- ! <sssss> i am also a fan of the spicey mambo salad with wasabe dressing -lrb- mastro 's salad is also really good , topped with a big shrimp , mmmm -rrb- , the chilean sea bass , and my all time favorite sinful splurge has to be the gnocchi side dish with cheese , lobster and truffle oil . <sssss> oh yes . <sssss> the mastro 's potatoes are also nice and cheesy and one of my favorite sides . <sssss> the butter and lava cakes are also a nice way to top off the evening . <sssss> do n't even think about getting a seat at the bar if you go on a weekend night at 7pm -lrb- and you will probably need to call in your reservations at least a week in advance during season -rrb- , but you can do some good people watching - twenty somethings that think they are all that , ladies of the night looking for sugar daddies and sugar daddies abound ! <sssss> my father in law even ran into jenna jameson there -lrb- yes , it was an akward conversation : -rrb- they have a really nice private dining room that looks in on the kitchen -lrb- really fun to watch them hoppin ' in there ! <sssss> -rrb- , but it has recently changed - be prepared to provide a credit card and commit to a minimum for the room these days . <sssss> this is a great place for a special night out , a big celebration , or a fun place to have a nightcap after a crazy night .
MID		after a failed attempt to get lunch at extreme pita -lrb- see previous review -rrb- we walked over to bww and were pleasantly surprised . <sssss> it was our first time there and from the outside we did n't expect to find a decently cool sports bar - not a bad seat in the house , there are literally wall to wall tvs , you ca n't miss the game . <sssss> the service was phenomenal from the hostess to the server to the runners . <sssss> i even dumped my coke like a clumsy pregnant woman and a cheerful girl came over to clean it up and had the server over with a new drink in no time . <sssss> we started with a half dozen medium wings and they were very good . <sssss> i had the buffalitos and onion rings . <sssss> the rings were pretty average , and i liked the buffalitos a lot except that the flour tortillas was a bit dry/stale . <sssss> my son got the popcorn shrimp and ate every last one of them , and hubby got a chicken wrap that he liked a lot . <sssss> we will definitely be back , mainly when i 'm not pregnant and may partake in games and beer : d
HIG		went for the first time yesterday for lunch . <sssss> it was soooo good ! <sssss> there is a wine / beer bar adjacent to the main retail / deli area . <sssss> lots of unique gifts , artisanal cheeses and more ! <sssss> i was amused that they take your lunch order on a brown bag and put your lunch in it . <sssss> had an excellent roast beef sandwich and sat out front -lrb- note for summer : they only have outdoor seating -rrb- . <sssss> clean , friendly and delicious , check it out !
LOW		disappointing in the sense that this had the potential to be a great experience . <sssss> cute place , nice staff , pretty patio . <sssss> oj tasted like fresh squeezed , carmel machiato was delish , food was fresh and good quality . <sssss> on the other hand , the table was wobbly and driving me crazy . <sssss> omelette came w the wrong side , no cheese and realized i never got my toast . <sssss> had to ask twice for coffee refill , and took 15 minutes to get the check which was a nightmare with kids . <sssss> could hear other tables with similar complaints , maybe an off day .
HIG		had a fabulous girls dinner here ! <sssss> i 'd never been , but one of the girls suggested it . <sssss> at first i was little leery , i have n't really had my best meals in hotel restaurants . <sssss> i was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> the place is really pretty , polished but unpretentious and comfortable with large tables and booths -lrb- the kind of place you can meet with a big group of friends and they are n't put off -rrb- , and the bar area was hoppin . <sssss> the service was very good , our waiter made great suggestions based on what we 'd like and was very attentive . <sssss> best of all was the food . <sssss> i had the caesar salad , which was decent , but the baked tomato soup was realllllllyyy good . <sssss> the flavors were delicious -lrb- sometimes tomato soup can be really acidic but my guess is that they even it out with a creamy base maybe ? <sssss> -rrb- and the potato souffle -lrb- sort of a whipped twice baked potato side -rrb- which was also really nice . <sssss> i will definitely be back , and i recommend it !
LOW		went with friends for lunch last week . <sssss> i 've never been - the atmosphere is fun , the place is huge and has an large outdoor seating area . <sssss> its like a macayos on steroids . <sssss> anyway , the food was good , and the service would good also . <sssss> except for when my friend wanted a simple substitution . <sssss> before we know it , 10 minutes have gone by , i 've had an entire conversation about something else with the 3rd person in our party and another staff person was brought over . <sssss> one of my friends called ordering lunch `` negotiating '' . <sssss> the poor guy gave up and ordered something else entirely . <sssss> it was good , it was just a weird experience .
HIG		i hardly ever get downtown for lunch and had no idea where to go , so i sent out a tweet . <sssss> a couple people independently suggested cibo , so we met friends there . <sssss> the place is very a charming , a converted house with brick wall , chandeliers , and cool art . <sssss> they serve sandwiches and salads at lunch time . <sssss> i got the pastrami and mostly enjoyed it . <sssss> it was actually a little too rich with the fontina for my liking , but overall pretty good . <sssss> the bread was toasty and incredible . <sssss> the staff was great - nice , genuine and friendly . <sssss> i love when servers know how to strike the balance of being attentive while giving you time to talk with your company . <sssss> last , but best , we ordered dessert crepes . <sssss> this is where the 5th star comes in - oh my freaking god . <sssss> we got a suzette which has orange marmalde folded in and is topped with gran marnier which they light at the table . <sssss> we also got one stuffed with warm nutella and topped with powedered sugar . <sssss> it was absolute freaking ecstasy on a plate . <sssss> let me tell you - if you ever have a hot date , or an apology to make , do it over wine and dessert crepes at cibo .
HIG		we had a fabulous time at roka akor on friday night ! <sssss> they saved the day by being able to take our large group with little notice . <sssss> we met some friends early for drinks at the bar . <sssss> the service was a bit slow , but it was pretty busy . <sssss> i had a glass of wine , one of my girlfriends got a lovely blood orange margarita and the bartender made up a beautiful fruity non-alcoholic drink for my prego girlfriend . <sssss> we were shown to our table right on time and had a fabulous server -lrb- wish i could remember her name -rrb- who took the time to explain both the yelp eats menu , the regular menu and about the restaurant . <sssss> we 'd ordered a bottle of wine at the bar that was n't part of the yelp eats wine special but she honored it anyway . <sssss> from there on out , all i can remember is servers filling my wine glass and bringing dish after dish of wonderful food ! <sssss> i had the tempura sweet potato and white fish , both were delicious - i am looking forward to going back just for them ! <sssss> next , i had the spicy avocado sushi and the hamachi serrano chilli roll , which were some of the best sushi i 've had in a while . <sssss> hubby 's pork chop was cooked to perfection , too . <sssss> i ca n't remember the last time we went out and both agreed that the atmoshphere , food , price and service were great . <sssss> best of all , he had a great birthday and we had a very memorable time with our friends . <sssss> we will definitely be back !
HIG		had the best best time here tonight ! <sssss> my mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and i insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me . <sssss> i 've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in . <sssss> the restaurant is beautiful - we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice . <sssss> the bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it -lrb- ala the ocean club bar -rrb- . <sssss> we has 2 rounds , including the vitamin c martini , white chocolate martini , flirtini and black cherry cocktail - they were all really great ! <sssss> we also got the colossal shrimp appetizer -lrb- which technically were n't all that colossal , they were just normal -rrb- , the sliders -lrb- the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing ! <sssss> -rrb- and the az eggrolls -lrb- a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour -rrb- . <sssss> the tab was only $ 65 -lrb- it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $ 6 / drink and app -rrb- . <sssss> the service was also extremely good . <sssss> it 's been a long time since i felt like raving about a restaurant - it was great !
HIG		this is one of my favorite restaurants for many reasons ! <sssss> the service is fantastic - roberto , the owner , and his wife susan are often at the restaurant , greeting guests and going table to table . <sssss> reservations are recommended -lrb- especially if you are going on a fri or sat night in season -rrb- , if you call ahead ask for wanda . <sssss> she is friendly and attentive , as is all the staff . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable - you will get a meal on par with mastro 's or flemings for half the price . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with their fresh pastas or seafood , homemade garlic sausages and wonderful desserts -lrb- love the semifredo ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> they have consistently served fantastic food for the years my hubby and i have been going . <sssss> the wine list is extensive , you 'll be sure to find a favorite that wo n't break the bank , and do n't forget to end your meal with an espresso or limencello . <sssss> the atmosphere is great - relaxing , intimate , a place where you can talk with and enjoy the people with you . <sssss> also , do n't miss the monthly wine dinners in summer - they serve new dishes that are n't on the menu and are very generous with the pours .
MID		invited here for a meeting last week and really enjoyed it . <sssss> on a side note , i am surprised at how often i am getting invited to the indian school and miller area these days , lots of great little places down there . <sssss> the atmosphere is very cute , a big bright pink wall , black leather furniture and ultra chic fashion photos on another wall -lrb- one of my guests knows the owner , apparently he was the photographer ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the pasties in case looked really lovely , and we had very attentive service . <sssss> our food was delicious - i had the the organic carrot veloute , a smooth and delicious soup accented with ginger and cilantro . <sssss> it was served with a bed of lettuce and dressing . <sssss> the only things that didnt thrill me were the salad -lrb- is it salad or garnish ? <sssss> if its a salad a couple slices of tomato and cucumber would be nice -rrb- and the price is a bit on the high side - $ 7 for the soup . <sssss> but the overall experience was great and we 'll be back .
HIG		i love this place ! <sssss> took my son yesterday morning . <sssss> it is always clean and well organized . <sssss> you can make a day of this park with so much to do ! <sssss> the park 's hours vary with the season but typically opens at 10am . <sssss> purchase your ride at the front office as you 're walking in . <sssss> the park has a fun train ride , carousel , a huge playground and large open fields with several ramadas for parties . <sssss> you can bring in your own food for a picnic or get lunch -lrb- things like chili , pizza , pb & j -rrb- just north of the train station or visit the snack bar near the carousel -lrb- ice cream , candy , popcorn , chips , coffee beverages -rrb- . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable , especially for ramada rental . <sssss> visit , you will love this place !
MID		went to lux for the first time yesterday to grab a hot tea and get some work done . <sssss> overall , it was a great experience and i am looking forward to returning . <sssss> the people who work there are pretty cool , they made me a couple great big mugs of hot tea and i had a crazy amazing brioche with huge chunks of sweet apples . <sssss> awwww yeahhhh ! <sssss> i would give it 5 stars but it is a bit on the pricey side , the atmosphere could be better and there are no seats at lunchtime . <sssss> i was standing around for a good 15 minutes like a jerk with my laptop waiting for someone to leave . <sssss> it seems like they might be able to make more room but its hard to say what the rest of the building is used for . <sssss> at any rate , the best thing about this place is n't the place , or even the coffee and food - its the people . <sssss> the employees are friendly and funny and the patrons are really , really cool . <sssss> i met 2 people there i knew from twitter who introduced me to another friend , who in turn introduced me to yet another person . <sssss> there is a great buzz in this place , lots of people thinking , working and talking all fueled by caffeine . <sssss> i had a ton of great conversation and thoroughly enjoyed myself . <sssss> looking forward to returning .
HIG		i 'd never been to sweet republic before , but we decided to host an event here -lrb- north valley friday night -rrb- on the last friday night of june . <sssss> the owners were very friendly and welcoming . <sssss> the place is really cute and their ice cream is amazing ! <sssss> i had the date ice cream paired with roquefort blue cheese ice cream . <sssss> it sounded crazy so i had to get it , and it was really really good ! <sssss> -lrb- for the less adventurous , s r offers normal flavors too , my son had mint chocolate chip -rrb- . <sssss> the home made brittle makes for a yummy topping and next time i plan to try one of their ice cream sandwiches - yummy ice cream in between two oversized cookies . <sssss> highly recommended !!
MID		stopped by here yesterday at happy hour ! <sssss> had a late lunch so a friend i shared the carrot souflee -lrb- it was good but not quite what we were picturing , guess we should 've asked ... -rrb- and a couple glass of wine -lrb- $ 4 at happy hour ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> regularly , all the wines are $ 6/glass or $ 20/bottle , even on wines that cost quite a bit more at other restaurants . <sssss> the service was a little on the slow side , but very friendly . <sssss> also really like the atmosphere , lime green white and black looks clean and modern but warm . <sssss> the outside seating area also looked really nice . <sssss> will definitely try it again for dinner soon .
LOW		had dinner here last night . <sssss> we used to go once a week and have dropped back a bit because of the service . <sssss> pj knows that the food is good and the price is right . <sssss> they pack the house even though the servers treat you more like a nuisance than a valued customer , which is why they do n't improve -lrb- and the only reason i knocked off 2 stars -rrb- . <sssss> i know they are all super-emo-cool but come on , there are lots of places to eat and the economy is bad ! <sssss> treat me like you 're happy to see me spending money in your restaurant ! <sssss> i have high hopes for the soon to open desert ridge location . <sssss> the chicken and hummus and lavosh shawarma were right on , as usual . <sssss> you might be aggravated with the staff but you wo n't be disappointed with the food . <sssss> carry out anyone ?
MID		i love this place ! <sssss> it is an really cool old school italian deli with the kinds of things my grandparents would have just loved - lots of imported groceries , gardineria , sweets and deli meats . <sssss> my absolute favorites are the italian roast beef -lrb- great sub rolls ! <sssss> -rrb- and you must get the fresh mozzarella appetizer - half moons of crispy fried mozzarella served with marinara .
LOW		heard of them before and got a postcard for a free `` floater '' -lrb- scalp massage -rrb- , and we have a salon client , so thought i 'd investigate . <sssss> overall a pleasant experience , online scheduling is easy and i got a text reminder which was nice . <sssss> it was a little hard to find them -lrb- they are n't in the s ` dale quarter directories yet -rrb- and their vm goes to a corporate number which has the loooooooongest automated message , but i found it ok after all . <sssss> i got there and gave them my postcard for the floater . <sssss> the place is very cute , i like the concept . <sssss> it was clean and bright , good music , mirrors everywhere are a bit much lol appropriately girly movie on the flatscreens , fresh flowers were happy looking , and the receptionist was cute . <sssss> they wound up forgetting my floater , which does n't seem like a big deal , but it was kind of the whole reason i went , so it sucked : -lrb- they gave me my postcard back to use again before it expires in may , which is nice , but it also means i have to get my hair done twice if i want to get a free scalp massage ... i still love my girls at my salon , but it was kind of nice to pop into a place 10 minutes from home and have them do a quick touch up and walk out feeling cute -lrb- i did get a lot of compliments -rrb- . <sssss> i 'll try it again . <sssss> i could see it being a fun place for a girls ' party : -rrb-
MID		had dinner here last night . <sssss> the atmosphere is way over the top , to the point that it kind of bugged me a little . <sssss> the walls are plastered with fake antique signs , small floral prints , painted messages and quotes - it kind of made me feel anxious . <sssss> there is also a weird gator head at the bar - it 's that kind of place . <sssss> other than that though the food was amazing . <sssss> we started with fried okra and it was awesome - nice big pieces deep fried and served with a delicious spicy mustard sauce . <sssss> hubby enjoyed the novelty of iced tea served in mason jars . <sssss> we both had bbq tri tip sandwiches which were very good and not at all greesy , and i loved the spicy bbq sauce . <sssss> i was a bit disappointed with the braised greens - they were extremely salty and devoid of flavor . <sssss> also , the server was ok enough , he just lacked any kind of enthusiasm . <sssss> all in all it was a pretty good experience and we would try it again .
HIG		had a great lunch here with my friends sherry and brandon . <sssss> the two owners -lrb- i am guessing here , but father and son ? <sssss> -rrb- were very friendly and attentive . <sssss> i had the baba ganouj pita with lettuce and tomato , and everyone else 's food looked great -lrb- a chicken pita sandwhich and amazing looking lentil soup -rrb- . <sssss> i was throroughly entertained by a middle eastern television show -lrb- satellite i guess ? <sssss> -rrb- , and the great mix of locals and business people . <sssss> the market section is also great - you 'll find loads of bottled cooking oils , spices , pickles and other pickled veggies , canned eggplant , cous cous and pastas , as well a fridge section with nice looking prepared foods . <sssss> will definitely return !
MID		i give the desert botanical gardens 4 out of 5 stars , only because they just are n't the same as they used to be : -lrb- my hubby and i were married there almost 6 years ago , so we 've always had a special attachment to the gardens , and have been members ever since . <sssss> the paths are lovely - really a nice way to spend the day getting fresh air and sunshine , soaking up the amazingly lush succulents and cacti , bunnies , birds , and other animals . <sssss> the butterfly pavilion is also a treat when its in season , and a lot of the festivals and classes are great , as are the changing art exhibits -lrb- ca n't wait to see the chihuly exhibit !! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the only thing that disappoints me is how freakin expensive it has gotten ! <sssss> i am totally not cheap , and i am all about supporting the non-profits , but the cost of events and memberships has gone up and up an up every year . <sssss> i start to wonder how the average family could enjoy the gardens ? <sssss> we love the agave on the rocks and luminarias events , but we may or may not go this year because the prices have just gotten outrageous , even at member-pricing . <sssss> it seems like most of the mailers we get these days are highlighting their fundraising activities and we recently got hammered with calls during a fundraising campaign . <sssss> i totally get it , its just a turn off to hear so much about the fundraising . <sssss> it just seems like they have become more preoccupied with raising funds than adding value for visitors lately . <sssss> i still love it here , a beautiful place that holds special meaning to us . <sssss> its great to bring family , out of town visitors or for dates .
MID		this is my favorite burger joint as delux has the best burgers for taste . <sssss> i 've never had a problem with the food here , only thing i find strange at times is sometimes the wait staff has a bit of an attitude , which is funny considering it 's a burger place . <sssss> i know it 's in the biltmore-arcadia area but la de da . <sssss> this last visit was funny as i saw some parents bring a bunch of children here . <sssss> this does not seem like the type of place to bring your child , totally odd , but whatever rocks your boat .
LOW		love the food , service is mixed . <sssss> we were promptly greeted , it seemed busy for a sunday night . <sssss> once we got our drinks however and stated we needed a few minutes , one was two , two was three , three was fifteen minutes later so that was a little annoying . <sssss> i wanted something new so i ordered the athenian sphagetti and i added gyo meat with it and had their salad . <sssss> we also ordered the hummus trio . <sssss> the food was awesome . <sssss> my spaghetti was great and i 'm not much of a pasta person but my choice with the add on was perfect . <sssss> i think if the place had n't been so unexpectedly busy on a sunday the service would have been a bit quicker . <sssss> i wo n't hold it agaisnt them as it is hard to find a greek food place open on sunday . <sssss> i 'll be back .
HIG		this place has a nice twist on italian . <sssss> the atmosphere is great its wide open . <sssss> you can see everything in the kitchen from meats being cut to things being cooked , there should be an food network focus show done here ! <sssss> the lighting is wonderful , i even picked up some interior design ideas . <sssss> the food was extremely tasty , a little on the salty side , but it probably was the pruiscuitto . <sssss> the wait staff is extremely friendly and there is complementary valet . <sssss> north , i 've made a new friend , i 'm excited to get to know you and your menu in the future and develop a tasty culinary relationship . <sssss> fyi-this is a great date place . <sssss> it will delight your date as its not trite .
HIG		best banana walnut pancakes in the valley . <sssss> they even serve the syrup on the side nice and warm to melt the fresh butter . <sssss> tuna salad sandwich is also on my top five sandwiches . <sssss> friendly staff , free wifi and plug ins for your laptop . <sssss> could it be any better ?
LOW		i might give it one more try . <sssss> the service was fast , the sandwich was relatively good but could have been more flavorable considering the price point of this restaurant . <sssss> then came the food with a bag of plain lays potato chips . <sssss> i think subway offer more flavor for less money . <sssss> on the upside the coleslaw had an interesting twist with the feta cheese . <sssss> they could have cut it up better , looked like a shake out of the bag job . <sssss> do n't go out of your way to eat here .
MID		thanks to the wondeful folks at groupon tried caffe boa . <sssss> i had to say i am eager to return . <sssss> the decor and atmospher is very cosmo and open , there are plenty of intimate tables and those for larger groups . <sssss> our waiter was very friendly and we received our drinks within a short period of time . <sssss> we were also seated fairly quickly . <sssss> the appetizer caesar salad was ok , the bread with sauce was much better . <sssss> i liked the basket approach . <sssss> i ordered their version of the fried chicken which had a bean salad type side dish . <sssss> very very good . <sssss> i look forward to trying the brunch , i wish they had a location in central phoenix . <sssss> the music was also very urban . <sssss> i thought this was a great date dinner setting . <sssss> thanks caffe boa
LOW		frequent slow/inaccurate orders . <sssss> this is not one of the better valley locations . <sssss> metro center is the one to beat . <sssss> on my two of my three visits here , its taken nearly 20 minutes to get my order . <sssss> one of those two visits they did it incorrectly , and i had to switch the order to go as they burned up my lunch hour with their mistake . <sssss> another to go order the dressing with my salad was watered down and it was caesar . <sssss> it ran like it was vinagerette . <sssss> i 've mentioned the services issues to their manager . <sssss> first time they only apologized , never gave me reason to come back . <sssss> after three tries with this location , i 'll stick with metro center .
MID		my friend and i ended up here by accident but i 'm glad we stopped by ! <sssss> service is very attentive here , and we were quickly seated . <sssss> we ordered the cheese crab puffs and the potstickers . <sssss> i 'd pass on the cheese puffs , they had a bizarre flavor , that i still ca n't put my finger on . <sssss> the pot stickers were perfect . <sssss> i ordered the pepper beef and it was very good . <sssss> the red and green peppers were cooked just perfectly so they were not too soft or crisp and the beef was also done just right with the perfect amount of pepper sauce . <sssss> it came with white rice , which i 'm not use to , since i usually have brown , but that was fine also . <sssss> decor is fine , a little 60 's china-ish but it seems to suit the place . <sssss> from the diverse crowd that was there last night enjoying themselves , it seems they agree with me . <sssss> this place is a hit .
MID		this is one of my favorite lunch places-rivals pita jungle , especially when i want to mix up my mediterranean with french fries . <sssss> prices are great for lunch , and you can opa size for a couple bucks more to include a salad or fries and a drink . <sssss> you ca n't beat it . <sssss> to go service is fast and food is always tasty . <sssss> love the big gyro salad . <sssss> staff is very friendly .
MID		food is great , love it love it love it . <sssss> the philla steak pita , the hummus , the mediterranean chicken salad , got ta love it . <sssss> wait staff on the male side is total eye candy , however , ca n't say i 'm impressed by being called dude . <sssss> my waiter need some listening skills as he forgot my soda until i reminded him for the 2nd time . <sssss> maybe cuz it was cuz he was giving elevator eyes to customers and staff . <sssss> would give this place more but think the male wait staff needs to come down to earth a bit so we can at least have a decent conversation ... dude .
HIG		this was my second visit and i got to take two of my newbies to the place . <sssss> we were seated promptly indoors , and the staff was very friendly . <sssss> i ordered a blood orange mojito and it was excellent and quite large-just the way a cocktail should be . <sssss> i ordered the chicken which was excellent and the two sides i had were the stuffing and beans . <sssss> it was sooo good . <sssss> we felt no pressure in turning over the table as they do in some restaurants . <sssss> i tried my friends mashed potatoes and they were so good . <sssss> he cleaned his plate and raved about it and he eats like a bird so i know he like it . <sssss> ca n't wait to try a new selection and for the next groupon .
MID		great food and friendly service , atmosphere lacks an italian feel . <sssss> i went here on sunday evening . <sssss> its not a large restaurant , its clean and well lit . <sssss> first though walking in was though it was modern and minimalist . <sssss> did n't speak italian to me , so i figured would wait for the food . <sssss> our first round of drinks was a little watered down , but did n't mention anything as my blue mojito seemed removed from the world of italy . <sssss> when they brought the food , though it spoke wonderful italian . <sssss> we had the aspargus with parmesan and mushrooms to start . <sssss> i am no fan of mushrooms , but these were great . <sssss> buttery , not too chewy , and just right . <sssss> my ex and i ordered the spaghetti and meatballs . <sssss> portions were just right and the sauce was perfect , not too thick and perfect in its tomatoess . <sssss> food was brought out fairly quickly . <sssss> i look forward to coming again , my only impression leaving was with the interior , it felt kind of like the pei wei of italian , just lacking the red trademark pei wei lighting . <sssss> maybe they can substitute yello or blue and make it trade mark babbo .
MID		i like the original here next to la grande orange , but the one on central is closer , nevertheless on this visit , there were plenty of open seating , and it was nice and cool . <sssss> i ordered a mocha , as i felt it was one of those mocha sundays after a beer saturday . <sssss> the mocha was the best i have ever had . <sssss> i also ordered for our table the mozzarella and tomatoes which was really tasty and was the perfect size appetizer . <sssss> i ordered my fave , the autostrada , which was perfect , and the bread was crispy but not over done . <sssss> we had a bit of mishap with when it came to the check , as someone had made a mistake , however another member quickly resolved the issue without question . <sssss> that is why i return again and again to this place , also the vocal entertainment that was there also provided a great sunday lunch experience .
MID		i always have a great time at fez . <sssss> sunday night was 50 % off of all bottles of wine and we had an excellent bottle of hob nob pinot noir . <sssss> service was friendly , atomosphere is always an interesting mix and my order the lamb kisra was good as always . <sssss> the food was out to our table really fast . <sssss> you ca n't miss with fez , i think it 's time for the pomegranite chicken again next time .
HIG		nordstrom razzle dazzle boom , your customer service sends me sailing away on a mediterranean dream seas . <sssss> i purchased an armani watch over a year ago . <sssss> i kept the receipt , i know , smart right ? <sssss> well to my dismay the movement died on it . <sssss> fast fix wanted to charge $ 65 and so i thought i would give it a shot to return it for store credit . <sssss> the mens watch service associate without hesitation offered to send it for warranty repair service since they did n't carry the model anymore . <sssss> i was tickled beyond belief . <sssss> she explained the wait time , and best of all no charge . <sssss> thanks nordstrom , you did it again .
HIG		updated and still great ... i took a break from putting up christmas decor . <sssss> i was in the mood for a torta so i decided to pop by . <sssss> since my last visit , the patio has been expanded with some sun shades . <sssss> art and the interior also have some bright updating done . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and helpful . <sssss> the guacamole is great and still a highlight for me . <sssss> i ordered the carne asada torta . <sssss> the food was out promptly and the music provides a great eclectic and urban feel . <sssss> happy hour deals are great and include some food items .
HIG		eat , drink , repeat . <sssss> this was a wonderful dinner . <sssss> we started with the tortilla espanola and my friend who went to spain recently said it was better than what he had in spain . <sssss> i ordered the salpicon de congrejo and it was very light and refreshing . <sssss> the waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and down to earth . <sssss> we then ordered the pollo colonial and lomo con romesco . <sssss> the flavor was beyond belief , it was so pleasing to the palate . <sssss> my chicken had this wonderful crispiness that was yet still delicate and flavorful . <sssss> my glass of malbec was really good . <sssss> the owner also came to our table and asked how everything was and apologized for it the restaurant temperature being too cold , but we did not find it cold , so it was great to meet the owner . <sssss> to top it off i had a an almond desert that was unique . <sssss> the music and atmosphere was perfect , i ca n't wait to come here again , i know some folks have mentioned the portion sizes , but i found the key is to order a number of dishes together and share . <sssss> lastly , thanks groupon for the introduction , this place really stands out .
MID		ok , i 'll admit it , i get my once a week culver 's fix . <sssss> usually the delux double w/fries ... can you say good times . <sssss> i 've done the chicken sandwich once and was not impressed so i 'd stick with a burger which is very addictive . <sssss> ever since culver 's opened , i have not set foot in a wendys for their double . <sssss> reminds me of grilled goodness from the midwest . <sssss> friendly staff too .
LOW		upside lots of theatres , downside , the staff are as dumb as a box of rocks . <sssss> went to the new sherlock holmes film yesterday afternoon . <sssss> 20 people in line , one staffer , one staffer . <sssss> normally i would use the automated box to buy my ticket , but i had a gold pass . <sssss> do n't feel like gold using it though ! <sssss> this theatre is closest to me , but it drives me nuts when they ask if i want to join their pay for rewards program . <sssss> why would i want to pay for rewards to be your customer-shish . <sssss> by the way if you eat at a restaurant and have parked in the garage , validate at the theatre . <sssss> they validate longer . <sssss> i made the mistake of using validation once from my big fat greek and saved a whole dollar . <sssss> i repeat one whole dollar .
LOW		while i found the majority of things that i needed i had a run in with one of the female employees here . <sssss> i wish i remembered her name but her name tag should say attitude . <sssss> i was ready to check out and found an item that i think costco had a coupon for and i remembered that i did n't think i needed it since they automatically rang up . <sssss> i asked the associate if the register would ring it up automatically and she asked me in a snotty way , `` do you need to bring your coupons to other stores to get the discount off ? <sssss> i said yes and then she said well you have your answer . <sssss> i should have asked for a manager-she needs to be coached-badly . <sssss> i do n't usually go to this one anyways , the one off of i-17 and the 101 has much friendlier staff . <sssss> otherwise , this was an ok visit .
LOW		i think dillons had a grand opening or something . <sssss> i went yesterday early evening and it was unorganized amongst the staff . <sssss> the entryway was clogged with people and it was a cluster ... well ya know . <sssss> the building itself is in bad need of an interior makeover as the tables and booths look like they are at least 20 years old . <sssss> the appetizer was some beef bruschetta thing where the meat was cold on it . <sssss> i was not impressed . <sssss> however the entry was a chicken fried chicken and it was the down home comfort food i was craving and it was hot . <sssss> i felt sorry for the staff yesterday it looked like they were trying but were in need of a good manager . <sssss> maybe i 'll try the bbq sometime but will wait a bit to see if they get the kinks out of their service .
MID		best flavorful food out of all mexican fast casual restaurant chains . <sssss> my favorite two items are the tacos and the salad . <sssss> the tacos with grilled chicken rock ! <sssss> i added some of their ranch dressing and special crumble cheese to mine and they were wonderful . <sssss> the taco salads are great also . <sssss> lots of flavor . <sssss> unlike other previous reviewers i do not need a concierge to work my way through a fast casual restaurant . <sssss> read the website , take more than 2 minutes to read signage and ask questions if needed . <sssss> staff is friendly sometimes a little slow in the head but i do n't consider this full service . <sssss> they have daily specials unlike chipotle or qdoba and outdoor seating options . <sssss> check out the drink options , amazing refreshing choices like sugar free strawberry lemonade . <sssss> delicious
HIG		ice cream and yogurt -- step aside and exit please . <sssss> this place is tops in my book . <sssss> their are tons of flavors to choose from , you can also take in some samples and they have a flavor of the month . <sssss> seating indoors is a little limited but when the weather is decent plenty of spots outside to people watch and check out eye candy . <sssss> this is perfect way to skip the dessert at whatever restaurant you are at , and get one much more flavorful and worth the price . <sssss> my favorite flavors to date are the roche and the vanilla bean , perfect contrast . <sssss> staff is friendly and the music is kind of loungy . <sssss> i 've also gelato from other spots and it is no match , this is the most creamiest , flavorful gelato i 've had to date .
MID		i love this place , it evolves in simple elegant ways . <sssss> it 's been a little more than a year since i 've last been there . <sssss> i booked the reservation on line and was able to get a reservation 45 minutes earlier than quoted by phone . <sssss> on-line is where its at . <sssss> new addition since i 've been there a cosmo dj spinning some old school tunes . <sssss> love it , love it . <sssss> took the parents , they are a little afraid of change but they give this a passing grade the last time we were here . <sssss> the sangria is very tasty and got two pitchers . <sssss> order the lamb meatballs ; pass on them , they need more flavor . <sssss> the stuffed dates are a sure hit though . <sssss> entrees were pork tenderloin and chicken . <sssss> these were all perfect and flavorful . <sssss> wait staff is perfect . <sssss> i finished off with the hazelnut pudding . <sssss> the pudding was great , the pastry that was on the side , had mystery flavors that i would pass on . <sssss> i wish there was a location arond the biltmore area . <sssss> fox restaurants this place is a hit !
LOW		i had a gift card from christmas that was burning a hole in my wallet , so i went here for a work lunch . <sssss> food was excellent , i got the four cheese pastachettis with chicken . <sssss> it took longer than expected to receive the entree but the flavor was wonderful . <sssss> cheese , cheese and more cheese just the way this midwestern boy likes it please . <sssss> service was attentive and friendly . <sssss> my only concern now is that with my digestive system is sounding like an earthquake . <sssss> i hope that it agrees with me later on this afternoon and does n't send me into a multiple dating spree with the bathroom . <sssss> yikes .
MID		we had one of the bottles of malbec , the staff was friendly , the atmosphere was open , the music was very hip lounge . <sssss> parking is a bit sparse , but i was lucky enough to nab an off street spot . <sssss> i will stop by next time for something from the menu . <sssss> the malbec was wonderful .
LOW		i had placed an order for a television last weekend over dot.com with the option to pick up . <sssss> i placed it using my debit card and jumped through the hoops of getting the authorization approved due to the amount . <sssss> i placed the order on a sunday evening at 11pm and then went into the store on monday at 12 pm the next day . <sssss> i 've always in the past been able to pick up items rather quickly with the dot.com w/pick up in store option . <sssss> mind you , i was moving so i did not get a chance to check for the pick up email , but figured after a half day , the order for the television would be ready , but not so . <sssss> i went to customer service and they stated the order was stuck in the dot.com fraud que . <sssss> i stated it was ridiculous as they had the money from the authorization and could see my id and the card i was using . <sssss> the customer service associate called the dot.com department was was told they did n't know how long it would be for the order to come through but it could be up to two days . <sssss> i asked if i would have done it in person at the store if i would have gone through the same thing and was told i probably would have walked out with the tv at the point of sale . <sssss> question best buy what is the point of ordering through your website with the store pick up if i can get it faster just by going to the store ? <sssss> so much for convenience . <sssss> i told the sales representative to tell dot.com that that was bad service . <sssss> apparently she did follow up and tell dot.com about my displeasure and they offered me $ 15 in reward zone certificates to placate me . <sssss> i would have given this two stars , but i gave it three as at least the in store associate tried to correct the issue . <sssss> for those of you that order through the website beware ! <sssss> if you use your debit card you may not be passing go to get your item until 1-2 days later .
MID		once i decided to switch this from a possible weekend burger choice to a work lunch choice , this fit it perfectly for me . <sssss> i like how they let me choose the bun that i want for my classic smash and if i ask for a side of mayo or anything it 's brought out without hesitation . <sssss> the wait is quick , the place is clean , the menu is not that complicated . <sssss> most importantly the burger has really great flavor for the money spent . <sssss> perfect for lunch when the last thing i want to do is think , at least too much . <sssss> smashburger you are a smash . <sssss> now how trite is that . <sssss> lol .
LOW		a comedy of errors is the best description for our experience last night . <sssss> our appetizer the mozzarella was over cooked and was more like potato chips , the bread was in short supply and took forever . <sssss> our entrees took over an hour to arrive on our table . <sssss> to top it off , the waitress , did n't listen on how we wanted to split our bill and one of our party had to walk to her to coach her on how we wanted the check split . <sssss> nothing hard either , split the bill , apply my $ 20 giftcard to my portion and bill me the balance . <sssss> while i do n't blame the waitress for the slow service due to short staffing , i 'm glad i do n't come often . <sssss> now i understand why . <sssss> for the money , there are plenty of other italian choices . <sssss> enough said .
MID		i always enjoy my visits to pf changs . <sssss> the quality of the food is consistently good and flavorful , and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is very tasteful . <sssss> every time i come in you can see guests laughing and smiling so you know the enjoyability of the restaurant is contagious . <sssss> the staff is always very pleasant and accomodating and informative if you have any questions . <sssss> a bonus is that they issue out a 10 % off discount card that i received after a visit in downtown san jose , ca . <sssss> how can it get any better ?
MID		nordstroms is the capital of retail service . <sssss> i first visited on veteran 's day as i was looking for a stephen webster ring i found on the neimas marcus website and figured i would try nordstrom and see if they had any comparable man jewelry . <sssss> i ended up strolling past the emporio armani watches and found a lonely one that was screaming for me to take another look . <sssss> btw-it was packed this particular in this department . <sssss> i really liked the watch but extended the minimum 24 hour wait to see if you really want it rule . <sssss> the sales associate kindly gave me the style , and price information for reference . <sssss> after 48 hours i decided i really wanted it and stephen webster would have to wait . <sssss> i went in and first thing , the sales associate in the department complimented my shoes . <sssss> ok , hook was definitely sunk in . <sssss> she said that was the first thing she noticed , and then complimented the watch and it 's unique styling . <sssss> i really felt the spotlight was on me the customer as it was n't the usually schmooping you get at the target check out . <sssss> she boxed it up , asked me where i got my shoes and i was on my way , watch in tow . <sssss> normally , i look for friends and family sales for armani watches at macy 's but they did not have this style . <sssss> thanks nordstrom , for helping me with my touch of distinct and unique style .
MID		it has been quite a while since i 've been to harley 's italian bistro . <sssss> tonight we went and had one of the bread appetizers . <sssss> it was quite good and then my friend ordered the ravioli and i tried a chicken entree with pesto . <sssss> mine was quite wonderful , but the rule i find at harley 's is that not to finish your meal , have about half and take the other with you as the cuisine ends up being a bit rich on the digestive system . <sssss> our waiter was polite , in fact almost old world , old school polite , it was so sweet . <sssss> thanks pablo . <sssss> the food was great , came out relatively fast , service was attentive and it 's a relaxing environment . <sssss> when i 'm craving italian , i 'll be sure to drop by more often .
MID		this was a night of new taste experiences for me . <sssss> we arrived and the atmosphere was very light , ambient , and loungy . <sssss> no surprises since this is at the w hotel . <sssss> the restaurant staff was very friendly , and we were greeted fairly quickly . <sssss> we ordered the edamame which was a first for me , -lrb- i 'm behind the times on this one -rrb- a nice different taste . <sssss> i ordered a blackberry smash which was nothing short of wonderful . <sssss> i definitely could have ordered a double . <sssss> another person in our party had a cold sake that i found was soo good , i had to try it twice . <sssss> our waiter was very friendly , down to earth and low key . <sssss> amongst us we ordered some sushi , i ordered the ji-dori chicken and the other person in our group ordered the braised pork . <sssss> apparently they were out of pork so that was not available which was a disappointment . <sssss> food was out at a decent time and the sauce with the mushrooms and potatoes had a wonderful zing and afterbite . <sssss> our sushi eater had his eyes rolling back the entire time with his head agaisnt the booth so i can only assume the experience was nothing short of orgasmic . <sssss> we only had a small snafu with a groupon discount , but that was corrected without issue . <sssss> i 'll be sure again to come to try the pork and have multiple blackberry smashes . <sssss> even though i have not been won over to try sushi , i 'm more than willing to have this restaurant experience again .
MID		i love this place-probably the best greek food in town and its evidenced by how busy it always is . <sssss> the family knows their customers , they have my favorite items memorized and if i get an order to go for lunch at work , they are fast and very friendly . <sssss> very very tasty , and even better that its not a commericialized place , their advertising is stricly word of mouth . <sssss> this is a small business restaurant run very well .
LOW		come for the sides and appetizers . <sssss> i utilized a $ 30 groupon and tried the aspargus with goat cheese and special dressing . <sssss> the aspargus was perfectly cooked and the goat cheese was fresh and soft . <sssss> i ordered one of the more mexican/southwest style burgers and macaroni and cheese . <sssss> the macaroni and cheese was delicious and totally addicting . <sssss> the burger was ok , and seemed a bit dry even cooked at medium . <sssss> staff is very friendly , but music/background noise from televisions , etc seemed loud . <sssss> not my favorite place for burgers , but id definitely come back for the sides and appetizers .
LOW		target your pharmacy staff needs some serious help . <sssss> my healthcare provider wrote a script for a medication that was an injectable , some needles , and a syringe . <sssss> nevertheless , when i picked up the medication the syringe was on order and you could not find my order for needles . <sssss> then when i go to get my injection , i find out that the pharmacy staff was arguing with my doctors office on the size of needles needed . <sssss> who is my health care provider ? <sssss> ugh , i should have taken this particular script to cvs or someplace that does not have a 4 tech to 1 actual pharmacist ratio . <sssss> all for that $ 10 giftcard coupon . <sssss> now i 'm not sure if that free bottle of cheer was worth it for all this hassle . <sssss> i guess maybe if my clothes stay colorful and bright i can laugh about this . <sssss> remind me next time target i will only bring you prescriptions with monosyllabic words . <sssss> shish .
MID		although , i missed the taco happy hour i was able to get one of the tortas sandwiches and the chips and guacamole . <sssss> the sandwich was very good and the guacamole had a wow factor as it is not the run of the mill stuff . <sssss> the patio has been recently done/updated and being it was a nice evening outside we got to enjoy eating out . <sssss> i did not get to take in the flamenco dancing before but have done so before and found it full of fun and totally enjoyable to watch . <sssss> this place has come so far . <sssss> reminds me a bit of hotel babylon , but without the pretension
HIG		this is my favorite asian cuisine/martini happenin place in central phoenix . <sssss> staff is very helpful , relaxed and friendly . <sssss> our waitress had great knowledge of the martini and food menus . <sssss> service was fast , atmosphere is very loungy/relaxed and there are specials twice a week . <sssss> food has wonderful flavor and portions are perfect . <sssss> price is extra nice . <sssss> there is also a late night martini happy hour for like $ 5 a piece and great dj dance music . <sssss> location is perfect . <sssss> ca n't wait to go again .
MID		this was my first visit here and it felt like a neighborhood italian pizzeria . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and well the best part the pizza was wonderful . <sssss> the crust was thin and the meats on the pizza were very flavorful . <sssss> i think we had ordered the meat lovers , and it had the perfect amount of sauce . <sssss> the order came out very quickly and the waiter was very attentive and even threw in a bit of cheesy humor for measure . <sssss> parking might need some help , as it looks sparse , but i think its building specific . <sssss> i would love to come here again .
LOW		nothing to see here folks -- the food was not bad , the ingredients were fine but no flavor that leaves you with a za za zoom . <sssss> i ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda . <sssss> $ 2.50 for a soda ? <sssss> the total for this lunch was $ 15 . <sssss> now i remember why i do n't come here for lunch , for the money , there are a lot better choices . <sssss> the upbeat music does not account for the $ 4 difference between this place and many others . <sssss> service was friendly , but i do n't think i 'll be back . <sssss> . <sssss> anytime soon or until i forget why i stopped in the first place .
MID		i was here for wednesday lunch using my handy groupon that i purchased recently . <sssss> the waiter was pleasant , and recognized i was busy checking voicemails and emails and did n't engage me in needless chit chat . <sssss> i ordered a couple of beers and the new york strip with a ceasar side salad . <sssss> the steak was cooked perfectly to my liking and had a tasty sauce on top of it . <sssss> the carrots were cooked just right not too mushy or crunchy . <sssss> i wish ticoz would restore some of the pricier items back to the menu as this like others are their crown jewel .
LOW		food is great , but watch out during busy times ; seating is scarce and people circle tables like vultures waiting to sit down . <sssss> favorites are turkey pastrami , butterscotch cookies and roast beef . <sssss> staff is great !
MID		we finally made it down here after hearing good things from the locals . <sssss> we only stayed about an hour but i would defiitely love to go back . <sssss> my friend and i had the $ 2 margarita special on fridays and when the server brought it out , i was like , maybe we did n't get the special -lrb- since the glass was so tall -rrb- . <sssss> but to my surprise , it was the special ! <sssss> a girl can get into alot of trouble with those yummy tall glasses of $ 2 goodness . <sssss> since we were headed to a reverse happy hour , we split their $ 10 bruschetta plate . <sssss> note , my husband orders it correctly to sound like : `` brusketta '' and the server corrects him , `` oh , the brushetta '' ? <sssss> funny but annoying , too . <sssss> the bruschetta was extremely good with three pieces each of two kinds . <sssss> when i go back , i am dying to try their white cheddar grits . <sssss> their menu looked pretty good and we loved the decor . <sssss> there was lots of different types of seating and the patio looked super cute . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and get tanked on $ 2 margaritas ... classy , i know .
MID		my husband tried this place out using an entertainment book coupon and were glad we did . <sssss> i had driven past it many times -lrb- my daughter 's pediatrician is across from it -rrb- but did n't try it since it did n't look exactly hip . <sssss> not that i go for that sort of thing but there was n't much to draw me in . <sssss> ah , the benefits of a 2-4-1 coupon ! <sssss> the inside is very warm and inviting , numerous rooms , little alcoves , and lots of seating . <sssss> it is much bigger than it looks from the outside . <sssss> free wi-fi and the baked goods are so good ! <sssss> after a visit there , this afternoon , i have been picking at one of their brownies ... ah so good . <sssss> there goes the diet but there 's always next week , right ? <sssss> we have only had their coffee and baked goods , but the sandwiches look really good . <sssss> one of these days , we 'll try them . <sssss> apparently they also have acts come and perform which is always fun at a coffee shop . <sssss> this place is on the corner of 3rd ave and mcdowell , and there is lots of windows , natural light , etc to enjoy the sights outside . <sssss> this is a charming , little spot and i am so glad i checked it out !
MID		this is more of a 4.5 start review . <sssss> boy , cherryblossom has really gotten their ish together . <sssss> the last few times i have gone have been really good . <sssss> service is alot better which has consistently been my beef with this place . <sssss> i have been impressed . <sssss> the food has always been good and the last two times i 've gone have been during lunch . <sssss> both times i have gotten the lunch bento special of the day and what a bento !!!! <sssss> for just under $ 10 , i got grilled salmon , a couple of potstickers , 4 pieces of california roll , a salad -lrb- sometimes the hot beef salad -rrb- . <sssss> i have also gotten tempura veggies with it , too , and it also comes with miso soup . <sssss> great deal !!! <sssss> on top of that , you always get ther rolls , bana bread , etc with it . <sssss> such a fan . <sssss> i ca n't wait for another day off that i can go there for lunch !
LOW		i have been dying to come here for bowling and today we headed down after lunch . <sssss> we parked in the garage under cityscape and got our ticket validated which was nice . <sssss> i noticed a sign near the entrance touting a $ 6 lunch and free game deal . <sssss> that is awesome and if i was lucky enough to work downtown , that would be such a fun thing to do on your lunch hour . <sssss> we were going to play one game which after two pairs of shoes had us at approx $ 17 . <sssss> yikes ! <sssss> luckily , my husband had this card that gave us an hour of bowling and shoes for free . <sssss> it turns out that we finished one game in 15 minutes . <sssss> i would have been pissed to pay $ 17 for 15-20 minutes . <sssss> my husband ordered a beer , me a water that tasted like flat sprite . <sssss> yuck when you are not expecting that . <sssss> the server rectified it very quickly , though . <sssss> i also ordered their pretzel snack that had 3 soft pretzel sticks with a trio of dips -lrb- cheese , mustard , and a garlic butter that intoxicated me with its smell -rrb- . <sssss> the app was $ 7 but i hear it is cheaper during happy hour -lrb- which they also have a reverse hh , by the way -rrb- . <sssss> my only beef with the app is it should be four instead of three pretzels since most people would split it with someone . <sssss> then you have the awkward `` who will take the last one , or do we split it ? '' <sssss> the game was pretty fun and i would recommend getting an hour if you are going with a group . <sssss> thirty minutes was about right for the two of us and was two games . <sssss> call me a traditionalist but i would have liked to see the `` tips '' on the monitor telling us how to achieve that unattainable split . <sssss> instead , we get how fast our ball goes down the lane which i suppose is good to know for some people . <sssss> overall , i enjoyed myself but again , the game was free . <sssss> for a brief moment , i thought it would be great to take the kids -lrb- during the day -rrb- but that would be very costly for a family of four to play 2 games . <sssss> i 'd like to come back at night and bowl then but i hear that it is extremely difficult to get a lane . <sssss> i have heard that it is still a cool place to hang out even if you ca n't get a lane so i 'll go again . <sssss> i ca n't wait to have those pretzel snacks again...day-um !
MID		this place sure is fun on a saturday night ! <sssss> no cover , stiff drinks , and kick ass music . <sssss> the main room is dance music with the next room playing hip-hop . <sssss> my girls and i danced our asses off last saturday and by midnight , this place was packed . <sssss> on thursday nights , that have a drag show but shortly after , it dies out flat . <sssss> such a shame because it would be great to continue the party there on a thursday night . <sssss> but , that 's okay , i still love getting my dance at this spot ! <sssss> you see people of all types here which is great . <sssss> everyone is there just to have a good time ...
MID		this place was alot of fun the moment we walked in . <sssss> walls lined with silly keychains , chapsticks flavors such as lucky charms , corn dog , betty crocker frosting , etc , toys for little and big kiddies , and lots of fun things for your kitchen -lrb- various designs of cupcake liners , coffee cube trays to make iced coffee , ice cube trays for fake teeth , brains , etc -rrb- . <sssss> my kind of place , for reals ! <sssss> they had old school candy , gum , etc and i had to pick up some bubble gum cigarettes . <sssss> got ta make sure i hide them from my kids ! <sssss> hubby and i took some pics in their photo booth -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- and that was fun . <sssss> they had a large variety of candy and little odds/ends toys which was fun to browse through . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and get some of their numbered sparklers for birthdays . <sssss> this is a great place for unique items and filling gift bags with old-school things . <sssss> they had the old school metal lunch boxes , too . <sssss> i would say this place is a little pricey but you can also find some good inexpensive buys .
MID		i wanted to give this place all 5 stars because i absolutely love hula , but i only gave it 4 because it has been inconsistent the 3 times i have been there . <sssss> my faves are the poke -lrb- incredible and i do n't even really eat that stuff -rrb- , ceviche , and the coconut shrimp rolls . <sssss> the ceviche has been inconsistent between having a ton of lime/citrus flavor to none at all . <sssss> i have had the ceviche all 3 times i have been there -lrb- and will continue to do so -rrb- so i am hoping that the dish becomes more consistent . <sssss> plus , the wontons that come with it have ranged from not being greasy , to being totally greasy . <sssss> -lrb- the totally greasy wontons were the same day as the completely bland ceviche so i was totally disappointed the last time i ordered this dish . <sssss> -rrb- as i mentioned , hopefully it gets more consistent . <sssss> the spicy seaweed salad was pretty good and so is their slaw . <sssss> things i did not like were the plantains , johnny cakes and pineapple wine . <sssss> i thought the pineapple wine would be a sweet desert wine , but weirdly , it was n't sweet but had hints of pineapple . <sssss> if you like the softer , sweeter version of plantains , this is for you . <sssss> i prefer the more thin , crisper plantains that are n't sweet . <sssss> it may seem like my experiences have been bad but they are n't . <sssss> i do n't expect to like everything on the menu but will continue to try new things and risk not liking it . <sssss> but the things that i do like keep bringing me back . <sssss> this is n't necessarily a place to bring kids , so my husband and i tend to order takeout . <sssss> when we have eaten there , however , we really enjoyed the atmosphere . <sssss> the owner is consistently there checking on various aspects and greeting the guests . <sssss> very friendly guy . <sssss> this place is a great addition to the central phoenix area .
MID		i stopped in here needing to kill some time before meeting my family for dinner at sapporo -lrb- across the parking lot -rrb- . <sssss> i always saw ads for this place in the scottsdale airpark magazine but never knew where it was . <sssss> lucky for me , i finally found it ! <sssss> there is dedicated parking in the front of the coffee shop so i parked there . <sssss> when i walked in , i was fairly stunned as it twice the size of most starbucks i have been in . <sssss> i was immediately welcomed by the employees behind the counter . <sssss> as i made my way to the counter , i kept trying to figure out where i was going to sit . <sssss> since there were a number of good spots , i decided to figure it out after i got my coffee . <sssss> the menu is expansive and includes the usual coffee drinks , pastries , sandwiches , quiche , etc. . <sssss> i settled for a small , vanilla iced coffee and a double chocolate chocolate chip cookie for just over $ 4 . <sssss> after i got my coffee , i wandered around looking for a spot . <sssss> i ended up in a back corner that housed a comfy tweed couch with knee height tables and ottoman stools . <sssss> across from it were long booths with tables and outlets under all of them . <sssss> in my corner , there was a bookshelf with used books and checkers . <sssss> as i was studying , i remember thinking how relaxed i was back there and how the music they played was good and varied . <sssss> not the typical sinatra or hip coffeehouse music they play at starbucks that annoys the living piss out of me . <sssss> although this place was so large , there was very much a comfortable feel about the place and the random corners of comfortable seating -lrb- couches , armchairs , etc -rrb- helped with that . <sssss> there is also outdoor seating too . <sssss> i really enjoyed my experience there and loved my cookie so much , i bought another one on the way out . <sssss> for the next day , of course , duh !
LOW		we came here last friday night because my husband has been raving about this place non-stop . <sssss> we waited about 15 min but there were some comfy wicker chairs out front . <sssss> once we were seated , we ordered a $ 14 bottle of cream sake . <sssss> it was extremely good and went down smooth . <sssss> we got about 8 servings out of the bottle . <sssss> having already had dinner earlier , we ordered a few apps : bacon-wrapped okra -lrb- 4 pieces for $ 5 -rrb- , panko shrimp -lrb- 3 shrimp hushpuppies for $ 8 -rrb- , and a side of 3 rice balls -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- which were crispy on the outside . <sssss> the panko shrimp came with a nice , spicy , sweet sauce with peanuts . <sssss> it was pretty good . <sssss> the bad : i had to ask for a water refill because our server disappeared , had to ask for soy sauce which i think it strange at an asian restaurant , and i felt the food was overpriced . <sssss> yes , i know tapas means small plates but i felt the portions were smaller than i have gotten at other tapas restaurants . <sssss> maybe i am spoiled from lola , who knows . <sssss> but , i gave it three stars because i did like this place but would n't go bananas for it .
LOW		my girlfriend and i were so excited to come here a few weeks ago since we have had fun in the past . <sssss> unfortunately , this time it was a bit of a letdown . <sssss> we got there at 6:30 pm and for an hour , it was $ 50 or $ 60 ... so expensive ! <sssss> not bad if there are a number of you but there was only two of us and that time , you have to purchase an hour . <sssss> okay , fine , not a big deal . <sssss> we sit down and our lane did n't work as the hour is ticking down . <sssss> you would think there is something that automatically notifies the employees that the lane has malfunctioned but i guess not . <sssss> i notified the girl and they moved us to lane 11 which is second from the last lane . <sssss> i know things happen , so that did n't really bother me . <sssss> as we are bowling though , we were so hot and sweating ! <sssss> i was practically parked by the fan on the equipment that cools your hands . <sssss> i started getting nauseous because i was so warm . <sssss> when i mentioned this to our server -lrb- because i was concerned the ac was broken on that end of the floor -rrb- , she agreed it was hot but that always happens when they raise the shades on the windows . <sssss> she said the windows get so hot that even when the sun sets , it keeps that side really warm . <sssss> i asked her to notify the manager because the heat had made us really uncomfortable . <sssss> she said she would but we never got a visit or apology from the manager . <sssss> frustrating . <sssss> if you know that is an issue then turn up the issue in that particular zone . <sssss> i do not expect to pay that much for an hour of bowling to sweat my ass off the whole time . <sssss> that is ridiculous . <sssss> on a positive note , the service was good and they had a great happy hour during the time we there . <sssss> for two apps and a beer , our bill was approx $ 10 . <sssss> i felt like that really balanced out the price of bowling during happy hour . <sssss> will i go back ? <sssss> likely . <sssss> but it is a shame that i 'll have to picky about what lane we go to which might limit our ability to even get a lane . <sssss> we 'll see ...
LOW		good lord , this place was lame on a saturday . <sssss> we went around 11:30 a.m. to eat lunch at moe 's southwest grill and which witch , and afterwards , we wanted to check out the shops . <sssss> a little after noon , only a handful of shops were open and those were pretty much only the big name shops . <sssss> even shops that had signs indicated they should be open , were n't . <sssss> i do n't know anything about retail shopping centers but it seems that westgate should regulate that . <sssss> as a result of so many shops being closed , we were bored out of our minds . <sssss> our 4 year old probably enjoyed herself the most on the splash pad . <sssss> i have been here before for a concert and it gets happening at night around the restaurants . <sssss> but retail shops , um not so much .
LOW		i have been here numerous times before and consistently liked it . <sssss> this time , i am soooo bummed out about the food . <sssss> we got here yesterday , 5 minutes after they opened and we were looking forward to hot , freshly made food . <sssss> was it hot and freshly made ? <sssss> hmmm , not so much . <sssss> the food looked good but when i took a bite , everything that should be fried was a little soggy and stale tasting . <sssss> and all of the food was lukewarm , not hot . <sssss> we ate some of their garlic blue crab and the shells were caked in garlic salt and brittle which concerns me . <sssss> the selection is varied , looks good and there is a lot to choose from . <sssss> but i do n't want to walk in a just opened restaraunt and eat food that tastes like it was microwaved from the night before . <sssss> yuck .
LOW		i have been wanting to come here forever and got a chance today due to the dine around event . <sssss> my friend and i ordered everything on the event menu : fried pork wontons with egg drop soup , egg rolls stuffed with cabbage and bbq pork , and orange chicken . <sssss> the meals came with tea , too . <sssss> due to the event , we were seated in a side room . <sssss> it was very drab and badly need of updating . <sssss> the cement floors were cracked and the bathrooms were scary . <sssss> the waitress was nice but neglected to ask us what we wanted to drink . <sssss> when she brought the food , we had to ask for water . <sssss> also despite knowing we were sharing , she did n't bring us any extra plates . <sssss> annoying . <sssss> one thing i forgot to add was when we first got there , we stood waiting in the lobby trying to figure out how to be seated . <sssss> there was a sign with an arrow to the dining room on the right for the event , but it did n't specify to seat yourself . <sssss> after seeing several employees at the register not ackowledge us , i finally asked what we should do . <sssss> then she told us to seat ourselves . <sssss> the food was good . <sssss> i especially liked the egg rolls and orange chicken . <sssss> the orange chicken was actually delicious . <sssss> although i liked the food . <sssss> it would n't be enough to bring me back . <sssss> the atmosphere and service , from beginning to end , left much to be desired . <sssss> food simply is n't enough to bring me back to a place if service is bad .
MID		brunch here has really become my favorite on the weekends . <sssss> my go-to is the matador and one of their $ 5 cocktails . <sssss> i love it . <sssss> it is a great place to come with kids , families and friends . <sssss> everything i have tried there , i really liked . <sssss> the green bloody mary my husband had was very unique ... tasted like green tomatillo salsa but very interesting . <sssss> at the end of your meal , the donut holes with mascarpone and jelly are a must ! <sssss> i seriously hate the valet parking though ...
HIG		man , i loved this pizza . <sssss> i drive past this place on 8th st and indian school every day and have been dying to try it . <sssss> finally , on a night the hubby was not home and i had the unappealing task of cooking something , i discovered i had a 2-4-1 coupon from the entertainment book . <sssss> to me , that is the best way to try something for the first time . <sssss> if i did n't like it , hey at least i did n't pay full price . <sssss> the coupon was for b1g1 free pizza , so we got two 14 '' -lrb- one pepperoni and one cheese -rrb- . <sssss> the total came out to $ 12.37 for both pizzas ... not bad . <sssss> it was your typical ny style pizza and i was pleasantly surprised that it was n't very greasy . <sssss> this was compared to the dripping with grease pizza we had at pinos al centro . <sssss> the crust on the pizza at mamma mia 's was also delicious . <sssss> a little bit chewy and not overly thin or thick ... just right . <sssss> each pizza yield approx 9 slices and i am excited that we 've got dinner tomorow night too ! <sssss> got ta love leftover pizza . <sssss> we parked in the back parking lot which can be accessed by a little side street . <sssss> getting to the location was n't bad until you start seeing all of the rush hour traffic backing up right at the intersection of 7th st and indian school . <sssss> but at 6:20 pm on a thursday , it did n't take me long to get in and out . <sssss> the employees were extremely friendly and the guy let me exit out the back , through their small kitchen , with the pizzas . <sssss> with a 2 yr old in my arms and 10 yr old behind me carrying the pizzas , i thought that was very nice . <sssss> i am pleasantly surprised to have a new local favorite pizza joint . <sssss> i love z pizza , but mamma mia has got it down for the traditional style pizza . <sssss> i seem to recall signs in the front saying something about 2 slices of pizza and a drink for approx $ 3 which is a smokin deal . <sssss> scared to tell the husband about that one since he may start to live there . <sssss> either way , i la-la-la-love it .
MID		this has become one of my favorite local spots . <sssss> i got take-out here once a year or so ago , but wanting to use our entertainment book coupons , we came twice recently . <sssss> we dined in the last two times and really enjoyed our meals . <sssss> the service is attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is very chill and low-key . <sssss> last night -lrb- thursday -rrb- , there was a blues performer alternating between his violin and guitar . <sssss> i have been to new orleans many times and having lived in the florida panhandle , i love , love love , anything with crawfish . <sssss> boy , do they do it right with their crawfish etouffee ! <sssss> fair warning that their food can be spicy but that is typical with that food genre . <sssss> i have had their seafood gumbo -lrb- chunky , spicy goodness -rrb- , jambalaya , fried catfish , fried shrimp ... everything is very good . <sssss> i particularly love their hushpuppies with the spicy remoulade sauce . <sssss> you can tell it has a lot of horseradish in it , which i love . <sssss> they also have great mixed drinks -lrb- my favorite is the creamsicle -rrb- and they have a good selection of louisiana beers . <sssss> i honestly think this restaurant is a great representation of cajun style food and feel lucky to have it my hood !
MID		last night we came here for dinner in the mood for teppanyaki and in an effort to avoid benihana . <sssss> we came a little after 5pm on a friday and it was packed . <sssss> luckily we made a reservation which you can do on their website . <sssss> very convenient . <sssss> once we were seated , the server went over the menu with us and explained it very well which was helpful . <sssss> the happy hour menu -lrb- until 7 -rrb- could be used all over the restaurant and included rolls , some apps , and even better meals from the teppenyaki menu . <sssss> for the reduction in price , the portion of the meats were reduced . <sssss> i ordered the shrimp with calamari steak off the happy hour menu -lrb- $ 16 -rrb- and i did not feel like i missed out by not ordering it off the regular menu -lrb- $ 24 -rrb- . <sssss> i had plenty of food when factoring in the salad , fried and veggies . <sssss> the teppan meals also come with miso soup but i was n't feelin it . <sssss> for drinks , my husband and i split a large sapporo -lrb- $ 4.75 -rrb- and we ordered a crispy calamari app that was pretty good . <sssss> the chef did the usual tricks which the kids at the table loved and i liked how he played to them . <sssss> it was fun and i actually saw some tricks i have never seen before . <sssss> i forgot to add that the meals came with a mango sorbet at the end that was very yummy . <sssss> the bill came out to $ 85 which included 2 drinks , 2 kids meals -lrb- that included their drinks -rrb- , an appetizer , a teppan meal from the happy hour menu , and a teppan meal from the regular menu . <sssss> for the amount of food we got , i thought it was good . <sssss> i also really enjoyed the music they played -lrb- usher , pitbull , etc -rrb- . <sssss> i had a great time on this friday night .
HIG		i rarely give 5 stars but lord , this place was good and brought me back to my latina roots . <sssss> we stayed at the squaw peak resort and used a coupon from the entertainment book . <sssss> despite this , we managed to shell out $ 70 including tip but that was because we wanted to try everything . <sssss> we had the shrimp ceviche salad -lrb- delicious -rrb- , combo appetizer platter that had some fried pork that tasted just like pernil -lrb- puerto-rican marinated pork roast -rrb- , fried yucca , fried plantain strips -lrb- my absolute favorite -rrb- and a number of other goodies . <sssss> they have kids meals so we ordered a pupusa plate filld with chicken and a side of rice and beans . <sssss> their rice is delicious , i had to order a side . <sssss> hubby ordered a combo that he thoroughly enjoyed and son ordered a carne asada plate . <sssss> everything was delicious and the server was just so friendly and quick to tell us all about the food . <sssss> she was awesome . <sssss> the restaurant is very non-descript and in an equally non-descript , virtually deserted shopping plaza at central and dunlap . <sssss> it is just past bombero 's so you can come here for dinner and then drinks at bombero 's . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back to this restaurant !
MID		nice , little spot we stopped in today after having lunch at pasand . <sssss> the employee was very friendly and decor was standard of a coffee shop . <sssss> despite being full from indian buffet , i ca n't help but try baked goods in a new spot . <sssss> for me , this was a soft-baked snickerdoodle , that was good . <sssss> i also had a small , non-fat pumpkin latte -lrb- yes , non-fat with the cookie ! <sssss> -rrb- that was equally enjoyable . <sssss> for a total of 2 cookies , a juice box , latte , double espresso , and small italian soda , it came out to a little over $ 10 . <sssss> not too shabby .
LOW		i finally made it down here with the family and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were seated on a friday night . <sssss> between four of us -lrb- 2 adults and 2 children -rrb- , we split a salad and two pizzas . <sssss> the salad was the pesto dressing house salad which had mixed greens , shaved parmesan cheese , nuts , and lord if i ca n't remember the rest . <sssss> it was very good though . <sssss> it was too bland for my husband but i thoroughly enjoyed it . <sssss> the pizza was di napoli and the crudo . <sssss> the white pizza was super greasy and too heavy for me . <sssss> the crudo was good but be warned that the salami was very spicy . <sssss> i had a glass of rose which was okay . <sssss> i tried to get the cioccolotini but they were out so we split a limoncello instead . <sssss> i loved the location and that it was a historic home . <sssss> that adds such character .
MID		wow , this was one of the best dinners i have had in a long time . <sssss> i definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that i have an entree that knocks my socks off . <sssss> for me , this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce . <sssss> my husband was surprised that i ordered this , since i do n't like mushrooms , and luckily for me , the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce . <sssss> the gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy . <sssss> i felt like i was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread . <sssss> omg . <sssss> we also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband 's . <sssss> they were just okay to me but overall , were decent . <sssss> we also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that i really liked . <sssss> we each had a glass of wine . <sssss> our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before i ordered it . <sssss> good thing i did because i did n't like it . <sssss> the server asked what kind of wine i liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which i enjoyed . <sssss> overall , before tip , our bill was $ 50 . <sssss> very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine . <sssss> this place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio . <sssss> there were two servers and on a busy fri night , service was slow . <sssss> but they were very nice and apologetic , so i gave them a break . <sssss> i noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space . <sssss> i was very impressed . <sssss> i can not wait to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing .
HIG		such a beautiful venue . <sssss> since october 2012 , i have been 3 times : once for the day of the day performance and twice for the nutcracker . <sssss> every time , i am wowed by this place . <sssss> the performances are beautiful , engaging and well done , employees are friendly , and i do n't think there is a bad seat in the house . <sssss> there is a gift shop , couple of bars , and bakery that serves coffee , as well . <sssss> i also like that there is a desk where you can check out a booster seat for small children . <sssss> very helpful .
MID		i first tried this during a recent yelp event and a couple fellow yelpers and i came back for happy hour and dinner . <sssss> i just love the feel of this place ; bright , wide open and different areas to sit . <sssss> their happy hour is daily , 3-close , $ 5 cocktails and mini pitchers . <sssss> i enjoyed my bar drinks . <sssss> i also ordered the soft pretzel with cheese dip -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- . <sssss> it was okay but i think what made it lackluster was the lukewarm dip . <sssss> disappointing . <sssss> i really enjoyed my pork chile pot pie -lrb- $ 9.50 -rrb- . <sssss> both of my friends ordered this too ! <sssss> mine had a lot of pork in it , my friend did not have hardly any , so that seemed inconsistent . <sssss> other than that , i still enjoyed everything . <sssss> it is a great addition to the area .
MID		i can see this place is going to be a new favorite . <sssss> after coming here for an event last week , a friend and i came back today for the dine around event . <sssss> i had the grilled tomato flatbread and goat cheese fondue . <sssss> both delicious . <sssss> i had to really restrain myself from getting another fondue since this was my first stop on the route . <sssss> too bad because i could eat alot of that stuff . <sssss> drinks are decent . <sssss> today i had a mimosa -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- and red and white sangria the other night . <sssss> the sangria is dangerous ! <sssss> one item on the menu i am anxious to try is their shrimp and grits with manchego -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . <sssss> oooh , that might be a visit tomorrow . <sssss> especially with the coupons the manager gave us .
MID		we came to this plaza to eat at baby kay 's to find out they were no longer there . <sssss> as we tried to figure out what next , we walked by pizzeria bianco and was like , is that what i think it is ???? <sssss> we had no idea they opened another location and were thrilled there was no line . <sssss> the weather was nice so we sat outside . <sssss> my husband and i each ordered a cocktail . <sssss> mine was the mojito which was just okay . <sssss> the antipasti we ordered as an app was amazing . <sssss> then again , we had just come from the gym and were starving ! <sssss> i stand by the amazing , though , although it should have included more cheese . <sssss> it had some parmesan , copa , brocolini , eggplant , yukon gold potatoes , mushrooms , and beets . <sssss> delicious . <sssss> i ordered the white pizza with arugula . <sssss> i enjoyed but it tasted as though lemon was squeezed over it . <sssss> lemon is not a flavor i like on anything including seafood and water . <sssss> i could have done without that but still liked . <sssss> my husband had the papparadelle . <sssss> the pasta was thick -lrb- think lasagna -rrb- but tasty . <sssss> so , for a kids milk , 2 cocktails , antipasti , a pizza , and the pasta , the bill was $ 76 ! <sssss> yikes ! <sssss> not for the faint of heart ...
HIG		this restaurant continues to be my go to spot for korean bbq since my review a couple of years ago . <sssss> every time we go , the restaurant is steadily full with a wide variety of patrons . <sssss> you can choose to cook at the table or have them cook for you . <sssss> usually we opt to cook at the table but a few nights ago , we decided to have them cook it for us . <sssss> same price . <sssss> usually , we opt for the $ 30 combo that has the daegi bulgogi , dalk gui , and the kalbi . <sssss> if i said it right , it is the spicy pork , chicken , and short ribs . <sssss> that is more than plenty for the 3 of us ... leftovers are the best ! <sssss> this last time , we each ordered a spicy pork plate at $ 13 each -lrb- my favorite and i do n't really eat spicy food -rrb- . <sssss> i felt like we looked like gluttons when the food came out . <sssss> very good portions . <sssss> i also love the panckak -lrb- sp ? <sssss> -rrb- they bring out with various items to enjoy with your meal . <sssss> my 5 year old demolished the white radishes and i had to fight her over the bean sprouts . <sssss> so good . <sssss> as always the service is friendly and attentive . <sssss> i have been to other korean bbqs where if you are n't in the same culture , you are n't treated the same . <sssss> not so with cgj . <sssss> i always enjoy my meal here . <sssss> inexpensive and delicious food .
MID		my husband and i took our 9 year old here for lunch . <sssss> it was our first time and were really hoping to like it . <sssss> well , we did . <sssss> we are huge fans of lgo and are happy to have another place like it closer to central phoenix . <sssss> for an appetizer we had the frito misto -lrb- calamari and rock shrimp -rrb- . <sssss> i was n't a fan of the shrimp but really liked the calamari . <sssss> i would have like the app to be less greasy but then again , maybe i should n't have ordered a fried appetizer . <sssss> the 3 of is split two of the small $ 10 pizzas -lrb- pepperoni and smokey - sans the olive tepanade because i hate olives -rrb- . <sssss> each of the pizzas had 6 slices and truly was plenty for the 3 of us . <sssss> we felt rather gluttonous after eating all of the pizza . <sssss> the pizzas were sooooo good ! <sssss> as i mentioned , we went during lunch but managed to get there before the rush . <sssss> i feel that we had good service and we really enjoyed our meal .
MID		i stayed here a few saturdays ago with some girlfriends and we had a great time . <sssss> i will say my lungs ached a bit after 24 hours , due to the smoke , but the casino was waaaay better than other smoky casinos i have been to . <sssss> we gambled alot and went to the club . <sssss> the music at the club was good and bad -lrb- baby got back ... really ????? <sssss> -rrb- but it was still really fun . <sssss> the late night bites at the fig restaurant was affordable and good . <sssss> although i have to question my decision to buy a greasy cheeseburger and fries at 1 am . <sssss> we stayed in one of the club level rooms and that was top-notch . <sssss> the views and accommodations were gorgeous . <sssss> we did have a bug problem but maintenance was responsive . <sssss> the club level lounge was a true treat . <sssss> it offers complimentary beer , wine , champagne , and light bites from 4-7 . <sssss> the light bites were california rolls , lo mein , egg rolls , veggie tray , chips and salsa , and mini desserts . <sssss> we got drunk and left with full bellies ... score ! <sssss> veronica , one of the conceirge staff , was simply amazing . <sssss> she was friendly , attentive , and accommodating . <sssss> the next morning , light breakfast was complimentary , too , in the lounge . <sssss> it was a choice of two quiches , cereal , oatmeal , a mango parfait , and fresh fruit . <sssss> i also really enjoyed the peet 's coffee espresso machine that made espresso , mochas , etc. . <sssss> and again , the service was impeccable . <sssss> i enjoyed the pool on sunday morning -lrb- when it was quiet -rrb- but not so much on saturday afternoon . <sssss> i was lucky to snag a lounge chair at 4 pm during their pool party amidst all of the `` reserved '' chairs for people that had been gone for hours . <sssss> there should be some preference towards guests over outside visitors . <sssss> plus , i laid out for almost an hour and not once did any wait staff come by . <sssss> i noticed they definitely catered to the rowdy groups of drinkers , though . <sssss> after walking to the bar , i found my pina colada to be reasonable priced at $ 8 and tasted delicious . <sssss> overall , great place to stay with no need to leave the premises once you are there .
MID		it was n't until going into frances , the other day , that my husband and i were stopped in our tracks with an amazing smell wafting from the prime nearby . <sssss> you know it has to smell good when it is after lunch and he is trying to talk me into stopping in for a `` small bite . '' <sssss> yeah right ! <sssss> well , when we looked at their menu last night , it was n't cutting our tastes and decided to go for china chili instead . <sssss> i 've tried this place before and it was so-so but i believe in second chances . <sssss> thank goodness for second chances . <sssss> we ordered this curry rice noodle dish mixed with chicken and shrimp . <sssss> that was my favorite part and reminded of the hamun noodle dish we used to get at the now-defunct big wong 's . <sssss> the dish was $ 9 and was enough for 3 adults . <sssss> we also had the bbq beef app -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- and the egg rolls -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- . <sssss> i was n't too much a fan of the egg rolls but everything else was great in my book . <sssss> total with a couple bucks tip was $ 20 . <sssss> i wonder how soon i can talk the husband into going back . <sssss> maybe right after our next lunch for a mid-afternoon snack ...
HIG		we attended this month 's third friday n + u event -lrb- free -rrb- at the heard and it was a blast ! <sssss> this month , it was capoeira and african drumming/dancing with an open bar and margaritas/street tacos in the cafe . <sssss> the event was entertaining , full of energy and my 3 year old and i danced for almost an hour . <sssss> my margaritas certainly did n't hurt ! <sssss> i had a great time and i am really looking forward to september 's event , jewelry and drinks !
MID		i am officially a junkie dammit , and i do n't like it one bit . <sssss> i have been twice in the past two days and am feeling terribly shameful about it . <sssss> although not too shameful to avoid the second trip ! <sssss> it used to be that i was thankful that the nearest coldstone was approx 10 min away and enough to deter me from the inevitable bingeing . <sssss> i have driven past mary coyle on numerous occasions as it is across the street from hana and that wonderful drive-thru sbux on the corner . <sssss> my husband finally brought home a wonderful little sundae surprise : a sundae with vanilla ice cream mixed with white chocolate chips , topped with whipped cream , lots of cocount shavings , a ridiculous amount of almonds all on top of a brownie . <sssss> i have never seen that many almonds on a sundae in my life . <sssss> it was a wonderful little -lrb- or should i say large -rrb- treat . <sssss> that was a month or so ago , and the last two days i have opted for mint chocolate chip ice cream , topped with whipped cream and hot fudge over a brownie -lrb- an ode to my favorite mint mint chocolate chocolate chip at coldstone -rrb- . <sssss> the prices for those sundaes are at least $ 8 and enough for two to eat . <sssss> pretty pricy as not alot of people are going to share . <sssss> and anyone comes near me and my mary coyles sundae is gon na get whopped in the head with my plastic spoon . <sssss> this place is definitely old school and has a drive-thru that kind of works . <sssss> but that is part of the charm , right ? <sssss> i am hoping that this is my last trip to mary coyle 's this week and now it 's time to take my ass to the gym .
HIG		i ca n't believe i am giving this place 5 stars but after two visits in one week , it is well worth it . <sssss> after buying one of those playing card decks with restaurant discounts , we finally tried spinato 's -lrb- after living in phoenix since 2003 -rrb- . <sssss> yes , i fully realize how ridiculous it is that i had n't been here sooner . <sssss> there are so many great things about this restaurant ranging from the service , food , deals -lrb- coupon and daily deals -rrb- , and conveniences -lrb- order ahead while waiting for a table -rrb- . <sssss> from the time we sat down -lrb- both visits -rrb- , the service was top-notch and friendly . <sssss> first visit , we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes -lrb- $ 15 for a medium -rrb- . <sssss> it was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball . <sssss> that was so good too ! <sssss> oh did i forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter . <sssss> both , simply amazing . <sssss> clearly i was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline . <sssss> i also had a glass of wine since they are half off on sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go . <sssss> for the second visit -lrb- a week later -rrb- , we dialed it back a bit . <sssss> of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread , kids ravioli -lrb- $ 5 for the ravioli , a breadstick , drink , and scoop of gelato -rrb- , small specialty pizza -lrb- $ 10 and plenty for my husband and son to share -rrb- and i had the `` lil '' spinach calzone -lrb- 7 '' for $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> that calzone was so delicious , i could n't save the half i set aside for lunch . <sssss> add two glasses of wine -lrb- half off -rrb- , and two piccola brownie desserts , and our total bill was $ 45 . <sssss> for a family of four with drinks , an appetizer and 2 desserts ???? <sssss> pretty damn reasonable in this day in age . <sssss> and it has been a long time since i was that blissfully satisfied with a meal -lrb- or two -rrb- . <sssss> well done spinato 's , well done .
LOW		wow , what a great space ! <sssss> i could absolutely see myself sitting here in a chair by the open window on a warm day . <sssss> loved the decor . <sssss> my husband and i came by after lunch at thai hut . <sssss> he talked me into a small honey vanilla latte . <sssss> to be honest , i was n't into the coffee . <sssss> the roast just is n't my style but i do think alot of people would like it . <sssss> my husband bought me one of their butter cookies that are intentionally very soft in the middle , almost like you are eating raw dough . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> not awesome , but definitely a butter cookie that i have never had like that before . <sssss> the middle tasted like cheesecake to me , for some reason , but i liked it . <sssss> i definitely prefer my cookies a little more cooked but i would say i enjoyed this cookie . <sssss> even though my experience was just okay , i look forward to returning . <sssss> the employees were friendly and i loved the atmosphere .
HIG		one of the managers at my job decided to treat us to flo 's for lunch yesterday . <sssss> i practically did cartwheels in my aisle because a -rrb- i was determined to eat out on my friday and b -rrb- i love flo 's . <sssss> i ca n't recall if anything i have eaten there was subpar . <sssss> i ordered the pepper bacon shrimp which is mixed with tomatos , cabbage , and bacon . <sssss> with this you can choose between white or brown rice , and it comes with their house salad . <sssss> the dressing is spicy and unique . <sssss> they also bring out wontons with a sweet and sour sauce . <sssss> between those and my affinity for chips and salsa , i will never have a six pack . <sssss> anyhoo , service there is speedy without you feeling rushed . <sssss> that place runs like a well-oiled machine . <sssss> it is nice when you go during your lunch hour because you are in and out within the hour , usually . <sssss> my husband says their mongolian beef is the best he has ever had and since he comes from the seattle with plenty of asian food , i believe him . <sssss> there lunches are on average $ 7-9 . <sssss> not bad considering the amount of food you get . <sssss> i can usually make a second meal with my leftovers . <sssss> i wish they would bring a flo 's down to central phoenix so i could have it more often .
HIG		i really love sidebar and its random location -lrb- above starbucks and pei-wei with the entrance on the side of the building -rrb- . <sssss> this is such a cute local spot with great techno/electro music and decor . <sssss> i love the random cult classic/b-movies that show , too . <sssss> the drinks are decent and if i recall , reasonably priced . <sssss> they have appetizers , too , but i have n't tried them . <sssss> i have been there a few times including new year 's for the upcoming 2009 . <sssss> everytime , i have really enjoyed myself . <sssss> there is a diverse group of people and i have never felt that people were snooty or pretentious . <sssss> for me , those are huge turn-offs at any place . <sssss> i ca n't say i would make the drive here if i did n't already live so close , but for a local spot , it is sa-weet .
MID		wow , what a great addition to the biltmore area ! <sssss> i love the layout with with all of the various shops tucked off to the side . <sssss> i went last sunday and it was n't too crazy . <sssss> there is a coffee shop , bakery/restaurant , a couple of clothing boutiques -lrb- including frances -rrb- , smeeks -lrb- closed its central ave location -rrb- , and a couple of home decor boutiques -lrb- including paris envy which closed it 's 7th ave location -rrb- . <sssss> there was also a really cool bicycle shop that had the funnest -lrb- sp ? <sssss> -rrb- helmets . <sssss> kind of pricy though at $ 60 but i still want one ! <sssss> the shop also had lots of bicycle accessories that made me consider the lack of baskets on my beach cruiser . <sssss> the thing i loved most about union is the ability to pop into the various local shops without having to drive a bunch of places . <sssss> it 's cozy and lots of trinkets to be found . <sssss> including a $ 3 toy i bought for my daughter that she lost soon after ! <sssss> : -rrb-
MID		i live within walking distance from the clarendon and ca n't believe i have n't been here yet . <sssss> yesterday , my husband lured me into skipping yoga to go get some mexican food here . <sssss> we took the family here for taco tuesday and during happy hour . <sssss> we ordered the $ 5 chirraron de queso -lrb- cheese cooked into a hard shell -rrb- -lrb- decent -rrb- , $ 5 guacamole -lrb- holy hell this was good -rrb- , $ 5 white sangria -lrb- decent -rrb- , chips and salsa -lrb- $ 3.5 -rrb- , a kids bean and cheese burrito -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- that was the side of my 3 year old 's head , and 8 mix-n-match tacos -lrb- pork , carne asada , shrimp , fish , veggie -rrb- . <sssss> for taco tuesday , they are buy 2 get 1 free , which is the deal we were given , but we would have saved more with the $ 1 off per taco during hh . <sssss> i ordered a shrimp taco and pork taco . <sssss> both were delicious but the pork taco really tickled my fancy . <sssss> the pork had that crispy bark on the outside which is my absolute favorite . <sssss> call it the puerto-rican in me but that is the best . <sssss> i really enjoyed my meal and the server was great . <sssss> i know i loved this place when i am trying to talk my husband into going back in a couple of days ...
HIG		easily , one of the best red velvet cakes i have had . <sssss> a few weeks ago , a co-worker picked up one of the cakes for a birthday . <sssss> the cake was moist and i was thrilled to encounter chocolate chips in the cake ! <sssss> wow . <sssss> i knew from a yelp event last year that they had small individual sizes so after having that red velvet cake , i made a beeline back to this shop . <sssss> i was crushed when i entered the store and did n't see any in the display , but no fear , they had some in the back . <sssss> as i looked around the shop , i noticed cute items for the kitchen -lrb- dish gloves , etc -rrb- . <sssss> regardless , my red velvet cake was deelicious !
HIG		after months of suggesting thai hut for take-out , i am finally fulfilled ! <sssss> i have been wanting to come back and eat but being the good wife , we have gone to other thai places to satisy my husband . <sssss> by this point , i finally put my foot down and said `` do not try to talk me out of thai hut !!! '' <sssss> -lrb- true story , ask my husband . <sssss> -rrb- i pretty much only get one thing here , the garlic pepper chicken -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- . <sssss> considering i hate pepper in my food , this dish is delicious to me -lrb- hence why i am loyal to it -rrb- . <sssss> it is chopped chicken mixed with cabbage , broccoli , carrots with a nice garlicky broth . <sssss> they give a pile of white rice with it , too , which is just perfect . <sssss> if i put my mind to it , i can easily polish off most of this dish . <sssss> well , maybe the lunch size which is still a good portion . <sssss> with the lunch , i can make a second meal . <sssss> with a dinner , i had plenty for dinner and was able to split the rest into two lunches . <sssss> sweet ! <sssss> garlic pepper chicken two more meals ????? <sssss> it does n't get any better than that . <sssss> if you have a chance to eat-in , try and score a window table facing mcdowell ... great people watching and views of the city streets . <sssss> i just love it !
HIG		so far , i have been to lola twice -lrb- a saturday night and monday morning -rrb- . <sssss> saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy monday morning . <sssss> free wi-fi , coffee , baked goods , and awesome location ... you ca n't beat it . <sssss> the morning we went , we had a monterrey jack scone that was really good . <sssss> i laughed when i got my latte in a `` so i married an axe murder '' - esque cup . <sssss> we sat along the high tables facing central ave and i really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards central . <sssss> there are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables . <sssss> i really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular , you 'll never get to sit there . <sssss> that is why i stopped going to lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time . <sssss> my favorite part of lola coffee is being right on central and watching traffic and the light rail go past . <sssss> love it , love it .
MID		i dug my latest experience here friday night . <sssss> i had n't been by in a few years but lola coffee had locked their doors at 8:30 pm -lrb- wtf ??? <sssss> -rrb- , so lucky for me , lux is right down the street . <sssss> it was n't too busy although there was a very steady stream of people in and out . <sssss> i had a small , non-fat sugar free vanilla latte -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- and picked up a homemade , oatmeal creme sandwich for $ 3 . <sssss> pluses : i love the msmatched , kind-of random decor that makes you feel very comfortable . <sssss> free wifi , and a wide variety of baked goods . <sssss> i can always be sold on baked goods . <sssss> this might be a weird plus , but i was totally loving their ice water with fresh oranges inside . <sssss> i am probably the only person that never had this before , but who cares , i loved it . <sssss> totally refreshing on a hot az night . <sssss> neutral : the employees were n't exactly friendly but were n't rude , either ... just kind of indifferent . <sssss> hmmm , correct that , they were very friendly with the regulars but i sort-of felt unwelcome at first but i quickly got over that . <sssss> negatives : the music is too loud . <sssss> maybe that was intentional towards the end of the night but i was having an extremely difficult time focusing on what i was studying . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , i loved the music but it was a bit much . <sssss> okay , alot much . <sssss> bottom line , this is still a great little local coffee shop and i might be stopping here instead of lola next time ...
MID		so , i feel like i should n't have liked this place as much as i did but this place was fun as hell ! <sssss> i was sober , too , so that gives me a shred of credibility ! <sssss> this was our last stop on our date night and we were going to do the walk-by thing and see what was up . <sssss> as we approached -lrb- 11:30 pm on a sat night -rrb- , i could hear the dance music pumping , see alot of people in the front which were encouraging signs . <sssss> there was no cover and it was n't overly crowded . <sssss> i felt like the mix of people were the standard downtown crowd which was a mix of everything ! <sssss> i had to love the people dressed in 80 's clothes and the guy with the mullet wig . <sssss> we had a vodka tonic and two shots which came out to $ 19 ... not bad . <sssss> i really loved the music and attempted to dance off the padre 's we had for dinner . <sssss> this place is literally an extension of the san carlos hotel lobby so the room with the dj and dance floor was all carpeted , remniscent of banquet rooms . <sssss> but other than the carpeted dance floor , it was a really fun place . <sssss> the entrance towards the bar was marble floors with a chandelier overhead -lrb- hotel decor -rrb- and there were a few touches to fit with the haunted theme -lrb- since hotel san carlos is haunted -rrb- . <sssss> do n't come here expecting it to be a fancy bar/club . <sssss> some things were a little cliche and cheesy but i thought that made it fun .
MID		although a number of halloween stores begin cropping up over the holiday , i think it is always good to try and support the local businesses . <sssss> i had an idea of what i was going to dress up for halloween but in typical fashion , i changed my mind a few days before the halloween party . <sssss> easley 's has practically anything you might need even though how dare they not have my rocky horror picture show costume . <sssss> the absolute nerve ! <sssss> i quickly found some good substitutes and the shop was running very efficiently . <sssss> there were many employees around although i encountered major attitude/rudeness by one of the temporary employees manning the fitting rooms . <sssss> other than that bs , i found the employees to be very helpful and willing to help . <sssss> you can get all types of costume make-up here , accessories galore -lrb- i got a rhinestone feather duster for my magenta costume ... cool -rrb- , and of course , the wide range of costumes are amazing . <sssss> you can be a giant banana , lady gaga , gorilla costume with a toga -lrb- party animal -rrb- , and typical superheroes/occupation costumes . <sssss> i got ta say , too , that easley 's is extremely reasonably priced . <sssss> my costume was $ 25 , wig $ 15 and feather duster $ 5 . <sssss> that 's not bad considering i got a wig and additional accessories with the costume . <sssss> beware , though , there is no refund/return policy in case you change your mind . <sssss> and hey , after you work up an appetite , head to zoe 's right next door !
MID		i came here yesterday for a spagirls event . <sssss> the normal $ 35 blowdry was $ 25 . <sssss> located in the scottsdale quarter , i parked in the south garage which was just off the side street drybar was located . <sssss> it did n't take me long to locate it and it was a very short walk from the garage . <sssss> the decor was light and nicely done . <sssss> on saturdays and sundays , they have champagne and dessert until 2pm so i had a couple of mimosas during my time there . <sssss> my appt was at 2pm but they got me in 15 minutes early which was nice . <sssss> when they took me back , christine washed my hair and talked to me about the conditioning shot for my hair . <sssss> for $ 20 , it is supposed to last for 6 weeks . <sssss> i thought , why not , since summer is coming and my coarse hair is about to get drier . <sssss> i asked christine to do what i think is called `` straight up '' which is stick straight . <sssss> since my hair is really thick , it took her awhile but she did a fantastic job ! <sssss> i have honestly never seen my hair look this good . <sssss> my girlfriend went too and i never saw her curly hair look that good straight . <sssss> she had her ends curled whereas i did mine all straight but both of our hair looked awesome . <sssss> when i got home and went to work , i received many compliments . <sssss> i felt the staff was very friendly and i would definitely go back . <sssss> they have packages like 3 blowdrys for $ 100 which saves some $ . <sssss> i would n't go to drybar all of the time but for a girl with curly hair , it is a nice indulgence to have someone blowdry and style it straight for me . <sssss> love it !!
HIG		i finally joined this gym after weeks of agonizing over the monthly rates . <sssss> i was having a hard time justifying the approx $ 80/mos fee . <sssss> turns out , i did n't have to stress that hard since i got a decent rate already being a gold 's gym member in the north scottsdale gym . <sssss> because i was already a member , my new rate was $ 50/mos and even though my husband was not a member , he got that rate , too . <sssss> that might seem like alot but the hot yoga classes were a major factor for me . <sssss> even though they only offer one hot yoga class per week , they will be increasing the frequency due to the popularity . <sssss> so , in my opinion , i am getting unlimited hot yoga per month for an added $ 25 to my existing gym membership . <sssss> way , way worth it to me when i factor in bikram yoga 's rates . <sssss> there are a number of features to this gym that other reviews have already mentioned . <sssss> they have individual spinning bikes that have individual screens allowing you to use a digital spin instructor . <sssss> this is great if you ca n't make it to their live spin classes . <sssss> all of the cardio machines have tvs that you can plug your headphones in . <sssss> the employees actively seek suggestions to add machines they do n't already have . <sssss> members are also offered a workout towel and shower towel so you do n't have to bring one . <sssss> i like the option of the validated parking -lrb- 2 hours -rrb- . <sssss> if i want to go to an event downtown , i can fit in a short workout , shower , and then leave my car in the garage for whatever time i have left in the garage . <sssss> i 'm not sure how busy the gym will get after awhile , but for now , i am enjoying the easy and quick access to any of the machines . <sssss> lots of people-watching and nice views are to be had working out by the windows ... you ca n't beat it .
MID		my girlfriends and i came last week to watch bridesmaids on a thursday night . <sssss> we bought the tickets online to reserve our seats . <sssss> the $ 17 seats -lrb- personal wait staff , free popcorn , pillow and blanket -rrb- were sold out , so we got the $ 14 seats . <sssss> this place is located on the second floor by narcisse and next to tanzy -lrb- shares a lobby by the concession stand -rrb- . <sssss> that place was packed ! <sssss> the decor is posh and upscale , club-like , with plush seating throughout . <sssss> we got in line to get some food and were in line forever !!!!! <sssss> there was only one cashier and it took so long to get through . <sssss> annoying when trying to make the start of the movie . <sssss> anyway , they had a variery of hot food you could order , beer/wine , typical movie snacks , and a display case with additional snack foods -lrb- cheese/fruit , hummus and chips , tiramisu , salad , etc -rrb- . <sssss> my chips and hummus were $ 9 but i expected it to be a little pricy . <sssss> to be honest , i was n't digging the chips at all and would have preferred pita bread or pita chips . <sssss> the leather seats were very comfortable and i liked the tray table that could be moved however you like . <sssss> we really enjoyed ourselves and i think the experience was worth the cost of the ticket . <sssss> they need to become a little more streamlined in the handling of their concession stand , though .
MID		i really love this hotel and i have never even stayed in the rooms . <sssss> not only is their restaurant , gallo blanco , one of my favorites in phoenix , but every wednesday , they have flamenco music/dancers from 7-9 . <sssss> those nights get packed and are alot of fun/high energy . <sssss> i have taken friends and family on wednesday and they enjoyed the performance as much as i do . <sssss> last weekend , we used their pool . <sssss> we live within walking distance , and have a pool too , but hey , nothing beats having drinks served to you ! <sssss> . <sssss> we got there around 2 and it was packed ! <sssss> no matter as they had fake grass laid out around the pool and we set up camp on one in a shaded spot . <sssss> all around the pool are these fragrant blossoms , trees , variety of lounge chairs , couches , beds , and chill music playing . <sssss> so relaxing . <sssss> the server came around frequently and another employee came out handing out free otter pops and bottled water . <sssss> so awesome ! <sssss> you could also order food from the restaurant . <sssss> my husband , daughter , and i had an awesome time . <sssss> there was a good mix of families , singles , gays , friends , etc. . <sssss> we felt very comfortable there and see lots of fun to be had in the summer ! <sssss> one note , be careful around the cool looking blue glass in the cement around the pool . <sssss> some of it had broken off and gotten in my foot . <sssss> not very cool when people are walking around barefoot and with kids around .
MID		after last night at cmye phoenix city grille , the husband and i were n't in any condition to cook dinner tonight . <sssss> we started flipping through the entertainment book to see where we might go for dinner . <sssss> it has been a long time since we have been and paella sounded damn good for my hangover . <sssss> we got there around 6pm and was maybe the fourth table there . <sssss> i ordered a pina colada and the husband had wine . <sssss> i really liked the pina colada and the fried calamari that was very tender . <sssss> no one likes overly chewy calamari . <sssss> for dinner , i had the paella valenciana -lrb- the typical paella dish , $ 28 -rrb- and my husband had the paella negra -lrb- black rice with lobster , calamari , shrimp , chicken , etc , $ 32 -rrb- . <sssss> both dishes were delicious and each were more than enough to split between two people . <sssss> the next time we go , we would probably split one paella . <sssss> we were using a bogo deal , so it made sense to get the two and have dinner for another night . <sssss> as we were wrapping up dinner , the band began playing and shortly thereafter , the flamenco dancer came on . <sssss> the music and flamenco performance was so great and really added to the experience . <sssss> by this time , the restaurant was packed and our 3 year old was having a blast trying to dance like the flamenco dancer . <sssss> after they played their set -lrb- 30 minutes -rrb- , the singers and dancer walked around to talk with the patrons . <sssss> very cool . <sssss> overall , the drinks were good , food was good , service was good , and so were the musicians . <sssss> really great time and looking forward to the next !
HIG		i was so blown away by my recent meal here and could safely say it was the best korean bbq i 've had . <sssss> we came using a buy with me certificate and ordered a combo that had three kinds of meats -lrb- spicy pork , beef , and chicken -rrb- for $ 30 . <sssss> that and an order of gyoza easily fed three of us and could have fed four people . <sssss> the atmosphere was very comfortable with friendly service . <sssss> i kept groaning in pleasure every time i ate the spicy pork . <sssss> i even resorted to pulling burnt bits off the grill plan with my chopsticks , it was so good . <sssss> at the end , we tried the coconut boba frappe which was delicious . <sssss> i never had boba before and the coconut one was just right . <sssss> do yourself a favor and try this little spot !
MID		i do n't why i wanted to come so bad , because i 'm not generally into chicken fried steak , but sometimes you get a craving , ya know ? <sssss> finally , we had a chance and took the family . <sssss> this place is at the corner of 16th st and bethany home and the parking lot can be slightly awkward . <sssss> i think we went on a thurs night and they had dinner chicken and dumplings -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- for one of the daily specials . <sssss> i really wanted chicken fried steak -lrb- $ 12.50 -rrb- but what in the hell was i going to do with all the steak i heard they give you ? <sssss> um , no . <sssss> i did manage to convince my husband to share some of his even though he insisted he was going to eat the entire thing . <sssss> mind you , this was before we saw the portions ! <sssss> so , the hubby ordered the chick fried steak , me the chick-n-dumplings , son ordered tke kids cheeseburger -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- and 3 year old shared our food . <sssss> we also had the fried okra app that was so good . <sssss> breaded just right , tender and with a horseradish-type sauce . <sssss> yum . <sssss> when the food came out , i was laughing so hard at how large the chicken fried steak was . <sssss> needless to say , my husband was not eating that whole thing . <sssss> he was n't a huge fan of it , but i was . <sssss> i thought it was flavored well and i really liked the batter -lrb- think a light beer batter -rrb- . <sssss> my chicken and dumplings were awesome . <sssss> the chicken was plentiful and tender , within the white gravy , and biscuits soft . <sssss> it came with a side of buttered corn , too , which were good . <sssss> oh yeah , my meal came with a choice of salad or slaw . <sssss> i chose the slaw which was creamy , just the way i like it . <sssss> the kids burger was good , and it was neat because it also comes with an individually packaged , small blue bell ice cream scoop . <sssss> th kids loved that . <sssss> the service was great , too . <sssss> the server was friendly in addition to the other staff . <sssss> would i come back for the chicken fried steak ? <sssss> maybe not , but i definitely would for the chicken and dumplings . <sssss> maybe after i sweat enough calories at bikram yoga !
MID		i have only been to fez 3-4 times but i am cuh-razy for their rosemary fries and their bread plate with the pesto dip , tomato sauce , and something else i ca n't recall . <sssss> my favorite thing to drink there is the pomegranate margarita ... that one drink kicks my ass every time . <sssss> i love the atmosphere and it is always pretty happening with a diverse group of people .
LOW		sorry , mary coyle , i am officially over you . <sssss> i have been a few times since my last review and your portion sizes are too inconsistent with your prices . <sssss> i have gotten either twice the amount or half the amount of sundae for approximately the same price over the last few times . <sssss> last night was the last straw . <sssss> for a small scoop of mint choco chip ice cream over a brownie , some whipped cream , and hot fudge , i paid $ 8.47 . <sssss> i gave you two stars because the sundae tasted good but i am not willing to come back and pay those prices for something i can get a couple of dollars less down the street . <sssss> see ya ...
MID		i really like this restaurant and previously had just gone to their arcadia location . <sssss> the scottsdale location is close to work so i gave it a try with an deal i bought -lrb- which reminds me that i have one more left ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i got the same thing that i order at the other location : mediterranean omelet with egg whites -lrb- no extra charge -rrb- , spinach and feta . <sssss> i was happy to see that the preperation was consistent . <sssss> i also ordered the 1/2 brioche french toast . <sssss> god , it was delicious . <sssss> thank goodness for the healthier omelet . <sssss> service was great -lrb- i went at lunchtime during the week -rrb- and very attentive . <sssss> i would definitely go back . <sssss> my bill was just under $ 14 so i was pleased .
HIG		oh al-hana , your garlic sauce will be the end of me . <sssss> this little spot in the baiz market is not located in the best part of town but is truly a gem . <sssss> my husband loves their schwarma sandwiches and i always get the chicken ta-ook -lrb- i apologize profusely for the atrocious spelling -rrb- . <sssss> i also love the tabouli . <sssss> we have also had their meat and cheese pies which are pretty good . <sssss> they have really good hummus and babaganoush . <sssss> the garlic sauce that comes with it is to die for and i always want to eat ungodly amounts of it . <sssss> pita bread and garlic sauce ... that could be my meal in itself . <sssss> love it . <sssss> i always like picking up a packages of pita bread while we are there . <sssss> i think we spend less than $ 1 for a pack of 6 pitas . <sssss> crazy cheap ! <sssss> would i go to baiz to buy groceries ? <sssss> not so much but we definitely make the drive for al-hana .
HIG		i do n't even know why i am addicted to this place but i am . <sssss> i unequivocably love sweet tomatoes . <sssss> this buffet is great for fresh food and the ability to dine healthy if you want . <sssss> i also love that our 2 year old can eat healthy for free . <sssss> for salads , you can choose from pre-made salads or create your own . <sssss> there is also a food theme depending on the time of the month which determines the specialty salads , soups , pasta , etc. . <sssss> there are usually 4-5 types of soups , baked potato , sweet potatoes , 2 types of pasta , muffins , breads , baked desserts , fruits , and ice cream . <sssss> my favorites are the homemade chicken noodle soup , their foccacia style sliced bread -lrb- so wonderfully garlicky -rrb- and their freaking lava cake . <sssss> their lava cake is always the end of me even when i try to eat reasonably . <sssss> what is also great for you sweet-tooth people , are the servers bringing around freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . <sssss> ah , sweet heaven ... or should i say , sweet tomatoes ...
MID		thank goodness this place has occupied the unfortunate corner of short-lived restaurants . <sssss> there is nothing worse than giving a place a chance , getting attached to it and then it shutting down shortly thereafter . <sssss> luckily , america 's taco shop has a loyal following and i sincerely hope it stays put in the 7th ave location . <sssss> last night was my 4th time here and it grows on me more and more . <sssss> had i wrote this review the first time i went -lrb- 7th st location -rrb- , i think i would have given it 3 stars . <sssss> i mean , to state that it has the best carne asada ? <sssss> i still would n't go that far but i always enjoy my food . <sssss> last night , i had a carne asada taco , pastor taco , and chips/salsa/guacamole . <sssss> i love pastor tacos but am not a fan of theirs . <sssss> they add pineapple to theirs which is my thing . <sssss> i love pineapple alone , not warm with food . <sssss> again , not my thing . <sssss> i have had their carne asada tostada in the past . <sssss> i was a little turned by the warm , wilted lettuce on top but i guess that is what happens when it is wrapped with foil . <sssss> but the tostada was okay . <sssss> their bean and cheese burritos are awesome . <sssss> it is so simple but the flavor is really good ... love it . <sssss> i have n't eaten there in person -lrb- we always get take-out -rrb- but from the outside , the restaurant is adorable and oh-so inviting . <sssss> my daughter 's day care is right across the street and this place is always busy . <sssss> good sign ...
MID		this place is great ! <sssss> i took the kids here after a day at the phoenix children 's museum and got some ice cream . <sssss> my son had a coke float , daughter had a scopp of ice cream and i had a hot fudge sundae . <sssss> holly hell , that hot fudge sundae was as big as my head ! <sssss> and i loved every bit of it . <sssss> you walk through an antique room to get to the restaurant and then there is a vintage/antique store connected on the other side , too . <sssss> after the ice cream , we wandered around and looked at all of the cool stuff for it . <sssss> unfortunately , my four year old is like an elephant in a china store , so i could n't exactly relax . <sssss> the next day , i came back and picked up some reasonably priced vintage/thrift store dresses around $ 20 a piece . <sssss> the black dress was perfect for a 20 's party i attended and the second dress was a long sleeved , low cut , long red dress with yellow flowers that i am wearing today for a halloween party . <sssss> ice cream and antiques are the way to spend the day !
HIG		we came here to satisy my sweet tooth and given that i am done with mary coyle . <sssss> i had only been here once before to get coffee and always meant to come back . <sssss> boy , am i glad i did ! <sssss> after dinner , the four of us took a walk down to pink spot . <sssss> i took a look at their menu online so i knew what i wanted . <sssss> i ordered the one scoop black-n-white sundae but substituted mint choco chip ice cream . <sssss> it was great . <sssss> the girl layered the brownie , hot fudge , and mint chocolate all the way to the top of the cup and topped it with whipped cream and nuts . <sssss> i loved the multiple layers . <sssss> we also got a chocolate covered banana for my husband -lrb- which caused endless jokes from me ... could not resist ! <sssss> -rrb- , and two kids ' ice cream scoops . <sssss> the total ? <sssss> $ 11 . <sssss> pretty shocking given i just spent a little over $ 8 for one regular ice cream sundae the other night at mary coyle . <sssss> everything was really good and the best part was we could burn calories walking to and from pink spot . <sssss> on the way out of this place , my husband noticed that they do bagel boxes -lrb- dozen bagels -rrb- for about $ 13 so i 'll definitely need to come here when i want to bring bagels for the office . <sssss> i would much rather support the local business than go to einstein 's for bagel buckets .
HIG		i freakin love the hell out of this place . <sssss> with my previously passed dog , i used to take him for the self-wash which ranges from $ 11 , i think to $ 17 . <sssss> this depends on the shampoo , etc that you use . <sssss> there are blowers to dry your pets , too . <sssss> for my newest dog , who does n't need as frequent baths , i take her often for the nail trims . <sssss> her nails grow so fast and it is convenient to walk in and get nails clipped for $ 8 . <sssss> i think i get more excited at the prospect of buying her treats at the bakery counter . <sssss> there is a great variety of biscuits , cookies , etc , and i love that they have `` muffins '' and `` cupcakes '' for your pets . <sssss> there is also a plenty of pet food , toys , and gear . <sssss> we also picked up some spray for shedding and sour apple spray for our puppy 's chewing . <sssss> they have a rewards card that sends you 5 % when you spend $ 500 . <sssss> wag-n-wash is definitely a one stop shop for pet owners !
MID		i always see a lot of my friends checking in here so i thought it was time to check it out . <sssss> my husband loved it more than me , but i thought it was decent . <sssss> i ordered one of the omelet specials which was really good . <sssss> it came with carmelized peaches on the side which were good but the cinnamon sauce/syrup had run all under my omelet . <sssss> i tried to eat around the egg parts that had n't absorbed the sauce but it was difficult . <sssss> maybe i am weird but i like some of those foods kept really separate . <sssss> my daughter had a blueberry pancake which was really good . <sssss> it seemed like they made it in a cast iron skillet which lended to the yummy cooked edges . <sssss> my husband 's omelet was good too .
LOW		after a recent trip to seattle , my husband has been on an asian food kick which encouraged him to finally try this place . <sssss> on his 3rd or 4th time eating there , he convinced me to order take-out . <sssss> normally , it had n't taken long to get his food in the past but this time , we sat in the parking lot for over a half hour . <sssss> apparently , everyone had to wait awhile . <sssss> i ordered the chicken/shrimp fried rice that was extremely flavorless and dry . <sssss> so disappointing as i have n't had a good fried rice in awhile . <sssss> my husband ordered banh-mi , spring rolls and another app that you basically put together -lrb- pork , vermicelli noodles , lettuce -rrb- . <sssss> i loved the banh-mi which was a sandwhich on a type of hoagie roll with pork , mayo , shredded carrot , cucumber and peppers . <sssss> i was so surprised at how much i loved the sandwhich . <sssss> the sandwiches are $ 2.25 and our whole bill was approx $ 17 . <sssss> i did n't exactly enjoy my meal but i think this place is definitely worth a try . <sssss> everyone has their off nights , right ?
LOW		generic soup , salad , sandwich place with lots of options . <sssss> i picked a soup and half sandwich combo , with the turkey avocado panini and chicken tortilla soup . <sssss> the sandwich looked so unappealing and did n't taste much better than that . <sssss> the soup was decent . <sssss> i liked the chocolate covered strawberry ... was n't expecting that . <sssss> i think this is a good addition to the plaza , but i would rather go to the biltmore for paradise bakery .
HIG		i absolutely love this place and truly wished i lived closer . <sssss> i am a big fan of outdoor malls and there is something for almost everyone here . <sssss> i say almost because there is only one store that my husband is interested in shopping in . <sssss> but ... this review is about me not him ! <sssss> ; -rrb- for me , i love the mix of more well-known clothing stores and local boutiques . <sssss> i love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as paradise bakery , chipotle , coldstone creamery , etc. . <sssss> in the summer , they have the misters going and in the winter , it is the fireplace . <sssss> there is also a harkins movie theater . <sssss> apart from the middle strip of shops , i like that i can hit up a target , ulta , bevmo in one stop . <sssss> who cares if i need to drive across the marketplace , the key thing is that i do n't have to drive across town to find shops that are all in one place ... so convenient . <sssss> i do n't get the parking complaints from other reviewers . <sssss> how is that the fault of the marketplace ? <sssss> there is an over-abundance of parking spots , but it can be hard to find a spot due its popularity . <sssss> if you are a bargain shopper , you can go to their website and print out coupons for its shops . <sssss> my husband and daughter got bogo frozen yogurt from mojo yogurt today . <sssss> there is also a little splash pad in the middle of the shops that is great for the little ones . <sssss> this is a great place to cover anything you might need .
HIG		i have n't been to zoe 's for probably a year but i always love it when i come ! <sssss> as i typically do , i recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions , and your choice of a side -lrb- i chose their rice-yummy -rrb- and their greek salad . <sssss> the salad is always huge so i usually save it for its own meal later . <sssss> their salad comes with their signature vinaigrette which is soooooo good . <sssss> we also got a pre-packaged side of their red potato salad which is good , itself , but i like to put the dressing on it , too . <sssss> my husband got the tuna pita and thought it was awesome . <sssss> my brother went for the mediterranean pita and raved about it , too . <sssss> the food is fresh and you feel you are eating healthy . <sssss> the prices are average for most places , nowadays and i think the grilled chicken plate at approx $ 7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it . <sssss> oh yeah , their fountain lemonade was out when i went but my husband recommended i try their freshly squeezed limeade behind the counter . <sssss> i am a huge fan of limes and this was absolutely delicious . <sssss> not too tart or too sweet , just perfect . <sssss> love , love , love zoes .
MID		i stopped by here today on my way to the unfortunately closed rowdy boutique . <sssss> i figure what better way to cure my shopper woes by stuffing my face with a chocolate cupcake ? <sssss> okay , we got more than that but i had good intentions to stop at one . <sssss> anyways , for me , we got the milk chocolate chip cookie , brown velvet cupcake and chocolate cupcake . <sssss> for hubby , we got the urban cookie -lrb- dark chocolate , coconut , and oatmeal -rrb- , their speciality cookie : cherry , and a carrot cupcake . <sssss> the cookies are $ 1.79 and cupcakes $ 1.99 . <sssss> all i have eaten thus far is the chocolate cupcake and oh man , it was heaven . <sssss> the cake was very moist and the frosting was lick off my fingers delicious . <sssss> it tasted like a dark chocolate frosting so a hint of that dark chocolate bitterness . <sssss> yum , yum , yum . <sssss> now , i wonder if my husband will remember that he has a carrot cupcake or miss it if i snatch it up ??? <sssss> i suppose it is a little expensive but well worth it for those once in a while indulgences or to surprise someone with a sweet treat . <sssss> and sweet treat , it was ...
LOW		my husband and i came to celebrate the end of his mba program . <sssss> he is a major steak lover and loves these kinds of places but neither of us had ever been . <sssss> we had a reservation and were seated very promptly by the manager . <sssss> the server also had a slip of paper with our last names and greeted us as such . <sssss> we had two servers , jane and i ca n't remember the guy 's name . <sssss> jane had her spiel down -lrb- as i heard her repeat it to the table behind us -rrb- and was somewhat likeable . <sssss> i found her off-putting at times such as when she acted caught off-guard when i ordered an appetizer as my dinner . <sssss> then she smiled at me in an all-knowing way as if i was one of `` those '' girls ordering something small for dinner . <sssss> i did n't say anything but my husband caught on as he said something about it after she left the table . <sssss> then later i overheard her jokingly ask a gay male couple seated by us `` who is the mrs ? '' <sssss> when presenting their bill . <sssss> that rubbed me wrong way , too , but maybe i was being sensitive . <sssss> anyway , they brought a large warm onion loaf of bread . <sssss> it was okay ... i ate several pieces . <sssss> for dinner , we had the clams casino appetizer -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , for my meal i had the baked prime platter -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , my husband had the cajun ribeye -lrb- $ 47 -rrb- , bacon and onion mac-n-cheese -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- and parmesan truffle fries -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- . <sssss> everything was very good except the fries because they never brought it out ! <sssss> it was on the bill , though , so i am not sure what happened there . <sssss> they took it off when we brought it to their attention . <sssss> oh , that reminds me , jane and the other server apologized for the oversight but jane took it one step further by saying that at least it was n't her mistake . <sssss> tacky . <sssss> my baked seafood platter consisted of one breaded large shrimp , one bacon wrapped scallop , one oysters rockerfeller , and one small lump crab cake . <sssss> for $ 22 ????? <sssss> um okay ... the horseradish sauce they gave with it was amazing though . <sssss> my husband was in love with his steak . <sssss> i had a bite , too , and it was really good . <sssss> the mac-n-cheese was very cheesy and decadent . <sssss> for dessert , we had the small chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm not sure why jane said it took a half hour to cook but either way , it was very delicious . <sssss> adding a couple glasses of wine -lrb- it took awhile for my husband to be asked if he liked a second glass of wine-after his first had been empty for at least 10 minutes -rrb- , our bill came to $ 150 . <sssss> i knew it would be expensive but did n't care because it was a gift to my husband . <sssss> i just do n't get places like this . <sssss> the service was n't better than other places -lrb- and in some instance , worse -rrb- , and the food did n't wow me . <sssss> my husband had a good point that it could be hard to do that with seafood . <sssss> i tend to agree but at that price point and the amount of food , i should have loved it . <sssss> instead , it was comparable to places half the price . <sssss> my husband will probably go back ... but without me . <sssss> meh , not interested .
HIG		i have stopped into copper star on previous occasions , during street festivals , but today was the first time i came to sit and study . <sssss> man , am i a fan of this place . <sssss> i am lucky that i live in a location where i have a multitude of options -lrb- lux , lola , hob nobs , sbux , etc -rrb- but i have to say i really liked the vibe here . <sssss> the music was n't loud , the people relatively quiet and chill , and i could actually focus on what i was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me . <sssss> i liked that while on a busy street -lrb- 7th ave -rrb- , the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on . <sssss> that added to the peace and quiet of it . <sssss> employees were nice , free wi-fi -lrb- internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop -rrb- , and i enjoyed my small , mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie -lrb- both just under $ 7 -rrb- . <sssss> i was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie -lrb- which was soooo good if i might say -rrb- . <sssss> they are open until 9pm on sundays which is pretty cool . <sssss> i have yet to use their drive through for coffee , but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to sbux . <sssss> there is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off ... you can give your dog a bath at wag-n-wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee .
MID		came here a few weeks ago for brunch because of a coupon we had from a playing card deck with restaurant discounts . <sssss> we had never been before but the menu looked delicious . <sssss> we got there pretty much when they opened on a sunday and sat at a table in their `` outside '' patio . <sssss> it is enclosed but very sunny and airy . <sssss> i ordered the stacked chicken enchiladas with a fried egg on top . <sssss> it was amazing ! <sssss> somehow i managed to eat the entire plate without any hesitation . <sssss> uh , it was so good . <sssss> the balance of sauce and cheese was just perfect and felt light despite that it was enchiladas . <sssss> we ordered the cinnamon roll for my daughter and that was fantastic , too . <sssss> she did n't enjoy it as much as we did , though , but we did n't mind finishing it for her . <sssss> the cream cheese frosting was melt in your mouth yummy . <sssss> i also had a sangria but as i recall , it was just okay . <sssss> but no matter , as we were there to try the food . <sssss> the service was great , too . <sssss> as we were leaving , it began getting packed . <sssss> clear sign that this was the place to be on a sunday morning ...
LOW		i pass this shopping center every day on my way to work and read some great things on yelp . <sssss> one of my best friends is vegetarian so i thought it would be nice for us to try it out . <sssss> we got there around 12:15 yesterday and grabbed the last remaining table . <sssss> we were greeted promptly and had our order taken within about 5 minutes after being seated . <sssss> i ordered the fried spring veggie rolls -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- that were delicious . <sssss> i kept snacking off the fried crispy pieces of the sides . <sssss> for lunch , i had ordered the curry tofu and potatoes -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- . <sssss> it came with carrots mixed in the curry sauce with rice and salad . <sssss> i equally enjoyed the salad and curry sauce over the rice . <sssss> i did n't care for the spongy tofu and would have liked more vegetables in the curry rather than just potatoes and carrots . <sssss> this lunch was just okay . <sssss> the service was horrible . <sssss> i did n't get my lunch until 12:50 p.m. . <sssss> the owner was aware of it and apologized but apologies do n't prevent me from getting back to work on time . <sssss> when we were ready to pay , it took forever for him to pick up the check . <sssss> my friend had to flag him down to get his attention . <sssss> very irritating . <sssss> timely service in a restaurant is important to me . <sssss> i would have average food and phenomenal service , as opposed to , phenomal food and terrible service . <sssss> overall , the food was decent/mediocre at times with terrible service . <sssss> it 's doubtful i would go back .
LOW		we got take-out and they were very short-handed . <sssss> it was very busy on a sat night and they only had two servers that also doubled as a hostess . <sssss> what was supposed to take 20 minutes to get our food took 35 minutes . <sssss> we also had to return the food because what was supposed to be a # 1 spicy was actually more like a # 3 . <sssss> my husband , who loves spicy , could n't even eat what was supposed to be the most mild . <sssss> when i went back -lrb- after first calling them 15 minutes before to notify them i was coming in -rrb- , i waited in the lobby for 10 minutes before being acknowledged . <sssss> the lady responded that they were busy and seemed inconvenienced by me . <sssss> i was the one who had to drive back and get my meal remade ! <sssss> i was very disappointed at the response and reluctance to fix the issue . <sssss> the remake of the beef salad was slightly less spicy but at least we could eat it . <sssss> i really enjoyed the entree but having my food wrong the first time and the bad customer service ruined the experience . <sssss> we also had the fried appetizer sampler that was just okay . <sssss> my husband goes there very frequently and loves this place . <sssss> the portions are very large and prices very reasonable . <sssss> i will go back and hopefully , this one experience was an isolated one .
LOW		do n't let my 3 stars fool you ... i am actually a pretty big fan of this place and look forward to returning . <sssss> i have been twice but the experiences were different , hence the 3 stars . <sssss> the first time i went with my husband and we were seated at one of the community tables . <sssss> they asked us if we were okay with that and it is was fine . <sssss> the more the merrier ! <sssss> i had a glass of their rose wine and ordered their salad that came with avocados , grapefruit , beets , mint , arugula , goat cheese , and a orange vinaigrette . <sssss> i asked them to leave off the grapefruit , beets , and add salami . <sssss> i thoroughly enjoyed it , wow ! <sssss> however , the second time i had it , i ordered it the exact same way -lrb- but for take-out instead -rrb- , and when i ate it , it was way too tart . <sssss> i could barely eat it which stunk because i was really looking forward to having it again . <sssss> other than that , i liked the environment . <sssss> it is really chill , i loved all of the windows which brought alot of light into the restaurant . <sssss> i will definitely go back especially since it has become a fave among my husband and friends .
LOW		we came here for lunch today and what a gorgeous day it was ! <sssss> perfect weather to sit outside in their comfy chairs . <sssss> we started with the fried calamari which is always a must when we go out to eat . <sssss> i am cuckoo for fried calamari but i got ta say i was n't diggin this one . <sssss> neither was my husband . <sssss> it was the calamari steak strips amd was chewy . <sssss> the sauce it came with was good , almost spicy aioli . <sssss> i ordered a philly roll -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- w / avocado which was okay . <sssss> i do n't know why but it tasted bland to me today ... maybe just my tastebuds . <sssss> my husband ordered a roll with halibut , spicy crab and pico de gallo on top -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- . <sssss> i thought it was okay and tasted like ceviche . <sssss> my husband liked that aspect but i am pretty traditional with my ceviche and do not want it in a sushi roll . <sssss> we also split their spicy tuna on crunchy fried rice -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- that i really liked . <sssss> i think that was because the puerto-rican in me liked crunchy rice . <sssss> weird , i know . <sssss> overall , i liked this place but ca n't say it has differentiated itself that i had to come back . <sssss> i am truly ambivalent but could easily stop in if i was shopping in the biltmore . <sssss> it has a very convenient location so you can get your sushi fix after some retail therapy .
HIG		came here last night with the family and despite zero parking in the front , the restaurant was n't too packed . <sssss> finding parking in the front is like trying to spot the loch ness monster ... it ai n't gon na happen . <sssss> but , there is complimentary valet in tne back for lgo patrons , so that is nice . <sssss> anyways , it has been a couple of years since we have been back which is surprising because this is always a fave . <sssss> the pizzas range around $ 13 - $ 14 and you can easily make two meals out of it or feed two people . <sssss> we ordered the half dozen chicken wings as an app , a white sangria for me and a beer for my husband . <sssss> my daughter had a $ 3 pb & j that consisted of 4-5 tiny pb & j `` sushi '' rolls and a rather large pile of french fries for a kids meal . <sssss> i would have liked more of the sandwich than fries but it was only $ 3 so i 'll deal with it . <sssss> i had the padre -lrb- no longer on the menu -rrb- and had it modified to be with blue cheese , prosciutto , and arugula . <sssss> it is a white pizza , so no tomato sauce . <sssss> the crust is a little crusty and chewy ... just the way i like it . <sssss> my husband ordered his favorite , the fallen angel . <sssss> our server was really attentive and very patient with our daughter . <sssss> after dinner , we walked into the grocer next door to satisfy our sweet tooth . <sssss> ooey gooey cookies were to be had -lrb- at $ 2.50 a pop ... yikes ! <sssss> -rrb- and they melted in my mouth , so yummy . <sssss> pizza , wine , and chocolate chip cookies ???? <sssss> now that is what i call the perfect meal .
LOW		my husband is the obsessive pho fan so i am constantly subjected to the pleas of vietnamese take-out . <sssss> we came here the other day for lunch and there were things i liked and did n't . <sssss> we ordered the fried spring rolls -lrb- $ 2.50 , i think -rrb- that were pretty damn good . <sssss> for lunch i ordered the bbq pork bahn-mi -lrb- sp ? <sssss> -rrb- that was $ 2.25 . <sssss> the bread was just the way i like it , soft on the inside , flaky on the outside . <sssss> it was stuffed with bbq pork , cucumber , cilantro , carrots and some other veggies . <sssss> i snagged some of the leftover sprouts from my husband 's pho and put it in my sandwich . <sssss> very good . <sssss> my beefs ? <sssss> half of the meat in my sandwich was all fat . <sssss> i am one of those people that virtually loses my appetite if i chew on something that has fat hanging off the side . <sssss> my husband , who loves the fat , was shocked at how much of the `` meat '' in my sandwich i was giving him . <sssss> i had plenty to eat of what was fast becoming a veggie sandwich but still , that was pretty annoying . <sssss> the last thing i want to do is be picking my food apart in a restaurant . <sssss> my second beef was that not once did they come back to refill our water . <sssss> that was a problem since our food was a little spicy . <sssss> that is n't to say i would n't go back . <sssss> our bill was $ 10 for lunch ... seriously pho thahn ? <sssss> that is damn reasonable and the food is decent enough for me to go back ... for take-out .
MID		a couple of us came here friday and had a good time . <sssss> i liked the off-the beaten path location and the fact that there was no cover . <sssss> they have 2-4-1 drinks 8-10pm , too . <sssss> i thought the music was good and drinks were n't too expensive . <sssss> the thing that almost ruined my time was constantly being bumped by people . <sssss> it is hard to get into the groove when you are being shoved and pushed by people who think they have an entire dance floor to themselves . <sssss> but is n't that every place , though ?
MID		i finally had a chance to try this place out when my husband decided he did n't want to do lunch and bowl at lucky . <sssss> boy , was this place packed ! <sssss> i am glad to see the locals and downtown workers embracing this place . <sssss> inside it has something like a grocery area with drinks , snacks , salads , etc. . <sssss> after ordering at one of the food or coffee counters , you can choose to sit at the counter to eat , or sit in the dining area . <sssss> service was very prompt and attentive . <sssss> i ordered a cheese pizza and triple chocolate cookie . <sssss> my husband had a pastrami and swiss sandwich that looked incredible . <sssss> my pizza was very good as well . <sssss> for all of that and a drink , it seemed pricy at $ 15 . <sssss> especially since the sandwich did n't come with chips or fries , anything . <sssss> i will still go back though as there was alot of dining options here and the food was really good .
MID		i ca n't believe i have n't reviewed this place as it is my favorite mexican restaurant in north scottsdale . <sssss> i have been here many times for either lunch , happy hour , or dinner . <sssss> every time , service is very attentive and food tasty . <sssss> they have a really good lunch menu and happy hour . <sssss> i consistently get the carnitas street taco meal with 3 tacos and rice . <sssss> their guacamole sol is another favorite made with mango , tomatoes , onions , goat cheese , pepitas . <sssss> fantastic . <sssss> and the chips , salsa , and black bean dip ? <sssss> fugeddaboutit . <sssss> i have had other dishes , some just okay , and others very good . <sssss> the items i love keep me coming back for more ...
LOW		i am so conflicted about my feelings for cherryblossom noodle . <sssss> it 's like the guy or girl you are super attracted to but they have a shitty attitude . <sssss> i wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviews that the food is great but service is inconsistent and mostly bad . <sssss> i was being generous with the 3 stars for this experience but have had higher star experiences in the past . <sssss> just not this weekend . <sssss> we went on saturday night against my husband 's better judgment and at my insistence . <sssss> sorry , babe , i take the blame for this one . <sssss> we go in and the hostess seats us -lrb- two adults and a 2 year old -rrb- . <sssss> five minutes go by and it is apparent that no one is bringing us a high chair . <sssss> my husband had to go ask for one and the hostess -lrb- who sat us -rrb- was like , oh you need a highchair ? <sssss> i suppose my daughter could sit in a regular chair but i envision her falling out , dropping food everywhere , etc. . <sssss> this hostess/server has been there forever and as a matter of fact , we have bad experiences when she has waited on us in the past . <sssss> anyways , we order our food : side of steamed rice , crispy calamari as an appetizer and for dinner , the sushi combo for me , the miso sea bass for my husband . <sssss> we also ordered a large asahi and small , hot sake . <sssss> the drinks came promptly . <sssss> i remember thinking that the calamari app was taking a little while to come out and sure enough , it comes out with my sushi combo and side of rice . <sssss> okay , whatever . <sssss> this does n't bother me too much even though the calamari looked and tasted like it had been sitting under a lamp too long . <sssss> maybe the server forgot it . <sssss> the main issue was that 10 minutes after we got that , we are still waiting on my husband 's dinner . <sssss> seriously ? <sssss> i 'll be honest in that i prefer that the whole dinner be brought out at once so that the table can eat their meals together but hey , i am flexible . <sssss> but 10-15 minutes later , i am almost done with my meal which my husband has been helping me eat since he had n't gotten his . <sssss> the miso sea bass was a special of the night so maybe the restaraunt had alot of orders for it . <sssss> that 's fine but if the kitchen is backed up , it is the server 's responsibility to let us know . <sssss> but , no , the server disappeared after dropping off the food and never came back . <sssss> he only came back after my husband walked up to the front to cancel the entree to apologize and see if we wanted dessert . <sssss> um , no , not having anything else . <sssss> about 5 minutes after that , the hostess dropped off our check and again , we waited awhile and still no server came to get the check . <sssss> so , my husband went up to the front to drop off the card . <sssss> then the manager dropped off the receipt , not the server . <sssss> terrible , terrible , service . <sssss> it is such a shame , because i love going to cherryblossom . <sssss> the sushi combo -lrb- choice of two rolls , with miso soup and salad for $ 11 -rrb- is a great deal and mostly everything i have gotten there is very good . <sssss> i also love the mixed bread basket with dinner rolls , cinnamon toast and banana bread . <sssss> but it is n't worth the crappy service . <sssss> beware , too , if you do take-out , they try to avoid giving the you the soup , salad , and bread that would normally come with your meal . <sssss> they tried telling my husband that they do n't give that for take-out . <sssss> um , unless they are discounting the take-out food -lrb- which they are not -rrb- , they should be giving everything that would normally come with the meal . <sssss> sigh , i hope this place gets their act together ...
MID		we finally came tonight after the husband has been wanting to go forever . <sssss> i have been here once before but both locations -lrb- tempe and westgate -rrb- always seem impossibly far from our cenpho home . <sssss> i do n't want to work that hard for some sushi and usually only go if in the area . <sssss> this location is in tempe marketplace so you can mix sake bombers with a little blurry retail therapy after . <sssss> i had joined their kabuki club and they frequently send me coupons for various occasions -lrb- family birthdays , anniversary , monthly specials -rrb- . <sssss> the menu is typical of most japanese spots but there is also a lot of variety . <sssss> for apps , we had the fried calamari and the garlic edamame . <sssss> i usually only have regular edamame -lrb- which they bring out complimentary -rrb- but the garlic ones were addicting ... i was literally licking the oil off my fingers and scrounging for the diced garlic in the bowl . <sssss> i only stopped when the server came by to check . <sssss> i am such a garlic junkie . <sssss> i was n't so much a fan of the thick batter on the calamari but the wasabi sauce it came with was really good . <sssss> not very spicy but with a nice kick . <sssss> i had the philly roll -lrb- $ 5.25 -rrb- and the jumbo volcano app -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- that was crab , avocado and spicy tuna baked with a little eel sauce on the top . <sssss> i would definitely have that again . <sssss> unfortunately , i could n't eat more of the jumbo volcano because i gorged myself on the apps . <sssss> we took the chocolate mousse dessert home -lrb- used our complimentary dessert coupon -rrb- . <sssss> it had fruit on the side and was filled with white chocolate . <sssss> i could have eaten that one for days and was foiled when my husband decided to eat half ... curses !! <sssss> anyways , i like the atmosphere and i think the prices are average . <sssss> it looks like they also have reverse happy hour which is always a plus in my book !
MID		while the first time i came here was a solid 3 stars , the second time was very enjoyable . <sssss> this time i ordered the cheese board and just like the last time , there were like 3 cheeses , pistachios , another kind of nut , jam , bread , etc. . <sssss> very good and plentiful . <sssss> last time , we ordered the warm mixed nuts that were really good but i could n't eat too much of it . <sssss> my husband ordered this pork dish that had hominy , and i do n't remember what else but it was freakin awesome . <sssss> i kept eating out of his skillet . <sssss> yum . <sssss> my $ 10 specialty cocktail was knock me on my ass strong but good . <sssss> i gave it to my husband after while because i would have been drunk just off the one . <sssss> i guess that is a good problem to have . <sssss> the service was top-notch . <sssss> she was just the right amount of attentive and did a great job . <sssss> the decor was bright and modern . <sssss> i really enjoyed this last experience .
LOW		i am really conflicted about lustre bar . <sssss> it is an outdoor bar located on the second floor of the hotel -lrb- where the pool is -rrb- . <sssss> it is beautiful with plenty of comfortable seating throughout . <sssss> the views are stunning . <sssss> the drinks are expensive at $ 10 a pop . <sssss> they are handcrafted cocktails -lrb- whatever that means -rrb- but i often feel they are too strong for me . <sssss> on one hand , that is probably good because at $ 10 , you wo n't need to drink many . <sssss> but i want to enjoy my drinks , so i do n't know . <sssss> you can also order food while you are up there , from the blue hound kitchen , which is cool . <sssss> keep in mind , though , that it is a limited menu . <sssss> we came for the nye party and that was a bit of a train wreck : the good : cover charge was reasonable at $ 20 . <sssss> the music was great and there was n't one particular genre , so there was something for everyone . <sssss> there was a complimentary buffet of light items . <sssss> the bad : there was n't enough heat lamps so groups of people were often huddled under them and i even saw people with blankets . <sssss> really ????? <sssss> service was horrendous and absent . <sssss> there were only 3 girls working the grounds and at point i ordered a drink from our waitress and we did n't see her for 45 minutes . <sssss> plus , i never got the drink i ordered from her . <sssss> at one point , she sniped at us that she was really busy and never came back . <sssss> i spoke with an employee about it and he handled it . <sssss> if we wanted to go to the bar instead , that was a half hour wait to get a drink . <sssss> it was awful . <sssss> i was really surprised at how little staffed this nye party was . <sssss> again , overall , i am conflicted about how i feel about lustre bar . <sssss> i think it still has some growing pains .
MID		be flexible when you come here because there might be a really long wait if you do n't have a reservation -lrb- accepted for groups 4 or more -rrb- . <sssss> the food is a bit pricey -lrb- spent $ 83 the other day for 2 adults and a child -rrb- . <sssss> despite this , i really love the new mexican cuisine and flavors , although more often than not , the food is a little too spicy for me . <sssss> my favorites are their bacon wrapped shrimp and roasted garlic plate . <sssss> fair warning that the menu is very similar to richardsons . <sssss> the other day , i ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp -lrb- 5 for $ 16 -rrb- and thought it was the dinner . <sssss> the server told me i was confusing it with richardson 's and that at rokerij , it was an app . <sssss> parking is valet , of course , which is a little annoying but standard in central phoenix .
LOW		i live in the area and i have been very interested in trying this out . <sssss> they have also certificates on restaurant.com but i did not purchase one . <sssss> i definitely have my favorite coffee shops but i am always open to adding another one to the list . <sssss> i took my daughter with me , along with some children 's books to read on a rainy , az day . <sssss> i got myself an sugar-free vanilla nonfat latte and my daughter a kids hot chocolate . <sssss> i had to repeat my latte order like 3 times to the male employee and after i got it , waited for it to cool down and took a sip , i realized they never added the syrup . <sssss> pretty annoying given how many times i had to remind the guy what i ordered as he rung me up . <sssss> the lady who made my daughter 's hot chocolate added whipped cream and chocolate syrup and did n't make it too hot , which i really appreciated . <sssss> my daughter still ended up spilling it on her white shirt . <sssss> what i was thinking ???? <sssss> a 3 year old , hot chocolate and a white shirt ?? <sssss> aahhh , the never-ending lessons of a new mom . <sssss> since i forgot to bring a snack for my daughter , i ordered a blueberry muffin for her and a chocolate chip cookie for me . <sssss> both were extremely good . <sssss> the total for the drinks and food were just under $ 9 which i think is standard . <sssss> as i looked in the display case , at the food , there was a pretty good variety . <sssss> as other reviewers mentioned , the chairs are mismatched throughout . <sssss> i found a table with a comfy chair -lrb- all of the other chairs were the standard , hard , wooden -rrb- since i planned to have my daughter in my lap as we read . <sssss> overall , i would say i enoyed my time here -lrb- besides the drink mistake -rrb- . <sssss> i wish they had some arm chairs or couches or something but maybe they will in the future . <sssss> there were alot of people here so u.b. seemed to be popular . <sssss> i 'm not sure if i would come back but maybe . <sssss> i 'm intrigued by the byob and the variety of events they have .
MID		came here last night after quickly convincing the hubby we should eat out and not stay in . <sssss> we have heard lots of good things about this place and i am pleased to say it is as good as people say . <sssss> we were seated on the patio -lrb- a good option for a rowdy 3 year old -rrb- and were promptly given water . <sssss> i ordered the tres amigos margarita special of the night -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- and liked it . <sssss> next time , i 'll have to try the rasberry -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- or pomegranate margarita -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . <sssss> hubby got the mojito and it was decent . <sssss> they were also doing free tequila tastings of tres amigos blanco , anejo and i ca n't remember the third . <sssss> i really enjoyed that as anytime i am typically having tequila , i am not exactly concerned with the tastings differences in each blend . <sssss> so , i learned something new this time . <sssss> very cool . <sssss> the menu looks really great and i look forward to trying new dishes here . <sssss> i had the salmon and spinach enchiladas that came with rice and vegetables . <sssss> the rice was moist and delicious and reminded me a lot of the rice i grew up eating with puerto-rican dishes . <sssss> the veggies were my favorites : red onions , and green and yellow squash . <sssss> the enchiladas were pretty good but i would probably not order them again . <sssss> i am more of a traditional enchilada type of girl and as much as i love salmon , i guess i do n't prefer it in my enchiladas . <sssss> but that is no fault to padres as the dish was very good . <sssss> my husband ordered their steak and unfortunately , his medium rare steak came out well done . <sssss> they fixed it but hubby was very annoyed that i was pretty much finished with my plate when his remake came out . <sssss> the server was great even though he forgot my daughter 's drink and ordered her a cheese quesadilla appetizer and not the kids cheese quesadilla . <sssss> but other than that , he consistently checked on us , was knowledgeable and enthusiastic on the menu and told us we should come back for salsa nights . <sssss> on friday and sat nights , they do salsa dancing and bring in a band . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go for that with some girlfriends . <sssss> fri it is 8:30 -11:30 pm and sat it is 8-11pm .
MID		i recently took my daughter here for dinner and we had a really nice meal . <sssss> as expected , it was packed on a friday night , but we did n't wait long for a table . <sssss> the kids meals are free and my daughter had the cheese pizza with a side salad . <sssss> i ordered the pork chile verde , goat cheese app , and a side of polenta . <sssss> i also had 2 cocktails and since it was happy hour , everything was relatively inexpensive . <sssss> before we left , i ordered the pork belly risotto for my husband and everything came out to $ 45 . <sssss> very reasonable . <sssss> service was attentive , too , and humored my daughter with all of her 6 yr old ramblings and questions . <sssss> we really enjoyed ourselves !
LOW		came here for nye dinner and i was relieved there was n't a prixe fix menu like every other restaurant in downtown phoenix . <sssss> this was my first time here and i was pretty impressed with the size and decor . <sssss> for some reason i was expecting something more casual but it was very nicely decorated and upscale . <sssss> our server was very attentive and friendly even with the place being packed . <sssss> i ordered a martini and a margherita pizza . <sssss> my drink was good but i was very disappointed in the pizza . <sssss> the crust and dough were very limp and cheese too thick . <sssss> when i took a bite , almost all of the cheese on the slice tried to come with it because it was so thick . <sssss> i had some of my husband 's pizza which was only slightly better . <sssss> the dough was just too limp and not what i would expect from this place . <sssss> maybe little caesers . <sssss> i want to go back though and give it another shot ...
MID		i just love farmer 's markets and being able to try lots of different local things . <sssss> today , we stopped by on a yelp shops local crawl and i immediately diverted to several stands . <sssss> various items i scooped up today included 2 large soft pretzels , cheese curds , avocado and garlic oil , and a spicy filipino marinade at lil rosie 's . <sssss> very nice farmer 's market .
LOW		we decided to eat here while at the moon festival sat night . <sssss> i was a little embarrassed that we had a stroller with us but they did n't bat an eye . <sssss> they showed us where to put it and we were good to go . <sssss> my husband and i each had a tsing tao -lrb- i 'm sure i mispelled that -rrb- , and split an order of crab rangoon , sweet and sour chicken and rice noodles with beef . <sssss> everything was decent although not enough to distinguish itself from other chinese restaurants . <sssss> service was great and prices were extremely reasonable . <sssss> my fave was the rice noodles with beef because it had lots of onions , sprouts and other veggies in it . <sssss> a little salty for my liking but i liked it nonetheless . <sssss> i am indifferent if i were to go back . <sssss> apparently you can find certificates on restaurant.com which is cool , too . <sssss> they also bring you soft , almond cookies with the bill which is always a nice treat !
LOW		i used to love this place but now we go more out of habit . <sssss> we got take-out there the other night for a light meal and managed to spend $ 30 on a regular spicy tuna roll , a specialty roll and side of steamed rice . <sssss> $ 30 seriously ? <sssss> and the specialty roll was only 6 pieces which was disappointing given the cost . <sssss> looks like hana is starting to cut back with prices staying steady or increasing . <sssss> a sign in the front alerts patrons who want to split checks that there will be a $ 1.50 charge on each bill `` given the recent economy . '' <sssss> i find that pretty unbelievable . <sssss> anyways , the food is generally pretty good . <sssss> one of my favorites is their hana salad although i was pretty disappointed when they began layering the bottom of the salad with iceberg lettuce instead of the usual mix . <sssss> again with the cut-backs . <sssss> do n't get me wrong . <sssss> i like hana alot but i think they are becoming overpriced for food that is good but in an average way comparable to other asian spots .
HIG		i 'll admit , it has been many years since i have had an actual meal here . <sssss> the only reason i come is for the to die for cheesecake . <sssss> it used to be that i would typically get the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake , which by the way , is sinful . <sssss> well , i guess they all are . <sssss> it has an oreo crust , chocolate chips throughout and on the top , and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side . <sssss> then they introduced the red velvet cake cheesecake and i 'm like , seriously , cheesecake factory ? <sssss> it has a moist , red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake . <sssss> it also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting . <sssss> i came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token -lrb- as my husband puts it , yeah right ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i got the cookie dough slice and then i noticed the red velvet which i thought was just a limited time . <sssss> so what was an indecisive girl to do but get both slices . <sssss> $ 16 later -lrb- yikes ! <sssss> -rrb- but i am the happiest girl in the world .
MID		the husband took me here on date night , last night , as he keeps saying it is one of his favorite bars downtown . <sssss> he kept raving about how nice the decor was inside , and i thought , `` great , another potentially pretentious upscale bar . '' <sssss> i will say it can give off that vibe but i thought the bar was really nice . <sssss> it is on the corner of adams and 1st st , i think , so if you are sitting at the tables by the windows , there is plenty of people watching to be seen . <sssss> we sat at the bar and it was busy when we got there around 10:30 pm . <sssss> it quickly died out , though . <sssss> the music was really good with alot of 80 's r & b / pop but with beats mixed to it . <sssss> i had a malibu and cranberry , hubby had 2 vodka tonics -lrb- smirnoff -rrb- , and we split one of their snack plates since we already had dinner . <sssss> in the middle of the bar is one of those deli slicers with prosciutto and a block of parmesan next to it . <sssss> the snack plate consisted of some bread , salami , prosciutto , two kinds of olives , roasted pistachios , and slices of parmesan . <sssss> my kind of snack !! <sssss> to my shock , our bill was only $ 24 -lrb- with tax -rrb- . <sssss> my drink was $ 7 , the vodka tonics were $ 5 each and the snack plate was $ 5 . <sssss> i was very surprised at how reasonable those prices were . <sssss> i suppose given the decor , i was expecting to be charged more so it was a good surprise . <sssss> especially for that snack plate where i have paid close to $ 10 for something similar . <sssss> i ca n't wait to return !
