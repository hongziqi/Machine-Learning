?		we love mojo ! <sssss> its not as evil of a treat and the flavors are so yummy ! <sssss> a minor downfall is how the mix-ins are sometimes hard to reach and i 've seen a girl literally put her whole head into the bar and that grossed me out with the idea others have done the same ... aka - possible human debris and hair in my yogurt !
?		this is a casual spot to eat with friends before going out into old town . <sssss> servers are hit or miss but just this last visit our server was very flexible with the menu and willing to change/add things to make us happy . <sssss> they recently added sushi to the menu which was odd to my friends since the place is a chinese restaurant . <sssss> i really did n't care and just ordered 2 rolls which were pretty good ! <sssss> the spicy tuna was `` meh '' and the crouching dragon roll was deelish ! <sssss> love edamame and the server suggested some sauce but gave it on the side `` in case '' i did n't like it - but it was really good , so glad she offered it ! <sssss> the half portions are very large so no need to order the whole size unless your sharing . <sssss> they do n't have sapporo light which kinda sucks because of the extra calories . <sssss> great open bar and cool happy hour spot .
?		best steak in town hands down ! <sssss> great crowd , live music , professional servers , wonderful menu . <sssss> the lobster mashed potatoes are a must try on the menu !! <sssss> i had one martini and could n't finish the second because the first one did enough damage : -rrb- housemade whipped cream with dessert literally made me dance in my chair . <sssss> fantastic , fun place to go on a date ~ !!
?		we went for lunch and i made the mistake of ordered the shrimp tacos and a smithwicks because i was craving them . <sssss> the fiance -lrb- yes , we 're engaged ! <sssss> -rrb- ok , so he ordered a burger and kiltlifter . <sssss> the food came and my tacos were whack -lrb- duh - i should have known better ! <sssss> -rrb- and travis 's burger was bomb . <sssss> it had a fat onion ring in it and thick cut bacon . <sssss> i ate more of his than mine . <sssss> besides all that , our server was crappy . <sssss> she never came around to ask if we wanted another round of brews ... lame . <sssss> as a pub - they should be bringing barrels to us . <sssss> the bill was $ 50.00 . <sssss> the end .
?		from beginning to the end , durants was flawless . <sssss> no windows in the place , and red booths fill the room . <sssss> a large inviting bar , and old rat pack feel from the place . <sssss> if i could afford to dine here often i would be one fat and happy girl .
?		my wife really wanted to come here . <sssss> i used to think this was the best in town , but things have changed . <sssss> it seems like every time i walk away from here my thoughts are on `` i just paid $ ... for that ! '' <sssss> it seems like prices went up and quality went down when they opened at the biltmore . <sssss> i guess they have to cover that rent with higher prices .
?		just wonderful ! <sssss> i love the coffee here . <sssss> the atmosphere is war and friendly . <sssss> a lot of friendly people hanging out .
?		these 4 stars are all based on expectations . <sssss> what do you expect when you go to greasewood flats ? <sssss> what are your expectations when you go to a bar that has mostly outdoor seating ; picnic tables ; open fire pits ; horseshoe pitches ; donkeys ; roosters ; one man band ; limited food menu ; serves only beer and sodas ; and is filled with bikers , cowboys and lesser so tourists . <sssss> this is everything that you expect from greasewood flats . <sssss> the atmosphere is so relaxed that i think you would be hard pressed to find a more caasual environment . <sssss> everyone is just having a good time hanging out with friends . <sssss> the green chile and bacon cheeseburger is a great idea , but the only way they cook the burgers is to medium . <sssss> medium is overcooked in my book and the medium that i got was actually well done . <sssss> again , it 's about expectations . <sssss> i came here to hang out with friends and family and enjoy the day .
?		the food & beverages at moto are awesome . <sssss> the service needs a little help , as they do n't always check on you to see if you need another beer or a water refill . <sssss> they might just need more staff . <sssss> i award 4 stars because i know i will be back for the beer and food . <sssss> awesome selection of craft brews on tap , only $ 3/glass during happy hour -lrb- 3pm - 6:15 pm -rrb- . <sssss> cheap appetizers during happy hour too . <sssss> win ! <sssss> numerous veggie choices -lrb- that are actually good -rrb- . <sssss> the wonton nachos minus meat were awesome . <sssss> the tofu yakisoba was awesome . <sssss> the veggie rolls were awesome . <sssss> i wish this place was closer to my house .
?		what a breath of fresh fresh air . <sssss> the owner of this restaurant actually took my constructive criticism and made some very positive changes based on them . <sssss> how awesome is that ? <sssss> regarding the rice , apparently the staff who previously told me that they used chicken stock was misinformed . <sssss> the owner showed me the seasoning they use and it is all veggie ! <sssss> they 're also now carrying a vegan lentil soup daily and it 's delicious ! <sssss> the pitas contain no dairy , which is awesome . <sssss> this place makes some great veggie food and the owner is very friendly and responsive to customer needs . <sssss> definitely recommend that you check this place out !
?		i like the comparison to lady & the tramp that nathan s. made in his review . <sssss> this place totally reminds me of that scene too with the red & white checkered table cloths . <sssss> the service at anzio 's is usually very good . <sssss> the salads are very good . <sssss> the bread is good . <sssss> the pizza and the other dishes are just ok . <sssss> the beer selection is lacking , no good micro-brews -lrb- get some sierra nevada , new belgium beers or at least some four peaks , would ya ? <sssss> -rrb- and that 's all i 've got to say about that
?		i 've always wondered what a breakfast pizza would be like and i finally found out at my visit to scramble . <sssss> i ordered up the garlic spinach , thyme & mushroom brizza -lrb- which also comes with some type of cheese , possibly provolone -rrb- . <sssss> this thing was delish ! <sssss> my girl ordered up the ham & cheddar brizza , but she liked mine even more and proceeded to steal one of my slices . <sssss> scramble also scores extra points with me for having loose-leaf teas . <sssss> i got a cup of the gun-powder green tea mint , which was very good . <sssss> we were bummed that the hashbrowns were pre-made with bacon inside , as it made them no option for vegetarians like me . <sssss> we sat outside at their very slick & shaded outdoor patio and dining area . <sssss> cmon down , ya got ta try a breakfast pizza !
?		seeing the word `` hippies '' in the restaurant name had me stoked , as them tree-huggin hippie types got to have some vegetarian food , right ? <sssss> yep . <sssss> i walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options , the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites . <sssss> score ! <sssss> or so i thought ... upon receiving the large , heavily stuffed burrito , i bit in with high hopes . <sssss> those hopes quickly dissipated as i found that the innards of the burrito were primarly cold . <sssss> the cactus pieces were cold , the cheese was n't melted at all . <sssss> the only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans , which were n't even hot , they were luke warm . <sssss> sorry guys , but a cold burrito is n't going to cut it . <sssss> make that cactus , beans and rice hot in your burritos if you want some customers . <sssss> melt the friggin cheese in there , do n't leave it ice cold .
?		i 'm giving castles n coasters 4 stars for their mini-golf . <sssss> four separate courses , plenty of creative greens & hazards , lots of decorations , statues , structures , fountains , everything that makes up a good miniature golf course . <sssss> oh , and did i mention they have 4 different courses ? <sssss> once your done with some tiny golf , cool off with some video games , pinball or skeeball inside their gaming area . <sssss> the rides do n't interest me , so this rating & review ignores their `` amusement park '' aspect completely .
?		alright loving hut , let 's face the facts , i love you and you love me . <sssss> your `` strategery '' of using `` love '' in your establishment name has paid off , as you have enamored me with your delicious , 100 % vegan food as well as your kind & friendly staff . <sssss> i eat here all the time . <sssss> we even get their food for parties . <sssss> vegetarians , vegans & omnivores alike will find something to enjoy at loving hut . <sssss> in particular , i can wholeheartedly recommend the `` spicy cha cha '' , a unique faux breaded shrimp dish that i have seen no where else , made with yam protein . <sssss> yes , it 's delicious & amazing . <sssss> keep on rockin on , north phoenix loving hut .
?		great food , great portions , great prices .
?		had a great happy hour there this week . <sssss> great food and drinks-highly recommend the moscow mule .
?		love the view and good food . <sssss> had the lobster carbonara as my meal with the king pao green beans . <sssss> they are both listed as sides , but make a surprisingly great pairing . <sssss> enjoy !
?		not too impressed with the food , luckily we were with great friends so we had a fun time .
?		great food and service . <sssss> only 4stars cause of outside patio furniture was horrible and prices .
?		mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm1
?		i was not impressed with the sauce . <sssss> and the beef seemed real greasy . <sssss> im use to sliced beef instead of shredded . <sssss> corn bread fell apart into a million crumbs when i took it out of the wrapper . <sssss> i just wasnt impressed at all . <sssss> the people were friendly and was a clean facility .
?		my very first try of ethiopian . <sssss> went at lunch hour . <sssss> selected menu items 3 , 4 , 5 . <sssss> 1 meat and 2 vegetarian . <sssss> the food came out within a minute or 2 - so they must have some buffet line inside . <sssss> the food kind of tastes like a underspiced indian food . <sssss> i almost wish the sauce was with goat or lamb . <sssss> the service was non-existant after the food trough drop off , so we just walked up and paid . <sssss> i guess i did n't find ethiopian food that remarkable - sorry ...
?		a trendy looking restaurant and bar . <sssss> we ordered the ribs and grits , seafood chowda , pineapple-upside down cake , roasted cauliflower . <sssss> also enjoyed a few cocktails . <sssss> everything was really good - really like the blue cheese grits . <sssss> i recommend !!!
?		wanted to go to a gastropub , and ended up here . <sssss> this is a really nice place inside . <sssss> comfortable seating of all types . <sssss> a big bar . <sssss> the kitchen is wide open for all to see . <sssss> the restrooms are clean and nice , too . <sssss> we ordered ; triple fried duck fries -lrb- excellent fries -rrb- , chicken liver mousse -lrb- this was absolutely excellent - could not stop eating -rrb- , bone marrow -lrb- very good flavor -rrb- , candied pork belly -lrb- quite good -rrb- . <sssss> thoruoughly enjoyed my experience here . <sssss> the service was excellent . <sssss> also tried 3 of their tasy signature drinks ; maple glazed old fashioned , frozen ` rita , and another . <sssss> a great place to dine !
?		i have been here a few times and this most recent visit was one of the last of the season : -lrb- i love walking around here , usually the entire lot is filled up but this time around there were only a few vendors . <sssss> we managed to walk away with some amazing fresh cheese from gina 's homeade : http://www.ginashomemade.com/ . <sssss> the cheese we had was fresh and soft as a spread and had some onions and chives in it . <sssss> when i say fresh , the guy said that they had just made it the day before . <sssss> oh and he had fresh cured bacon that was cured the day before as well . <sssss> amazing . <sssss> we also bought some chocolates from a vendor again , useless me ca n't remember the name but it was awesome and he was clearly passionate about his chocolates . <sssss> he explained where he got different cocoa from and the differences in the tastes because of the region . <sssss> so cool . <sssss> we sampled some other stuff too and of course it was all great . <sssss> i wish they did n't shut down for the summer , but who can blame them . <sssss> ca n't wait til they are back up and running !
?		this was out first time bringing out first dog as a couple to a park . <sssss> we were so nervous ! <sssss> milly is a bolted and has n't quite learned her manners/cues yet so its really intimidating to bring a dog like that in a public area . <sssss> there are double doors and high fences so this was clearly thought through . <sssss> milly had a great time ! <sssss> they provide poo bags which is nice but make sure you watch your step - not all puppy parents care to pick up their poo . <sssss> they have plenty of balls and toys to play with as well as some watering spots which was fun . <sssss> i ca n't wait to bring her back here to get rid of her energy !
?		management handled my problem the way all management should handle any restaurant problem . <sssss> they were quick to respond and it was very clear they want everyone to be happy . <sssss> thank you for redeeming yourself on this and i appreciate the extra time you took to email me a few times and learn what happened . <sssss> other pita jungles and all restaurants should take note on handling these kinds of situations . <sssss> thank you !
?		convenient - close to the house and easy . <sssss> this was my first time here and it was eh . <sssss> i got the beef and broccoli - i know , not a traditional thai dish by any means , but i was in the mood . <sssss> the sauce was good and the broccoli was cooked well but the meat was too thin , dry , bland but managed to taste weird . <sssss> i ate everything but the meat and was still full so not a total loss . <sssss> my boyfriend got the pad thai and it was also only ok . <sssss> i do n't think i would return here , but i also do n't want to judge it on a one time trip .
?		this is our go to delivery pizza . <sssss> they always say it will take 45 minutes , but they are here in 30 and sometimes under . <sssss> we live very close but other places have n't delivered as fast as these guys . <sssss> we usually end up ordering on sundays when we are to lazy to cook and we always order the same thing . <sssss> they are nothing but consistent and good from the pizza to the wings . <sssss> i have had other pizza around the valley but none this good ... just genuinely good pizza and service -lrb- and ranch dressing ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		although some of the guys seemed a bit confused around lunch time , the service was great and quick . <sssss> this was my first time eating here and its great pizza with great ranch dressing . <sssss> we had pepperoni and cheese slices with a salad . <sssss> the salad was big enough to share so that was nice . <sssss> i would definitely order from here and get delivery or just go and eat here again . <sssss> they had some renovations going on during our trip there but it was still really clean and nice inside .
?		i love everything about this place and i eat at a pita jungle at least once a week . <sssss> here 's why i love this place ... first , the waitresses are all super cool and edgie . <sssss> if you 're a semi-goth chick with a couple of tattoos , midrif , belly button ring , and hot body , you ought to apply to pita jungle and go get me some hummus . <sssss> second , the hummus . <sssss> i get a hummus plate with 1/3 hummus , 1/3 babaganoosh , and 1/3 tadzhiki -lrb- my spelling stinks i 'm sure -rrb- . <sssss> this is a great appetizer and is fun to share . <sssss> third , the prices . <sssss> this place is a great bargain . <sssss> fourth the portions ... they 're huge ! <sssss> fifth , the `` garden veggie wrap '' . <sssss> okay i love meat . <sssss> but occasionally my body tells me i need some veggies . <sssss> when this occurs i go to pita jungle and order this beast . <sssss> it 's huge , it 's tasty and it 's loaded with veggies . <sssss> i figure i get a week 's worth of veggies in one sitting with this baby . <sssss> sixth , everything else . <sssss> i love everything on the menu ... the smoothies , the lavosh schwarma wrap , the pizza 's , the wine list , and the seafood provencal is an amazing portion of seafood for 10 bucks . <sssss> in closing please excuse my spelling . <sssss> i ran spell check and apparently my spelling here is so bad even spell check ca n't help me .
?		happy to stumble upon this place while looking for a munch on our way to a concert at the marquee theater . <sssss> really , really good carne asada . <sssss> we had burritos , and the trio chip platter which includes chips , salsa and guacamole . <sssss> the guac and the carne were authentic with just the right amount of kick . <sssss> you know you 're at an authentic mexican joint when they garnish your meal with a radish chunk . <sssss> the price was fine , so i 'm not sure about all the griping about being pricey . <sssss> the quality of meat makes up for being charged 50 cents more . <sssss> this place is a gem . <sssss> they have a limited menu , but what they do do is spot on delicious . <sssss> tasty to the mex , i mean max .
?		i love this place . <sssss> i 'm so glad i finally stopped in . <sssss> huge seating area . <sssss> great prices . <sssss> huge portions . <sssss> i got a gyro with feta and it was darn good . <sssss> was it the best gyro in town ? <sssss> no . <sssss> but it was very respectable . <sssss> the pita bread had a nice chewy crustiness to it . <sssss> the meat was seasoned and moist , and the toppings of tomato , onions , yogurt sauce -lrb- tetziki sp -rrb- and feta were very generous . <sssss> i love a good messy sandwich and this fit the bill . <sssss> it came was large side of fries . <sssss> a nice meal for 7 bucks . <sssss> the rest of the food all looked tasty and well-portioned . <sssss> i 'm going back for burger , then a salad , then a chicken sandwich and then a sub .
?		three things on the menu . <sssss> pizza , calzones and salads . <sssss> that 's it . <sssss> all done very well , in a great atmosphere with attentive service . <sssss> the pizza menu has no suggestions , just a list of toppings , accordingly , you have ... no meat lovers pizza . <sssss> got ta make your own . <sssss> no margharitta pizza . <sssss> you select it . <sssss> no bbq chicken pizza . <sssss> figure it out and order it . <sssss> no veggie pizza . <sssss> pick 'em yourself . <sssss> of course , the list of toppings is ample , and you can design anything you want . <sssss> we ordered a small pie with garlic and pepperoni . <sssss> also had a small salad . <sssss> -lrb- fyi the salad menu does not require that you pick your own ingredients . <sssss> -rrb- they were having some oven temperature problems , but the staff was helpful and the manager took care of the issue . <sssss> bring the whole family .
?		-lrb- keep in mind there are few choices for hawaiian style fast food in az so this might influence my review -rrb- . <sssss> i love going here when i have a craving for hawaiian food . <sssss> i usually order the bbq mix plater composed of beef , chicken and short ribs . <sssss> i also love their macaroni salad . <sssss> the portions here are quite large ; i usally eat half the plate and save the rest for later . <sssss> the people at this location are very friendly and the food is prepared quickly . <sssss> i would recommend this place if you are tired of eating at the burger/mexican chains around phoenix .
?		nice place to try a different kinda of sandwich if you 're tired of chains like subway . <sssss> i love their housemade mozzarella , local tomato & basil : food was fresh and the bread was excellent . <sssss> i also tried the tuna with red onion , gaeta olives , lemon & arugula and that was nice as well . <sssss> service/seating was really quick -lrb- went on a saturday for lunch -rrb- . <sssss> only complaint is the parking , had to park on the street a couple blocks down because their lot was packed .
?		i 've been to buffalo wild wings before , but my first visit at this location was during ufc 117 . <sssss> if you come here to watch fighting events like ufc i would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside . <sssss> i arrived an hour before the ppv portion of the fight started and did n't get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside . <sssss> i ordered 12 regular wings and i was very underwhelmed . <sssss> i felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average . <sssss> the main reason why i went here was that they were n't charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight . <sssss> also , the atmosphere for a ufc fight was really good compared to the other bww i went to in tucson . <sssss> if you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event , you should come to bww . <sssss> but your food expectations should be lowered a lot .
?		i would go there much more if i was closer . <sssss> always find very interesting items . <sssss> like it when they sample the food . <sssss> i got hooked with the lasagna and have been buying it ever since . <sssss> this store as with other trader joes can get super busy later in the evening .
?		i have tried a couple other vietnamese food restaurants and think tea lite has the freshest ingredients and best overall flavor . <sssss> # 1 or # 3 depending if i want more beef or spring rolls . <sssss> the pork ball sandwich is also tasty . <sssss> the soups are great when it is cooler . <sssss> pasadena on them in summer . <sssss> i usually go there for lunch . <sssss> it can get crowded at 12pm so you may want to try earlier or a little later .
?		easy to find what you are looking for . <sssss> parking lot is big . <sssss> it is nice and clean . <sssss> fyi . <sssss> i do n't shop here for the gas .
?		it would get 5 stars if sandbar patrons did not take all the parking spots . <sssss> that is very annoying !! <sssss> last night i could not find a place to park , so i went to albertsons to purchase my alcohol . <sssss> take notice total wine , you are losing customers !
?		one word ... chicken tikka masala ! <sssss> ok ... it 's one word if you say it like i do . <sssss> i like to say it fast so i can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating part . <sssss> this place is awesome . <sssss> i ordered samosas , garlic naan , mixed grill -lrb- tandoori oven cooked variety of meats -rrb- and chickentikkamasala * giggle * . <sssss> the mixed grill was good , but the naan and the masala was the highlight . <sssss> i had to slap the hubby 's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing ... ok ... by ` slap ' i mean i may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork , pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance ... we 're so playful . <sssss> disclaimer : * no hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before , during , or after the consumption of the delicious items procured from i.d.p. . <sssss> the improvised narrative describing the dinner-eating portion is fictional ... the tastiness of the items we ordered is factual .
?		this place is fantastic ! <sssss> customer service was great and the prices are very reasonable . <sssss> we kinda wandered our way into the chinese cultural center on a lazy sunday afternoon , i needed to pick up a couple of things from the market , and have been craving some genuinely delicious chinese food -lrb- i was experiencing bad nerves exacerbated by systemic and repeated bouts of disappointment with my takeout and delivery options -rrb- ... anywho ... we got allllllll sorts of kerfluffled and twitterpated when we saw they had a dim sum section on the menu ... not very many dim sum options , but all of them sounded pretty good to me -lrb- plus it was the first time i actually saw a dim sum menu , usually i just see folks wandering around with carts of unknown treasures and delights ... no carts on the day we went there though -rrb- . <sssss> the menu itself is gigantic , huge , colossal -lrb- ok , not in a cheesecake factory way , but definitely more than you 'll find at a hole-in-the-wall quick order-by-numbers place -lrb- ie # 1 w / chicken and # 27 w / shrimp -rrb- -rrb- ... and is broken down into americanized and non . <sssss> i love that . <sssss> it gives me an opportunity to get something that i 'm familiar with and try some more risque items that i ca n't get from panda express . <sssss> ; -rrb- so here 's the dish : *** wonton in spicy & sour sauce -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - heavenly **** dumpling in chili sauce -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - even better than the wontons ** dan dan noodle -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - it was ok , but the other two were way better ***** sauteed green bean - phenomenal and second only to ... ***** yuxiang eggplant -lrb- this was so good that if someone told me i had to eat this eggplant and those green beans every day for the rest of my life , i would thank them ... and maybe offer my eternal gratitude -rrb- . <sssss> all of that came to about $ 30 , we were stuffed and had leftovers for my lunch the next day . <sssss> also , i went to their website -lrb- just now -rrb- and it looks like you can order takeout -lrb- phoenix -rrb- or takeout and delivery -lrb- chandler -rrb- from them online . <sssss> solid !!!
?		o. m. f ` ing . <sssss> gee ! <sssss> it was so good , and delivery was so fast ... like faster than freaky fast ... it was like roadrunner fast ... or speedy gonzales ` andale andale arriba arriba yee haw yee haw ' rapido , or like ` chip , i 'm gon na come at you like a spider monkey ! ' <sssss> fast ... and just as quickly , it was gone . <sssss> to be honest , i do n't even think the italian beef sandwich , drenched and then smothered in sweet and hot peppers with provolone cheese , even knew what hit it . <sssss> one moment , it 's all safe , warm & cozy in its pot , skillet , oven ... wherever italian beef comes from , then bam ! <sssss> it 's whisked off on a whirlwind adventure , delivered and not even 10 minutes later swimming in tummy acid . <sssss> happy tummy acid . <sssss> to be frank -lrb- because i guess i already used ` to be honest ' -rrb- , i have enjoyed other tamales w / chili and cheese a * skosh * better -lrb- not bad , but not the best ever -rrb- , but the italian beef sandwich today has me hooked -lrb- plus they have pink lemonade and deliver , and that always makes working tygers happy -rrb- . <sssss> lots of delicious sounding stuff on the menu , i 'm looking forward to trying the chicago dog and the buffalo bleu fries . <sssss> one note to the delivery driver/to-go order specialists/management : when delivering a giant mess of a sandwich , make sure to also include napkins , fork and knife . <sssss> maybe even some of those moist towelettes they give to bbq revelers . <sssss> while clinton and lewinski may think it 's cute to have a little mess on a dress , the people i work with do not appreciate it . <sssss> * * just kidding , no dresses were harmed during the scarfing down of this meal . <sssss> *
?		it 's ok , and the prices are ok . <sssss> but the only things that i have consistently liked here are the irish car bombs , the giant pretzels -lrb- ... mmmm sodiyummy ... -lrb- sodium + yummy ... you know ? <sssss> -rrb- and beer-cheesy ! <sssss> -rrb- and the servers are more-or-less on the ball 100 % of the time . <sssss> anywho , i know they 've been going through a couple of staffing issues with their cook -lrb- s -rrb- so i will refrain from being too bummed out on the food ... plus it was a monday night so i 'll give 'em the benefit of the doubt . <sssss> we ordered the foley 's sampler , the chicken fingers were awesome , the wings were really decent too , but i could 've done without any of the rest of it . <sssss> next time i 'll see about ordering some traditional irish fare and make a real assessment . <sssss> yes , i 'll be back . <sssss> but i 'm not making any other excuses for y ' all , dammit .
?		i know artists * in general * totally hate when you compare their new stuff to their old stuff ... but here goes ! <sssss> i absolutely loved sens. . <sssss> . <sssss> and fate . <sssss> sochu house is n't quite there for me . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , the food was creative and delicious . <sssss> the drink menu may still need a little work . <sssss> and drinks are kinda the most important part of the meal , right ? <sssss> we had the chicken lollipops , sugar cane pork , sweet soya , pad thai and the spring rolls . <sssss> nothing on the drink menu really grabbed me so we had the bartenderess mix up a couple of surprises . <sssss> it was ... ok . <sssss> not fabulous , just ok . <sssss> i agree with the other reviews that say the location at the strip mall is a little bizarre . <sssss> i enjoy finding strip mall dining treasures , but i can honestly say that i never would 've thought about putting sochu house there . <sssss> i love the music and they did a great job with decorating the space though . <sssss> get the sugar cane pork , do n't forget to chew on the sugar cane for a little extra flavor .
?		okay ... so i 've read thru some of the reviews . <sssss> i remember when it used to be paco paco -lrb- also a fun-spot -rrb- , but that was in my past-life experience , and it bears not-a-lot of resemblance to the place it used to be . <sssss> and i 'm not complaining . <sssss> yes , the music is pretty frickin badass -lrb- we went on saturday but i do n't believe it was an obscura night -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm a punk rock girl -lrb- do n't let the current wave of office-inspired playwear fool you -rrb- and i enjoyed their ecclectic music mix of 80 's subversive occasionally poppy songs ... the drinks are good and well - -lrb- well meaning decent , not well meaning bottom-shelf bar -rrb- - priced . <sssss> it 's nicely dark and murky ... unless you sit by the door , which is what we did at first ... hey ! <sssss> we were trying to pace ourselves -lrb- that did n't really work , i think i sucked back 4 jack and cokes in 30 minutes , do n't judge me , i had a rough day ! <sssss> -rrb- 4 drinks ... under $ 25 . <sssss> you have won my loyalty . <sssss> -lrb- so what , i 'm easy -rrb- so during that first 30 minutes , i was my counter-characteristically -lrb- read : sober -rrb- delightfully demure and polite self ... by minute 45 i was back to normal and having a grand old time , making friends , making enemies , trying to make friends out of aforementioned enemies ... you know , whatever . <sssss> anyone who said that alcohol is n't the answer was not asking the same questions i asked that night . <sssss> and i absolutely love the conglomeration of off-beat characters that came through the door . <sssss> this dive bar kicks patooty . <sssss> i like it . <sssss> i like it alot .
?		scrumptious ! <sssss> after going with my friend to see ` get him to the greek ' -lrb- it was a theme day ! <sssss> -rrb- we went to cyprus grill for lunch . <sssss> i ordered the spartan sandwich -lrb- which is grilled chicken and gyro meat -lrb- presumably lamb , but possibly cow , lol -rrb- on a pita and a side of greek fries -lrb- which are their fries with crumbled feta and maybe a lemon type sauce -rrb- ... well , whatever is on those fries , it should be illegal ! <sssss> i rarely enjoy fries and i ate every single last one on my plate ! <sssss> the portions are big and i will probably be eating my pita sandwich for another two days . <sssss> i highly recommend this place , it 's super tasty ! <sssss> -lrb- and the service was uber-fast ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		yummmmmmmy !!! <sssss> we went here for lunch today and ordered the edamame -lrb- appetizer -rrb- , firecracker chicken and broccoli w / jasmine rice and the gluten-free jeweled beef . <sssss> everything was fantastic and our server , alicea , was awesome . <sssss> the service was fast , friendly and we had a great time . <sssss> -lrb- also , they have happy hour from like 11am to 6pm ! <sssss> -rrb- too bad we ca n't take advantage of that extended happy hour , but some day * shaking my fist at ` the man ' * midday drinking will become an acceptable work phenomenon again . <sssss> * giggle *
?		midweek ... do n't wan na cook ... do n't wan na drive ... who delivers ?? <sssss> corleone 's !! <sssss> the delivery person was a sweetheart which is the equivalent of having a pleasant waiter/waitress to start your meal experience . <sssss> it sets the mood and expectations and well ... it was yummy ! <sssss> if you order the cheese fries , make sure you eat those first since cheez wiz has a limited time frame for being fresh and hot . <sssss> once it chills , you end up with ... well ... goop . <sssss> i love their cheesesteak sandwiches , this time the fries were a little overdone but still not too bad . <sssss> for a $ 20 we ordered a couple of cheesesteak sandwiches and split a cheese fry , just enough food and it does n't break the bank . <sssss> not bad for delivery !
?		ever since my bf recently discovered frozen yogurt -lrb- yeah , he 's a little slow to jump on the bandwagon -rrb- , we 've been trying different yogurt places around town . <sssss> i usually get dragged to a yogurt dessert after eating ridiculously large meals , so thank goodness it 's lower in fat ! <sssss> i 'm 5 ' 6 '' and trying to keep up with a 6 ' 2 '' man 's metabolism here . <sssss> yogurtland has been our favorite . <sssss> they have an excellent selection with a wide variety of flavors and toppings . <sssss> we tried a bunch of flavors and both ended up doing a strawberry/cheesecake mix with strawberries , blueberries , and walnuts on top . <sssss> we also added a few of their little cheese cake bites . <sssss> their yogurt 's taste and texture is perfect . <sssss> when the cashier rang us up , we thought she had only totalled one of our yogurts by accident ... could it be only $ 6 for two pretty fully loaded cups of yogurt ?? <sssss> normally , one yogurt runs us $ 5-6 . <sssss> not only is it good , it 's cheap too ?! <sssss> that gets my stamp of approval .
?		pane bianco is a great place to take out of towners . <sssss> my sister was visiting from chilly boston last weekend , so i was determined keep her outdoors in this beautiful weather as much as possible . <sssss> after roaming the downtown phoenix farmer 's market , we enjoyed lunch at pane bianco . <sssss> pb is sandwiched between a cafe -lrb- with amazing-looking baked goods -rrb- and a bike shop . <sssss> the seating is outdoors on communal picnic tables . <sssss> they keep their menu simple , offering just a few sandwiches and salads . <sssss> the food items continue the theme of simplicity ... they use very high quality ingredients , so a lot of toppings are n't necessary . <sssss> i had fresh mozarella , basil , and proscuitto ... so good ! <sssss> and the bread , oh the bread ! <sssss> delicious !
?		what a drive , but what a nice was to spend an early afternoon ! <sssss> i had a groupon to use , so a friend and i hiked south mountain and then went over to the farm for lunch . <sssss> we stood in line raving over all the delicious food items displayed around us ... bottles of balsamic vinegars and spreads , salads with an array of brightly colored vegetables , personal homemade fruit pies ... i could go on for a while . <sssss> i decided on the turkey curry sandwich and a glass of lemonade . <sssss> the sandwich was a-mazing ! <sssss> the lemonade was fresh squeezed and tart and yummy . <sssss> bonus : they offer free tea and lemonade refills until 3pm . <sssss> we sat outside at a little table covered with a checkered table cloth and a potted flower centerpiece . <sssss> the weather was perfect and we enjoyed people watching -lrb- lots of babies and dogs at the farm -rrb- . <sssss> after a leisurely lunch , we strolled around the grounds -lrb- plentiful picnic tables and grassy areas for kids to run around -rrb- and over to maya 's farm area -lrb- where most of the ingredients are grown -rrb- ... so awesome to see where my food came from ! <sssss> the farm is a really enjoyable experience and a great place for locavores to visit . <sssss> i recommend it !
?		i 'm pretty anti-chain , but yard house has avoided my chain restaurant black-list . <sssss> they have a wide variety of food and beers on their menu . <sssss> i had been with friends several times and had n't found any dish that stood out , then i went with one friend who suggested the turkey burger ... jackpot ! <sssss> turkey burgers can sometimes be kind of bland wannabe burgers . <sssss> not this one at yard house . <sssss> it 's seasoned really well and comes with a delicious roasted tomato , melty mozzarella cheese and garlic aioli . <sssss> i do n't even particularly like tomatoes or mayonaise-based products , but this burger is delicious ! <sssss> yard house has a little something for everyone on their drink menu . <sssss> they serve lindeman 's framboise -lrb- a total girly-beer -rrb- , somewhat of a rare find at restaurants , so it 's a special treat to go have a glass .
?		my boyfriend and i went to district before a concert at the us airways center . <sssss> perfect location for a downtown event , plus they will validate your valet parking . <sssss> we went in time for their happy hour -lrb- which ends a 7pm -rrb- and sat at one of the bar tables . <sssss> very cool ambiance . <sssss> we had a great server who made helpful suggestions and guided us through the array of menu options . <sssss> i tried their red wine sangria -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- - it was a beautiful magenta color and was one of the better sangrias i 'd had in a long time . <sssss> i also had their pineapple lavender cocktail -lrb- not on happy hour - $ 10 -rrb- which is very tart and lemon-y . <sssss> not for everyone , but i loved it ! <sssss> they hand-make their drinks with fresh fruit -lrb- so they take a little while -rrb- and use fresh herbs grown on their rooftop garden . <sssss> my boyfriend picked the food and we indulged ! <sssss> all the appetizers were $ 4 -lrb- except for the nachos which were $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> the pretzel bite fondue included three pretzels definitely larger than a bite , maybe 3 or 4 bite-size . <sssss> the cheese was warm and melty . <sssss> good dish . <sssss> we also had the macaroni & cheese w / schreiner 's beer hots . <sssss> i think this one was our least favorite of all the dishes we ordered . <sssss> not that it was bad , it just did n't stand out . <sssss> a take on mac & cheese with cut up hotdog . <sssss> the nachos were topped with all the good stuff you 'd expect to find on nachos : gooey cheese , pico de gallo , guac , sour cream , and steak . <sssss> the chips were a little thicker , so they did n't break and get soggy . <sssss> finally , we had the buffalo sloppy joe sliders . <sssss> great flavor , would definitely get these again . <sssss> i 'm not in downtown phoenix very often , but district will definitely be at the top of my list next time i attend an event in the area .
?		i 've been in tanzy for drinks -lrb- they definitely have some good ones , but the one i remembered was the ginger sangria - memorable in a bad way . <sssss> it tasted like patchouli or as my boyfriend put it `` this tastes like a hippie '' -rrb- . <sssss> anyways , i had always been curious about the food . <sssss> a couple weeks ago we decided to go in for brunch and caught some of the football games at the bar -lrb- a perfect compromise ... football/bar for the boyfriend , nice atmosphere and good food for the lady -rrb- . <sssss> our friendly bartender handed us their brunch menu and said he would come back to explain their brunch buffet . <sssss> i looked at the menu and thought , what ??? <sssss> this is ridiculous ! <sssss> $ 20 for a standard eggs benedict ??? <sssss> turns out you can get the brunch only for $ 14 or you can get a dish + the brunch for the advertised price of that dish . <sssss> this also includes bottomless mimosas -lrb- their fresh squeezed oj was awesome -rrb- . <sssss> the buffet has charcuteries , cheeses , hummus , fruit , a variety of pastries and bagels , and a pancake station with at least 10 topping/filling options . <sssss> i was craving savory , so i ordered the omelet and my boyfriend got the breakfast club sandwich . <sssss> both were really good , but so filling i did n't need a lot from the buffet . <sssss> to summarize my experience , tanzy is a beautiful restaurant , has good food and friendly service . <sssss> and $ 14-20 for brunch with bottomless mimosas ... not too bad .
?		a nice selection of yogurt and toppings . <sssss> i usually get the tart yogurt with fruit on top , but they have a variety of other good flavors . <sssss> reasonable pricing -lrb- mid-level compared to other yogurt places -rrb- . <sssss> i 've always had friendly service . <sssss> good product , service , selection , and price ... yogurt builderz gets my vote .
?		some of our food was good , some was eh . <sssss> my boyfriend and i went to stax for lunch last friday . <sssss> neither of us had been there and we wanted a place with patio seating . <sssss> we started looking at the menu and matt said he was going to order two burgers ... he explained that the burgers are slider-sized after seeing the the `` what a pig ! '' <sssss> look on my face . <sssss> so we each ordered two mini-burgers , shared an order of tater tots , and split a pbj sandwich for dessert . <sssss> regular burger : good , solid standard burger bison burger : topped with an onion ring and peach bbq sauce . <sssss> pretty tasty . <sssss> i tend to like bison since it 's a little more lean . <sssss> turkey burger : sounded way better than it was . <sssss> very bland . <sssss> would not recommend . <sssss> tater tots : crunchy on the outside , soft on the inside . <sssss> ordered their spicy dipping sauce for $ 0.50 extra , but the regular old ketchup was better . <sssss> pbj : we shared their peanut butter and jelly sandwich for dessert . <sssss> it had almonds and banana in it too . <sssss> it was almost too sugary-sweet , but it was so small we only had one bite each , so it was a good little `` dessert '' to satisfy my sweet tooth . <sssss> overall , i might head back if i 'm in the area and craving a burger , but nothing outstanding compared to other great burger joints in town .
?		i heard from a friend that renegade had become their favorite dinner hangout spot , so i moved it to the top of my `` to try '' list . <sssss> i went to dinner famished after a 9 mile run . <sssss> i was ready to eat and eating is exactly what i did . <sssss> at our server 's suggestion we got the green chile pork stew ... and that first bite was so amazing . <sssss> the pork and cheese and green chile sauce with a hint of broth spooned into tortillas was heaven . <sssss> we also shared a spinach salad - candied pecans , bacon pieces , and an egg on top . <sssss> enjoyable . <sssss> we shared entrees . <sssss> i had the filet with their green peppercorn sauce and a side of green chili mac and cheese . <sssss> i knew i 'd love the mac and cheese from having it at roaring fork . <sssss> the filet was cooked perfectly and paired very well with the green peppercorn sauce -lrb- though it was neither green nor peppery -rrb- . <sssss> bf got the pork with the mushroom sauce -lrb- i liked the peppercorn sauce better -rrb- and the kale and bacon -lrb- in retrospect , i 'm noticing we kind of went crazy on the pork products that night -rrb- . <sssss> kale is definitely an acquired taste - i really enjoy it . <sssss> my boyfriend did n't like his first bite at all , but by the end of the meal was talking about what a big fan of kale he is . <sssss> the pork serving was enormous and for me , it was n't anything over-the-top special . <sssss> i 'd probably try something else next time . <sssss> we tried both their margaritas , both were okay . <sssss> we also had a couple good glasses of wine -lrb- a cab and a malbec blend -rrb- . <sssss> we did some really good eatin ' at renegade ... it was one of those indulgent meals where i had a hard time getting up and moving around afterward . <sssss> the service was very attentive and enjoyed sitting on the patio . <sssss> overall , excellent experience !
?		a true owner operated gem in scottsdale all because razz knows and cares . <sssss> he is an amazing chef who is fearless and cooks and entertains seamlessly throughout the evening . <sssss> his food is wonderful and complex with many layers of flavors and ingredients you will often not find elsewhere . <sssss> he loves food and wine and his place reflects this . <sssss> the best and only tip i can give you is to sit that the bar -lrb- chef 's table -rrb- and do the tastings meal . <sssss> he will bring out small plates one after the other until you are full . <sssss> of if you are like me , till bursting ! <sssss> the last time i dined there with a group i asked razz for a pinot noir recommendation and he steered us toward the cheapest in his lot . <sssss> he was correct in that it was an amazing wine but this goes to show his style , honestly and integrity . <sssss> his food is the same way . <sssss> if you are into art he has an amazing selection . <sssss> you could have fun just walking about the place . <sssss> the atmosphere is great and it usually has just the right amount of people there . <sssss> everyone seems to know razz . <sssss> great place , great chef . <sssss> thanks razz !
?		what happened to this place ? <sssss> it used to be one of my favorite places and now the food has gone way down hill . <sssss> worse , our family has gotten food poisoning the last two times they ate there so it is no more for us . <sssss> what a shame this place used to be amazing .
?		great food for sure but that is it . <sssss> unless you are shopping for groceries then do n't expect much of anything you would not find in a cafeteria . <sssss> yet for some reason this place just works . <sssss> the service is unusually good in a place like this and the food comes out fast and delicious . <sssss> i have had about half of the food on this menu and have never been disappointed . <sssss> come to haji 's to be full and chat with some friends over good food . <sssss> it may have you searching for more napkins but your belly will be happy .
?		i like capital grille and living in austin i had n't been in like 3 years so i was staying over by kierland and wanted a place that has great food and would n't mind my yappy puggle on their patio . <sssss> we called cg to see if they allow dogs and they do . <sssss> when we got there another person had their dog on the patio . <sssss> the server -lrb- sarah or jennifer ??? <sssss> very nice , short blond hair -rrb- was very attentive and got us some water and also our dog water . <sssss> i 'm not the type that expects restaurants to do that for our dog , he 's content to sit on the ground and have nothing , but when the restaurant and staff do make accommodations for our dog , we really really appreciate it . <sssss> that being said , they 're dog friendly ... add a 6 star for that . <sssss> the food , amazing like always , calamari was perfectly cooked and a lot of it . <sssss> the server brought a sample of a pineapple vodka drink and i liked it so i went with one of those and then also wine . <sssss> the porcini rubbed delmonico is the star of this place and it was awesome . <sssss> wife had lamb and was perfect . <sssss> so , another perfect experience for us at capital grille . <sssss> good thing we 're moving back to valley , so i can eat there more often .
?		yummy !! <sssss> pecan wood permeates the establishment . <sssss> rack of ribs : pork spare ribs , cooked so long that the bones were pliable , meat seperated from bone instantly . <sssss> joes bbq sauce is very very good and i love the habanero bbq myself pulled pork sandwich : very good and same super tender meat with same super bbq sauce ... bun was okay side mac n cheese and pit beans - both awesome the best part was the homemade root-beer . <sssss> i ca n't put in words how tastey craft root-beer is . <sssss> this tasted down home and not like coke with rootbeer syrup . <sssss> i wish they would stock birch-beer in place of the red creme soda . <sssss> birch beer i think is much more tastey than rootbeer but all in all joes is a + + to have joe 's in your neighborhood is great , good country bbq
?		since my review of texaz , i thought it would be good to review pcg kiddycorner to texaz . <sssss> picture a strip mall ... you walk in ... lights turned low , red walls , dark carpet ... intimate ... perfect ... you 've forgotten about the strip mall . <sssss> the restaurant was one of the first restaurants that i tried when i moved to az in 1998 . <sssss> thank you to my aunt marge for taking me to this little gem . <sssss> the food is what i like to call great american cuisine elevated . <sssss> pcg can , in my book call itself the most dependable dinner in the valley . <sssss> i have frequented this establishment many of times and have never had to complain about a single thing in the restaurant ... maybe when they closed for that short time back in 2000 i bitched a little . <sssss> when a restaurant puts mac n ' cheese on a menu ... they are dying to be critiqued hard ... so i use mac n ' cheese as a measure of quality . <sssss> mac n ' cheese is such a bad name because kraft and velveeta have raped it of legitamacy in the culinary world . <sssss> now pcg makes a darn creamy rich flavorful mac n ' cheese and that to me signifies attention to quality . <sssss> i have had bad mnc at other `` deconstructed '' restaurants but pcg does n't stray to far from the point of the dish ... and they are successful . <sssss> i also fancy the pot roast or the pork tenderloin . <sssss> to start i seem to always get the black bean soup and always happy i did . <sssss> great place !! <sssss> will always be included as my diamond in the rough restaurant .
?		yay , even though i miss living in coronado i am glad to be back at the melrose america 's . <sssss> if you have read any of my reviews you know how disappointed i was with coronado america 's rude service that i boycotted that particular location . <sssss> now that i am back around melrose i can once again enjoy happy hour tacos and drinks , or their delicious breakfast burro and cochata . <sssss> if 7th st let you down try 7th ave.
?		let me say this up front , my wife used to work @ st. francis so we are fortunate to know the servers and staff , this always makes for a friendly environment . <sssss> i have never had any item that i did not enjoy , in fact i have a new appreciation for fresh ingredients after having the pleasure of dining here . <sssss> chef aaron can be compared to picasso with a brush , or even stephen king with a pen , except he perfects his ideas with kitchen utensils putting his work on plates . <sssss> alex , korbi and david serve great drinks . <sssss> kayla and dylan have both served us and are always attentive to their tables . <sssss> brunch is excellent , i would recommend the egg sandwich or eggs benedict , and you ca n't go wrong with any of the baked goods . <sssss> happy hour is fantastic , very good deals . <sssss> for lunch i would recommend the french onion burger , always cooked to what you order and one of the tastiest burgers i have had in the valley . <sssss> the menu is seasonal so do n't be afraid to try something new . <sssss> during your wait enjoy the building , the lines are amazing , and there is a mural from local artist dose on the second floor . <sssss> thank you st. francis .
?		the `` dillo '' is where it 's at if you want a good meal and drink . <sssss> plenty of tvs for sports and horse racing if that is your thing . <sssss> excellent sports bar , friendly staff , good food , and did i mention the drinks ?
?		if you love beer then come here . <sssss> great craft tap selection , plus they include the serving glass type . <sssss> my favorite menu item , so far , are the spam sliders . <sssss> spam you say , yes ! <sssss> give it a try , it is far different then what you may have been served as a kid . <sssss> we always stick with appetizers when coming here and have enjoyed the sausage platter , fries and gravy , and the wings . <sssss> i must admit that the only thing i have been wow 'd by were the sliders . <sssss> you definitely should give this place a shot and do yourself a favor by ordering a flight of beers to find that one you truly enjoy .
?		yeah , its that good ! <sssss> this place has a complete relaxed atmosphere . <sssss> there were several customers sitting outside with their dogs enjoying their favorite fro-yo . <sssss> if i am craving frozen yogurt next time or any type of dessert for that matter , i will be stopping by this place . <sssss> i tried the dulche leche and chocolate flavors and they were delicious !
?		we no longer buy our meat from this place because the quality of service and product has been going down and down over the last year or so . <sssss> after having to throw away the ground beef for the second time , we finally made the switch to i-mart for all our meat related purchases . <sssss> when we would ask for extra lean ground beef , we would have to pay an astronomically high price and it was still not extra lean . <sssss> it was full of fat and seems like they were mixing in lamb with it too because it stank like hell . <sssss> i was getting tired of being badly treated by the butchers who conveniently went deaf when we would ask for something -lrb- not in arabic -rrb- but would be completely on their toes helping whoever spoke in arabic exclusively with them . <sssss> one time when i asked for a woman to repeat herself behind the counter , she literally stared and me for a few seconds and moved over and started helping someone else . <sssss> i guess we are not good enough for them to help over there . <sssss> we still like the al-hana restaurant and they do offer some good spices that we will go in and purchase but we will no longer be using their meat counter .
?		i would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids . <sssss> this is a no frills airline . <sssss> nothing special . <sssss> there was no tv , period on our 5 hour flight from ny . <sssss> all the kids in the plane were going nuts . <sssss> the seats are very cramped and small . <sssss> the plane seemed very old . <sssss> go delta , if you have kids .
?		you can find all sorts of fresh halal meat and chicken here . <sssss> the butcher , hassan is friendly . <sssss> they prepare everything like you want it . <sssss> there is also a restaurant up front which only serves halal food called al-hana . <sssss> the beef shawarma is awesome and so is the rotisserie chicken served with a garlic sauch which is to die for . <sssss> and of course it is all halal which is great ! <sssss> we used to live in tucson and we still would come to baiz market to purchase all our halal meat because they keep it clean unlike the other so called halal meat stores we have visited . <sssss> the store is pretty big and they carry indian masalas , european cheeses , a variety of spices and canned goods and also some cutlery and pots and stuff to sell . <sssss> you will also be able to find a hookah here . <sssss> they have the best and most fresh pita breads too . <sssss> plus they have a large variety of fresh vegetables . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable except for the halal meat and chicken . <sssss> awesome place . <sssss> neighborhood is a little shady and you need to know your way around downtown . <sssss> there are no other shops around this place so when we go here , we just go to this shop and back home .
?		the scrambled eggs with croissant were good . <sssss> ambiance is non-existent . <sssss> no french bakery feel at all . <sssss> the products looked semi-appealing . <sssss> had a really hard time trying to find the damn place as it is hidden under a gargantuan office building . <sssss> i would not by any means call this a `` great '' french bakery .
?		we were there saturday night during the sunnyslope art walk and experienced just a 25 minute wait for four for seating on the patio . <sssss> do n't enter from the street , because the woman behind the bar did not nicely tell me to see the hostess on the other side . <sssss> do n't put yourself through that -- just enter from the parking lot/patio side . <sssss> having said that , the patio was gorgeous . <sssss> there 's a nice fire pit , lots of little seating areas , and gorgeous old trees and vines . <sssss> the service , on the other hand , was pretty terrible . <sssss> the sweet , young hostess tried her best to get us served , but it was futile . <sssss> we sat at a dirty table for 10 min . <sssss> or so . <sssss> then sat another 15 before she got a waitress for us . <sssss> our meals came out in a timely manner , but we had to ask for more water , ask for the the wine menu , etc. . <sssss> we got so tired of waiting we decided against another round and dessert . <sssss> what surprised me the most was that there seemed to be no one experienced supervising a really young staff . <sssss> no one -lrb- like a manager or owner -rrb- came through to check on tables or apologize for the wait at the table and lack of service . <sssss> the food was a bit better . <sssss> my girlfriend had the blt and chips . <sssss> the sandwich was large and a bit charred but she said it was great . <sssss> i had the bruschetta . <sssss> i highly recommend the spicy copa and pesto , which was excellent . <sssss> i 'd pass on the brie , apple and figs , as the figs were terribly bitter and the over-sauced bread quickly became soggy . <sssss> the wine and beer lists were reasonably priced for by the glass or bottle . <sssss> we 're hoping they improve on service for our next visit . <sssss> it smelled so good that we 'd like to give them another shot . <sssss> i just hope it was n't actually the little caesar 's nearby ...
?		we were the unfortunate recipients of $ 200 in romano 's gift cards , so we 've eaten there a few times recently . <sssss> the birthday dinner we had was ok . <sssss> we started with some of their new appetizers . <sssss> pass on them . <sssss> the pesto bean bruschetta lacked flavor -lrb- where was the pesto ?? <sssss> -rrb- and should have been served warm . <sssss> the peppers were ok . <sssss> the stuffed mushrooms were just boring . <sssss> our entrees came next . <sssss> i had a pumpkin ravioli , which was quite good . <sssss> hubby got the trio and did n't even bring the spaghetti home . <sssss> he said it was terrible . <sssss> birthday dessert was chocolate cake -- it was so bland it went uneaten . <sssss> the canoli were n't worth it , either . <sssss> we went back on a saturday night . <sssss> was told there was a 45 minute wait . <sssss> after 45 minutes they started seating people who arrived after us . <sssss> when i complained , she said they had a reservation . <sssss> i call bullsh-t on that . <sssss> then they seated another group that arrived after us . <sssss> then she said there were 7 more parties before us . <sssss> i told her to look around -- there were n't 7 parties left to be seated . <sssss> i was pissed . <sssss> there was no apology . <sssss> and no one over the age of 35 to complain too . <sssss> our waiter was aaron . <sssss> it took him 8 minutes to greet us . <sssss> we asked him three times for water for the table . <sssss> we never received the promised plate to share our woefully under-dressed salad . <sssss> i had the salmon entree and hubby had the porkchop . <sssss> both were cooked beautifully -lrb- and i had asked for the salmon pretty rare -rrb- -- really perfect . <sssss> too bad they had no flavor . <sssss> it was such a shame . <sssss> it was a terrible dinner , over all ... f -- me , i still have $ 40 to spend . <sssss> hubby and i went several years ago and loved it . <sssss> what happened ??
?		la condesa , i give up on you . <sssss> we try and try to excuse the terrible service , but no more . <sssss> it 's not worth it . <sssss> it 's too slow and inattentive and they just do n't give a damn , so i 'll take my $ 33 elsewhere . <sssss> this time we were disappointed by the food , too . <sssss> we returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless , and you brought us new ones after we finished eating . <sssss> you drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta -lrb- sorry , lonche -rrb- . <sssss> how do i pick it up and eat it ? <sssss> in the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss . <sssss> but not even that makes up for the service . <sssss> : -lrb-
?		very sexy place where people love to be seen . <sssss> very pretentious but i liked it ! <sssss> food is just ok - i have had better !
?		i stopped in to this fine establishment for the first time since i have lived in scottsdale and it was awesome . <sssss> i have eaten at other j alexanders before - and was always a fan - but this one rocked . <sssss> i had the steak kebobs - and they are amazing . <sssss> perfectly seared and medium - pink yumminess . <sssss> the cocktails were flowing and i had an awesome time . <sssss> the people around me were all super social and even though i was dining alone at the bar - i met new friends fast .
?		did you know that the capital grill is doing their generous pour for the summer ? <sssss> me either !! <sssss> i found out quickly enough though ! <sssss> so first let me say - i was lucky enough to be seated in the section of the most amazing waitress i have had the pleasure of dining with in many years ! <sssss> her name is sharon - and if you are making a reservation - i would ask for her - because she turned a mediocre night for me into an outstanding night . <sssss> her personality and passion for what she does shines in every word she uses . <sssss> i was intrigued and in awe from the first second !! <sssss> we ordered the wines - yes all of them ! <sssss> we drank well over our fair share - and loved every second . <sssss> let me describe dessert - coconut cream pie - oh my !!! <sssss> dreamy , decadent and a perfect ending to my feast . <sssss> i started with beef carpaccio - which was perfect . <sssss> the simplicity of this dish was amazing . <sssss> then i had the swordfish - which was prepared perfectly . <sssss> most restaurants tend to over do this dish - but capital grill nailed it ! <sssss> after all of my indulging , i was leaving and could not help but tell everyone , including sharon what a treat she was . <sssss> the funny part is - she actually took the time to send me a thank you card in the mail . <sssss> when was the last time anyone took that kind of time , in today 's world ? <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and see sharon again and of course have yummy food !!!
?		this place is always packed - bring some patience . <sssss> the food is very fresh and fantastic . <sssss> i have tried several dishes and none of them disappoint me .
?		-lrb- lyrics - imagine dragons - radioactive -rrb- i 'm ordering up shots and drinks i wipe my mouth as i eat the crust -lrb- pizza crust -rrb- i 'm breathing in the aromatics i 'm dining in , reviewing it , then checking out on the foodie bus this is it , the evo atmosphere yum ! <sssss> i 'm eating up , i taste it in my mouth enough to make my systems blow welcome to the evo , to the evo welcome to the evo , to the evo whoa , oh , oh , oh , oh , whoa , oh , oh , oh , it 's evo scottsdale , evo scottsdale whoa , oh , oh , oh , oh , whoa , oh , oh , oh , it 's evo scottsdale , evo scottsdale evo is located in a location where all the restaurants appear ... . <sssss> then disappears . <sssss> this is not a joke . <sssss> i reviewed several restaurants in that location and none is around . <sssss> now comes evo . <sssss> evo serves up modern american italian cuisine . <sssss> i 've heard so much about this place so my foodie friends and i finally convened and went for it . <sssss> i did some sharing after a free fireball shot after you check-in with the yelp app . <sssss> whooo ... now my breath smells fresh haha ! <sssss> my buddy and i ordered the margarita pizza and added sausage and the evo salad . <sssss> the pizza was okay , kind of tasted like pre-made dough . <sssss> the ingredients a top was nothing spectacular . <sssss> the evo salad was my favorite . <sssss> nicely charred kale and brussel sprouts and the pine nuts gave it that extra roast and crunch . <sssss> the aroma was nutty and a woody smell . <sssss> overall , one of the best salads i say around ! <sssss> service was good and the place itself is really chill and cool . <sssss> if anything another round of drinks and the evo salad is a must . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha he he he he he he he he he ... . <sssss> . <sssss> -lrb- woody woodpecker -rrb- for those of you old enough to know the woody woodpecker this place is a like an homage to the character . <sssss> the only way you 'll find this gem is by catching the eyes of the woodpecker off indian school rd. . <sssss> at first sight you would n't think much of this place from the outside . <sssss> once you enter it 's a nice cozy chill atmosphere . <sssss> i 'm glad this place is here far from the party scene of s. scottsdale . <sssss> everyone seems pretty relaxed and open . <sssss> they 're not here to impress anyone ; they 're here to have a good time . <sssss> the place in general is covered in `` wood '' and has a cabin look . <sssss> thus , the `` woody '' part makes sense . <sssss> moving , past the main doors and towards the back and going west of the building is the game room . <sssss> tad bit odd for a lounge , but totally awesome . <sssss> shuffle boards , skeet ball and darts in the back room while you have a drink with your best buds in case you did n't want to just sit around at the bar . <sssss> the large lcd tvs shows the game of the night while you sit back and enjoy . <sssss> the woody also serves up some cozy comfort food . <sssss> my buddy and i ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwich . <sssss> i was n't too awed about the sandwich , but the toast on it made sense to my palate as i dipped it into the roasted tomato soup . <sssss> the soup was delicious ! <sssss> i pounded it down with a couple of drinks and my night was complete ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		not bad , i 've been to other locations , but this one would probably be my favorite for 2 reasons . <sssss> it 's the closet one to my place : -rrb- , 2nd their patio area is on 2nd floor overlooking the streets . <sssss> maybe i like looking over people and watching them or something , but it 's rather fun haha ! <sssss> gordon biersch is always known for their garlic fries -- do n't go to the gym the next day i tell ya if you have a bunch of these blah ! <sssss> they have their own gordon biersch brew of beers ; i do n't recall each , but they have beer tasting flight which can be fun . <sssss> definitely bring your group of friends to the place !
?		cambodian cuisine is definitely not one of those common cuisine you would pick when someone ask , `` what you wan na eat ? '' <sssss> -lrb- do n't say i do n't know ... ! <sssss> -rrb- however , now you can say how about cambodian ? <sssss> yes , the one and only one cambodian restaurant in phoenix is here ! <sssss> we had a group gathering here for dinner -lrb- naaap -rrb- and the food was delicious ! <sssss> i ca n't say the actual name , but i 'll use my best engrish - beef & shrimp marinated salad/beef skewers/pot roast soup/fried tilapia topped with mango . <sssss> okay sounds to me like a typical cuisine , but no dude ... it was awesome . <sssss> found out cambodian cuisine is not spicy like i thought it would be . <sssss> our service was great , this when the restaurant was booked by our entire group - kudos ! <sssss> ambience was really homey - i gather if i lived in a cambodian household that is ... the decors were originally from cambodia purchased by the owner -lrb- yut -rrb- . <sssss> i did n't want to touch anything ; felt like i was in a museum . <sssss> towards the end of the night i start to make dessert - yes `` me '' was cooking ! <sssss> they showed us how and what ingredients . <sssss> needless , to say i did n't perfect the art , but it still passed and was yummy ! <sssss> take that chef ramsey ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		i was a skeptic of this chemist of brew . <sssss> needless to say , i was n't too far off . <sssss> this is great for a night out with the boys to watch the game . <sssss> that 's all i can say since i would n't recommend coming here to chat . <sssss> i ordered me a beer and some fried fish and chips . <sssss> i do n't like soggy food , but i guess that 's how it comes here . <sssss> the fried fish was laid on top of my garlic fries , which were way greasy . <sssss> as the fish and fries came together it was a hot soggy mess . <sssss> i might want to add tasteless too . <sssss> the place definitely has a pub look and feel . <sssss> live music when i came that night , but the football game was going on too . <sssss> rowdy fans and loud music does n't go well , but i guess it would n't matter after a few drinks . <sssss> our service was good , but splitting checks again can be a challenge . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		starbucks with a dash of alcholic beverage - sweeeet ! <sssss> just when you thought it could n't be improved well you 're wrong ! <sssss> press is a cute little cafe located in city north , unfortunately : -lrb- however , this place brings the smiles back . <sssss> trendy and hip for sure . <sssss> food here is wonderful - light sandwiches and salads with ingredients that bring a bang to your mouth -- mmmm . <sssss> did n't try their wine , but no one can stop me now - next time i 'm back let 's do a toast ! <sssss> enjoy !
?		i can dig the bbq here . <sssss> food was pretty good and portions were just right . <sssss> i appreciate the wide selection of bbq items , but i only ordered two - half ck & pull pork and they were both good . <sssss> decor is alright , but i 've definitely seen a better bbq joint or i guess i should say more southern style-like . <sssss> it 's a chain and i got ta give them a break - `` a '' for effort . <sssss> i really like the porch style seating , but really wonder what it 's like during the hot summers hmmm ... just makes me skirm when i think about eating and sweating at the same time - yuck ! <sssss> i got ta make a come back to taste the rest of the bbq items for sure ! <sssss> so if you 're craving for some bbq hit me up ! <sssss> : -rrb-
?		so apparently the creators of tk 's urban tavern wanted great food with great atmosphere where people ate ... ummm sure makes sense right . <sssss> okay , why not , sounds like a great concept . <sssss> this place was an eye catcher simply because if it 's location on the corner . <sssss> the contemporary look gave it the relaxing chill feel . <sssss> we ordered some sides the mac & cheese and a salad with goat cheese -- both were awesome ! <sssss> however , i ca n't say our entrees were great - 33 % . <sssss> my pulled pork sandwich was bland , and according to my friend her burger was bland . <sssss> only thing that popped was the scallops over a shrimp risotto . <sssss> so in the end 33 % , which i 'll give it an okay in my book . <sssss> service overall was great and on the dot . <sssss> in any case , i do n't think tk would be my first choice next time i 'm at scottsdale quarters . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		-lrb- lyrics - kelis - milkshake -rrb- fox concept brings all of us to the yard , and they 're like it 's tastier than before , damn right it 's tastier than before , you can dine here , but they have to charge fox concept brings all of us to the yard , and they 're like it 's tastier than before , damn right it 's tastier than before , you can dine here , but they have to charge i know you want it , the thing that makes you hungry , what all of us go crazy for . <sssss> they lose their minds , the way we dine , i think its time la la-la la la , warm it up . <sssss> lala-lalala , we 're all waiting the yard is an interesting place . <sssss> two different dining experiences ; one from what i gather a seafood/oyster restaurant and the other is the culinary dropout . <sssss> culinary dropout i would describe is modern american cuisine . <sssss> great small bites to share so we ordered the pretzel with cheese , bacon with grilled cheese and the mussels . <sssss> the pretzels were soft and doughy while the creamy cheese helped with the chewing process , if you know what i mean . <sssss> the bacon and grilled cheese sandwich really worked well together . <sssss> that 's gon na be my new thing grilled cheese and bacon ; why did n't i think of this ! <sssss> finally , the mussels with the broth , which i still ca n't figure what it is ... yummy ! <sssss> overall my favorite of the night and definitely a recommendation . <sssss> drinks are pretty pricey , and the games around `` the yard '' are pretty cool . <sssss> ping pong tables , foosball , and corn hole games spread across the place . <sssss> it reminds me of an east coast roof top bar feel with the couches and the live band rocking away . <sssss> it can get real loud here , but if you ca n't handle the noise keep your butt at home and enjoy a glass of wine . <sssss> in the end , this is the closet thing to a night life in central area of phoenix . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		this place is n't bad at all . <sssss> i 've definitely had better tofu soup . <sssss> however if you 're hungry for some korean food ; it 'll do the work . <sssss> service was good not too much to complain about - it is what it is . <sssss> all the staffs were wearing black - johnny cash korean style !! <sssss> decor was pretty cheap and basic asian style . <sssss> funny thing i thought - they were bumping hip hop . <sssss> guess you got ta be hip and tough to have your kim chi here -- i think i 'm tough enough : -rrb- - enjoy !
?		my favorite place on a monday or tuesday night ! <sssss> $ 20 for a huge plate of bruschettas and a bottle of wine ... need i say more ? <sssss> the atmosphere is just right . <sssss> low key and classy feel . <sssss> i almost want to say starbucks for wine , but i think it 's pushing it . <sssss> i do n't mind attending this fine dine and wine place any other night , but if you 're free on monday or tuesday ... why not ?
?		pad see ew ! <sssss> it 's what i always order or the dragon noodles if they serve it . <sssss> wow me with the pad see ew and it 's all good . <sssss> how 's this place do , well i was wow 'd and in sweatin ' -- fire breathe ! <sssss> i generally gage a thai place by how well their fried noodles taste . <sssss> kudos -- however , i ca n't say the same for the appetizers . <sssss> fried tofu need more crunch ! <sssss> our service was excellent and do n't `` phuket '' the beer : -rrb- great hh prices on the drinks . <sssss> i like the ambience , but i wish thai restaurants would get more creative with their design . <sssss> i know it 's a thai restaurant when i see one . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		nice patio and large enough for a crowd . <sssss> x-mas lights and the water fountain reminds me of the friends opening credit - yes , i 'll be there for you ! <sssss> came here with my gang and it was buffet style but regardless i must rate the place . <sssss> we had a nice baby green salad with some balsamic vinaigrette , but things went downhill from here fast . <sssss> let 's start with the pork ; cough ! <sssss> cough ! <sssss> -lrb- pound the chest ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> someone pass me some water cause as much as i chewed it did n't go down - it was so dry it soaked up my saliva ! <sssss> atop of it were some chili flakes so that did n't help much . <sssss> the stuffed chicken came with a nice creamy sauce , but i do n't recall what it tasted like . <sssss> the pork overwhelmed me and to add insult to injury do n't serve mashed potatoes to dry out my tongue more ! <sssss> regardless , a friend of mine made a great point ; we are served what we did not order . <sssss> saved ! <sssss> therefore , i shall return on another visit to give my full report so stay tuned !
?		i must say they really spruce this place up . <sssss> makes my vietnamese food taste better too i think : -rrb- not to say i dislike hole in walls , but ao sen really paid attention to their decors . <sssss> to the food ! <sssss> we ordered an appetizer to start - had coconut milk and noodles , forgot what it was called , but like my friend said ; `` can you go wrong with coconut milk . '' <sssss> i order a # 29 - i do n't speak or read viet , but it sure tasted dandy ! <sssss> i was trying to be different and not order the `` phonomenal '' - maybe it was the feel of the place ; it just did n't make me really want pho . <sssss> anyways , # 29 was a pork/beef lettuce noodle wrap - fun and yum ! <sssss> chances or return very high ... enjoy !
?		i have to admit i expected more from this place than i got . <sssss> here 's the deal , you want decent hh for a low price ? <sssss> you got it ! <sssss> you want good service too ? <sssss> no problem . <sssss> you want good food -- whoa there cowboy ! <sssss> if this place was small dive i would totally understand , but hey you just happen to be in the scottsdale quarter where everything must be a hit right ? <sssss> right !? <sssss> needless to say i appreciate our aussie bartender he was cool ! <sssss> the ambience is alright -- not my cup of tea -- got that cigar smoking lounge , sport bar flare and a stage for live band just in case . <sssss> do n't get me wrong i dig live bands . <sssss> maybe just not in this setting . <sssss> prices , like i said were good , but i guess you get for what you pay for - enjoy !
?		suavemente , besame yo quiero restaurant mexico besandorne otra vez suave , besame besame suave , yo quiero restaurant mexico sauve , okay-o i do n't know spanish sauve , but i really like this song besame indeed , man i was totally hungry walking into restaurant mexico ! <sssss> this little shop down on mill ave. after a few drinks or two . <sssss> this place hit the spot . <sssss> i ca n't say it was the best i ever had . <sssss> however , the service was really good . <sssss> i ordered the basic taco meal with beans and rice . <sssss> like most mexican restaurants they offer free chips and salsa . <sssss> salsa was good and the chips seem pretty solid in a good way . <sssss> my taco entree came quick right after i order leading me to think of it like cafeteria food . <sssss> i guess it was so quick i had in mind some lady slopping it onto my plate while smoking a cigarette . <sssss> i 'm sure that 's not the case . <sssss> moreover , my tacos were good . <sssss> nice shredded beef in a deep fried taco shell . <sssss> my favorites were the rice because they were a tad bit different from what i was used to . <sssss> mexican rice is generally pretty bland , but here it was nice soft and sweet . <sssss> one of the best i 've had i must add ! <sssss> overall , experience at the restaurant mexico is good . <sssss> it 's right in the heart of college town so my surprise was the pricing . <sssss> i guess when i went to college long long long time ago food was much cheaper ! <sssss> wow kids are rich these days ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		get off of my fork get into my mouth get off of that grill get into some sauce -lrb- bbq -rrb- get into my belly yum yum , yeah get outta my mind get into my life oooooooooh oh i said hey -lrb- hey -rrb- you -lrb- you -rrb- get into my belly -lrb- lyrics - billy ocean - get into my car -rrb- pork on a fork was showcased on drive-in , dives , and diners with guy fieri not too long ago . <sssss> from there they 've became a hit and won numerous awards , plus rave reviews both on yelp and from foodies around the valley . <sssss> needless to say , this place is pretty darn good would n't you say ! <sssss> my office is close by so whenever i get a chance i try to hit the fork . <sssss> their pulled pork sandwich is what i would consider the quintessential pulled pork meal . <sssss> with sides of fingerling potatoes and coleslaw . <sssss> good ' o boys meal i guess , but man the pork and soft and tender ; add some spicy bbq and finger licking good -- yummy ! <sssss> portions here are modest i think so you wo n't over eat in my opinion . <sssss> the place itself started in modest fashion . <sssss> when i first came there was maybe 6 tables max , but now they have an entire huge patio in the back . <sssss> let 's just after having a meal here you 'll need more room - wink ! <sssss> again , this place is a dive so take the boys out and leave the dating scene out ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		oh fez ! <sssss> what country was that guy from again ? <sssss> : -rrb- i rather enjoy fez , i really do n't expect much from this place but they always deliver . <sssss> sweet potato fries with cinnamon ... yum ! <sssss> their menu is innovative ... things i would never thought that would go well together . <sssss> yet , it works ... it really really works . <sssss> : -rrb- if you looking to grab a drink or two ... not bad spot to pick in downtown phoenix .
?		chinese pho !? <sssss> how about vietnamese fried rice ? <sssss> well needless to say maxim is a mixture of two cultures . <sssss> my two cultures it happens to be and what i am - half vietnamese and half chinese . <sssss> so our waitress and some of the staffs are speaking in cantonese and serving up some pho . <sssss> eh ! <sssss> i 'm not one to judge . <sssss> i order me some pho since i heard this place was one of the better pho places in town . <sssss> i have to admit it was a lot different from most pho places , but that 's about it . <sssss> i did enjoy it and now that i think about it i 'm glad i did n't order the big boy bowl . <sssss> i can only eat so much and so much i ate . <sssss> the broth was nice and hot and had that bold brown color . <sssss> my noodles were obviously not soaked well since i had to untangle it before eating it . <sssss> i do n't like to see or do that , thus it 's a negative in my book . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		for what it is ... meh it 's okay . <sssss> food is edible and will get you full for sure . <sssss> i 'm not all into the decor - tad bit tacky , but i whatever floats your boat . <sssss> service was lacking granted i understand lunch rushes , but seriously you do n't have to ask if i need a refill 10 times when my glass is still half full - where 's my tamales anyways ! <sssss> i guess if you 're really craving for some mexican food it 'll do the job just fine .
?		-lrb- lyrics - george michael - faith -rrb- well i guess it would be nice if i could taste your craft beer i know not everybody has got a brewery like yours but i 've got to sip twice before i give my heart away and i know all the games you will play because it 's on direc tv too ! <sssss> oh but i need some pizza from that hunger cry time to pick my fork up off the plate oh , when that pie comes out with that aroma well , it takes a strong appetite baby but i 'm showin you my mouth cause ' i got ta have fate i got ta have fate because i got ta have fate , a fate , a fate i got ta have fate , a fate , a fate fate is a local brewing company located in scottsdale . <sssss> there used to be life around here back in the days when devil 's martini existed . <sssss> still some small hot spots here and there ; the there is fate . <sssss> the only beer brewing restaurant around ; this cute little brewery spices up the night life back into the area . <sssss> i shared the olive side and a capicola pizza with a pal . <sssss> if you like olives this was a delight . <sssss> nicely dripping in it 's own juice with a salty punch to your palates . <sssss> the firewood pizza that we ordered was okay i thought . <sssss> the crust got dried out quickly and the toppings did the same . <sssss> kept on drinking to finish it off ! <sssss> drinking was not what i did here though . <sssss> i 'm not a big fan of craft beers , but can appreciate it . <sssss> we sampled all their beers and my favorite and also strongest was the belgo american tripel . <sssss> strong indeed cause i started to buzz a little after one ! <sssss> light weight here ! <sssss> anyways , the other beer were strong also and extra bitter to me . <sssss> almost like an ipa which i despise ! <sssss> all you ipa drinkers can hate ... go ahead . <sssss> overall , the atmosphere is great and the service was awesome . <sssss> drinks were fine , but not my cup of tea and the food was okay . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		-lrb- lyrics - adele - set fire to the rain -rrb- i 'll eat it in , a bag and as it cooks , i 'll add the spice to it it was dark as i stir it over until you added to your menu and you saved me my palate , it 's strong but my appetite were far too weak to stay away from your ads without falling to my feet but there 's a side to you that i never knew , never knew all the time i thought it was only in a bag was never true , never true and at the prices you had , i would always buy ; always buy -lrb- $ .25 a bag ! <sssss> -rrb- but i had ramen at the posh ! <sssss> savour the taste as i stuffed my face ! <sssss> let it burn while i cry cause i could taste it screaming with flavors , with flavors ! <sssss> posh is an improvisational kitchen , which means like improv comedy they create as they go . <sssss> well somewhat i guess ... they utilize seasonal ingredients to create a daily menu . <sssss> you pick and choose what meals you want from a list , which often times range from 3-7 courses . <sssss> if you ever been to restaurant week then it 's a similar concept . <sssss> the night i went was ramen noodles night or late night japanese eats ! <sssss> i do n't really know if they really eat this late in japan , but i guess that 's what we 're doing ! <sssss> there were 3 different noodle dishes and 2 japanese beers . <sssss> the noodles were sesame , soy , and miso , while beer selection was orion and coedo . <sssss> i was n't totally thrilled about either of the beer . <sssss> along with the noodles we ordered the okonomiyaki , a pancake like dish with came with sprouts and bacon . <sssss> i thought it was good and savory , but the mayo and bacon was quite overpowering . <sssss> i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , but less bacon please ... i ordered the soy broth with my ramen while my friends seem to all order the sesame . <sssss> i did n't get a chance to taste anybody else 's dish , but mine was pretty good . <sssss> it came with braised pork , scallions , and i believe radishes . <sssss> nice and warm and yes i know on a warm summer phx night , but it worked . <sssss> ramen is so adaptable to so many ingredients . <sssss> to me , it 's all about the broth . <sssss> if you can create a good broth then you can put tree bark and chocolate in the ramen and i 'll still eat it ! <sssss> according to the waiter , which i might add did n't really do a good job , said they intend to have ramen night every wednesday starting at 9pm . <sssss> so gear up you ramen fans cause now you have a place to go every wednesday night ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		ever yelped so much you forgot if you yelped about a place or not ? <sssss> well lucky me -- i forgot about this place , then again maybe for good reason . <sssss> for all the hype and cool designs -- the food really did n't match . <sssss> i ordered some curry and chicken - it was okay , but i was really hungry so maybe that 's why it was okay . <sssss> the plating was nice , but maybe that 's how they get you ! <sssss> how about the price ? <sssss> extremely pricy for what you get -- i get more excited paying to gas up my car ! <sssss> okay the ambience is pretty cool - the polynesian style decors are nice and fun . <sssss> service ? <sssss> well we had a large group and i can never understand this , but when you 're a waiter ; you should prepare for large and small groups . <sssss> i was a damn fine waiter in my times and i was always ready to rock ! <sssss> i wo n't say they did n't do a good job , but -- they did n't do a good job -- : -rrb- i lied ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		i 'm all about the food . <sssss> ladies , this place was made to cater to your needs . <sssss> champagne , tea , and girlfriends . <sssss> think i was one of the only few dudes besides the bartender around . <sssss> i like my odds . <sssss> i saw a few guys walk in and walk out ... haha this is n't their local dive bar i guess . <sssss> narcisse is a chic , modern , and hip . <sssss> plush couches and a high ceiling with hanging decors to attract your eyes . <sssss> you know what else attracts your eyes ? <sssss> go to the men 's room -- you 'll see what i mean . <sssss> we ordered some appetizers and bruschettas and boy were they yummy ! <sssss> meatballs were decent and so were the white shrimp . <sssss> the best was the carpacio ! <sssss> it literally melts on your palate . <sssss> the bruschettas rivals the best in phx ! <sssss> they do n't crumble when you take a bite and all the toppings stay aboard while you savor the moment . <sssss> mmmm ... ! <sssss> our service was great since there were only 2 in the party plus only a couple of tables . <sssss> i gather this place is popping during the weekends . <sssss> according to the bartender ; the closest thing to a vegas nightclub . <sssss> hmm , debauchery and immorality ! <sssss> - enjoy !
?		i ca n't say i 'm a big fan of buffets . <sssss> i can never eat enough to make it worth while . <sssss> seriously , how can you keep stuffing your face after an hour ! <sssss> however , i enjoyed my visit to this buffet . <sssss> nice sunday dinner gathering with the family . <sssss> i was impressed with some of the exotic varieties . <sssss> frog legs , beef tendon , octopus , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> i feel like andrew zimmerman ! <sssss> bizarre foods with bao hoang : -rrb- aside from the exotic ingredients the food from the buffet was n't bad at all . <sssss> sushi seemed `` fresh '' ... plus , coronas and bud lights for $ 1 with food ... man i 'm coming here just for the drinks ! <sssss> i like their decor since i am asian i dig asian art . <sssss> they definitely added an extra flare to make the place pop - totally dig the decor surrounding the sushi bar . <sssss> - enjoy !
?		lunch at cibo . <sssss> we sat outside on a cool early december day and i must say that cibo has the best atmosphere of any outside dining establishment in downtown phoenix . <sssss> the pizza is n't as good as pizzaria bianco -lrb- pb -rrb- but i 'm more likely to return to cibo over pb due to the outside atmosphere . <sssss> if you want to skip the pizza go for it , but do n't skip the nutella crepe . <sssss> service was on the slow side , but i would say normal for any restaurant serving tables outside . <sssss> i think it stems from how far the servers have to go from the kitchen and bar to outside . <sssss> i will return .
?		this upstairs patio is 3 stars and the dining room is 5 stars . <sssss> service on the upstairs patio is slow , but the view was nice . <sssss> in addition , i did n't get a refill on my coffee due to i 'm guessing the distance the server would have had to go to get it for me . <sssss> the grilled cheese and tomato soup was above par . <sssss> the wedge salad was delicious , the pizza also delicious . <sssss> i have n't had drinks here yet , but i 'm sure they 're fine . <sssss> service inside the dining room was considerably better than the upstairs patio .
?		it 's a good gym . <sssss> the staff is nothing but nice to me and my guests . <sssss> they remember my name and i would recommend the gym to anyone . <sssss> i also like that the showers have doors that lock as opposed to curtains . <sssss> i would agree with some of the other reviews in regards to the 40 dollar -lrb- price guarantee -rrb- b.s. fee . <sssss> that explains the 4 over 5 star review .
?		i considered lying and stating in my review that the dogs were awful solely to reduce the number of people waiting in line for them , but i realized that would be extremely selfish . <sssss> i am astounded that the hot dog i ate was as good as it was . <sssss> everyone should try one of these dogs .
?		worth a visit . <sssss> the food is solid , the atmosphere interesting , the prices surprisingly cheap . <sssss> mimosas and bloody marys -lrb- big ones -rrb- for 3 bucks . <sssss> that 's what i 'm talking about . <sssss> i 've eaten here twice and both times the service was good . <sssss> i will return .
?		solid diner style breakfast place . <sssss> the food is nothing special , but it 's always up to par . <sssss> the price is reasonable as well , and they always seem relatively clean .
?		tuck shop you 've got nothing on lo lo 's chicken and waffles . <sssss> i wanted to love your chicken and waffles , but it was too weird . <sssss> cheese in the waffle ? <sssss> the pork tenderloin saved the day for us . <sssss> it is well worth returning solely for that dish . <sssss> the atmosphere is great , the service was par , the price was reasonable . <sssss> i would recommend this establishment to others and i will return . <sssss> -lrb- for the pork tenderloin -rrb-
?		the cheese selection is very large and reasonably priced for the kinds of cheese available . <sssss> that is not to say that duck and decanter is cheap . <sssss> i prefer the staff at the north central location over this location . <sssss> duck and decanter almost has a monopoly on unique cheeses , coffees , teas , etcs . <sssss> the only other real option is aj 's and the prices there are exorbitant .
?		they burned the espresso beans in my cappuccino . <sssss> it 's a coffee shop right ? <sssss> they should make good coffee and espresso drinks . <sssss> if you ca n't do a cappuccino right you have no business being in the coffee business . <sssss> in addition , it took forever to get my bagel and cream cheese -lrb- over 15min -rrb- . <sssss> a wednesday at 10am is hardly an overly busy time . <sssss> am i wrong to expect prompt efficient and quality service from a coffee house . <sssss> i had three sips of the cappuccino and pitched it . <sssss> the bagel was fine , but its not as though they are baking them in the back . <sssss> save your money and go to lux or even starbucks for that matter .
?		i just had a cookie . <sssss> it was the equivalent to recieving oral sex . <sssss> i apologize , in advance , for my rather obscene remark , but these cookies are that ` effing good . <sssss> i supported it by buying 5 cookies . <sssss> i went back insideafter eating my first to tell the owner it was the best i ever had . <sssss> it is not my fault that this place can bake orgasms into cookies . <sssss> i too would like a world where there were cookie stores on every block . <sssss> particularly urban cookies . <sssss> i 'm happy .
?		shivers . <sssss> i got the fa-reaking shivers eating here , it was so good . <sssss> clean , delicious , original , simple - fucking awesome . <sssss> whats a macaron ? <sssss> it 's an edible version of megan fox , that 's what it is . <sssss> shut it , buy one and trust me .
?		3.5 stars . <sssss> food = very good service = not bad , though it took 20 minutes to get the check after we were done . <sssss> he apologized . <sssss> drink -lrb- singular -rrb- = amaretto sour at metro b. = not made with amaretto but cost = $ 12.00 usd . <sssss> i drew a picture of one dude plowing another dudes ass on the bill to show my displeasure . <sssss> i 'll pay 12.00 a drink for a fine bordeaux , or something huge and colorful that 's to be drunk from a monkey 's skull . <sssss> not a lowboy filled with amaretto substitute and cherry juice . <sssss> metro b , get your shit together .
?		i 'd say a solid 2.5 stars , if that was an option . <sssss> the restaurant was neat looking , i really liked the atmosphere and decor , and found the service to be awesome . <sssss> it 's just that the food was so unbelievably meh . <sssss> c'mon ! <sssss> with competition like `` the parlor '' and `` pizzeria bianco '' you 'd think they be cranking out some really tasty pies . <sssss> we had the pear - gorgonzola and the egg pizza . <sssss> lemmie tell ya , i shoulda been weeping with flavor-gasm after eating such tasty titles . <sssss> i have pizza blue-balls instead . <sssss> , ftl . <sssss> i would n't say no if someone wanted to buy me dinner here again , but i certainly would n't volunteer my soon to be unemployment check dollars here either .
?		omg , i am delirious . <sssss> this event was right up my alley , all the sweetness and carbs necessary to put me on a comma . <sssss> lgo went all out and provided full size items . <sssss> the cookies were gigantic . <sssss> since my hubby was sent away on business , i asked my friend maryanne to come with me . <sssss> i am so glad , because we shared the items we sampled . <sssss> i could n't possibly sample as much . <sssss> i loved one of the cakes that had the peaches on top , so moist and delicious . <sssss> the cookies were great , but what amazed us the most was the home made english muffins , omg , they are so delicious . <sssss> my friend ended up buying some to take home to her family . <sssss> the gelato sampling was awesome , i loved , loved , loved the peach sorbetto , so refreshing . <sssss> the mint , chocolate chip was great , also . <sssss> i could taste the fresh specs of mint . <sssss> my friend gave me a great idea for the twins birthday . <sssss> i am going to have lgo cater an ice cream social for us . <sssss> hopefully they can make the cookies a little smaller . <sssss> they can make any flavor ice cream you want as long as you order at least a gallon , which is going to be easy , most of my twins ' guests come in pairs , so the number is pretty high . <sssss> thank you , lindsey for setting this amazing event up and of course all the people from lgo who were so gracious and informative .
?		i am disappointed . <sssss> i wanted to like this place . <sssss> my husband and i decided to give this place a try . <sssss> big mistake . <sssss> what a waste of a `` date night '' . <sssss> it was very busy , so we decided to sit at the bar . <sssss> not a minute after we sat down one of the girls behind the bar broke a glass and shards flew in our direction . <sssss> my husband was hit in the face and even pieces of glass were in his hair . <sssss> what did this girl do ? <sssss> nothing , lifted her head and asked `` did i hit you ? '' <sssss> my response was , `` i think you can see glass all over his hair and in front of him '' . <sssss> under her breath she said `` sorry '' and turned around to take care of other people . <sssss> i asked someone else at the bar if this is the way they welcome their patrons , because i might be missing something . <sssss> eventually one of the managers came and apologized and bought us a round of drinks . <sssss> the sushi is not great , is your typical load of mayonnaise to mask everything . <sssss> there are better places for sushi .
?		i have been coming here for a few years , it is not my first choice . <sssss> it seems we always have a birthday or someone else 's get together , the food and service is good , however for my personal taste it is not something memorable .
?		not very impressed with this place . <sssss> the food was ok but nothing i would go back for . <sssss> if my friends want to meet there again , i might go . <sssss> i did n't care for my chicken chopped salad . <sssss> i had time that afternoon , so i did n't mind the service being slow . <sssss> my friend and i had n't seen each other in a couple of weeks so we were catching up . <sssss> the location is very nice .
?		this is an outdoors person 's heaven . <sssss> that is not me , but i can appreciate it . <sssss> i came here because they had a killer deal on keen shoes for the kids . <sssss> we love those shoes , but paying $ 50 a piece can bite , so when they were 50 % off , i got 2 pairs for each kid .
?		what a fabulous place . <sssss> we had a blast last night and we ca n't wait to come back with the twins .
?		this location has it down ! <sssss> they know how to handle families with kids . <sssss> we come here about once every ten days . <sssss> they are very fast and always bring the kids food first , which makes for a more relaxed time -lrb- if you can relax with two year olds -rrb- . <sssss> the twins love the chicken nuggets and last time they had sundaes for the first time ! <sssss> my little boy grabbed the cup and chugged the last drops down . <sssss> we 've been to other locations , however this one has the best service and my husband thinks the best and strongest margaritas -lrb- hey , daddy needs a margarita , too -rrb-
?		i enjoy this place . <sssss> i usually go at night with a group of moms and we love it . <sssss> the food is very good . <sssss> i finally tasted the evil jungle princess beef that my friend raved about . <sssss> it was really delicious . <sssss> i love the black orchid ahi tuna . <sssss> i went for lunch with my husband and we had a great time . <sssss> the bartender , paul is great . <sssss> my husband 's house margarita was really good . <sssss> the prices are so reasonable . <sssss> i ca n't wait for my next moms night out .
?		what a pity , i thought we had found a new spot for happy hour . <sssss> after reading the reviews , i was very excited to try this spot . <sssss> even though my husband wanted to go to the cove i convinced him to try a new spot . <sssss> the place is nice but the food was just good . <sssss> we tried the green chili pork and the lobster tacos . <sssss> i liked the lobster tacos , but the green chili pork was bland and i know bland , i have tasted the baby food i used to give my twins when they were smaller . <sssss> the wine choices are very few and the ones for hh are not good at all . <sssss> i tried the pinot noir and it was awful so i settled for the cabernet . <sssss> we decided to have dessert , we chose the chocolate cake with flan . <sssss> not good at all . <sssss> the flan portion was overcooked and so dry . <sssss> andrea the bartender was nice enough to notice and take it off our bill .
?		this was our third time at fez and i was debating whether to give it a 4 , due to our last experience , but the sweet potato fries alone deserve the 5 . <sssss> i think it was a little hectic this past saturday , so i am going to overlook the service . <sssss> my husband had the tangiers burger , it was awesome . <sssss> i had the phyllo chicken pockets , yummy . <sssss> our friends had the fez burger . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come for lunch and have my own burger . <sssss> we love the ambiance and how cool this place is . <sssss> it is such a pity that we have to drive so far to find gems . <sssss> phoenix has some awesome restaurants !
?		thank you fellow yelpers , this place is fantastic . <sssss> i have been wanting to come and check it out for a while . <sssss> this place is definitely worth the 52 mile round trip drive . <sssss> i had the carne asada burrito . <sssss> i had read so much about it i was salivating while my order was getting ready . <sssss> my hubby had one carne asada taco and one barbacoa . <sssss> both were delicious , too . <sssss> we also ordered the guacamole , excellent . <sssss> this place is a little gem . <sssss> ca n't wait co come back , i will try the fish platter another diner was having , it looked really good .
?		wow , wow , wow . <sssss> my hubby and i have been wanting to come to breadfruit for a while . <sssss> my hubby has been to jamaica and all over the caribbean kiteboarding so he loves the cuisine . <sssss> we decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this saturday . <sssss> we did n't have a reservation , but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders . <sssss> tony and beth were so nice and efficient . <sssss> tony just moved from portland in november , so we had a nice conversation with him about the area -lrb- we spend summers in or -rrb- . <sssss> i had a mojito , wow , the best mojito i have had in the valley , probably ever . <sssss> my hubby had the caipirinha . <sssss> it was so good . <sssss> we thought we would have one appetizer and leave . <sssss> so we ordered the scallops , then the plantain and avocado spring rolls . <sssss> they were so delicious . <sssss> the scallops were spicy , it was like fireworks in my mouth , in a good way . <sssss> i loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls . <sssss> my hubby wanted the soup of the day , the pumpkin and sweet potato soup . <sssss> i ended up eating most of it . <sssss> since i was dd , the hubby had another drink , this time the kingston rum punch , wow , that was strong but tasty . <sssss> tony recommended the rum glazed prawns and roti flatbread , double wow . <sssss> my hubby had a pina colada to wash that down . <sssss> that was the best pc i 've had . <sssss> not the blended coco lopez type . <sssss> for dessert we had their bread pudding . <sssss> this was the only thing i was not that crazy about , do n't get me wrong , i still ate it . <sssss> i am just used to the new orleans type of bread pudding , more gooey . <sssss> the experience at rum bar was so great we ca n't wait to come back and bring friends .
?		my hubby and i went to the uye set up by liz s. last sunday . <sssss> we had a really great time . <sssss> the buffet was very good . <sssss> i am a fan of yellow curry . <sssss> i wish it was not tofu , though . <sssss> i had a taste of everything . <sssss> the only thing i skipped was the donut hole thingys . <sssss> i am being adventurous with beers also , so i asked them to suggest one , i had the chang . <sssss> it was perfect with my meal . <sssss> this is such a reasonable place , you can enjoy your meal , watch the game , yes , they had the game on tv , have a beer and relax . <sssss> the buffet was only $ 9.50 . <sssss> thanks liz , for setting this up , we got to experience a great place .
?		i really liked this place , i have never thought of coming here to shop , but after all i am a mallrat , love malls . <sssss> i know , so 90s . <sssss> i had an appointment in chandler , so i did n't know how long if would take me to get there , so i decided to leave early . <sssss> well at that time of day and with no traffic , chandler was not that far . <sssss> so i had about an hour and a half to kill so i headed to the mall , thank you gps . <sssss> this place is huge , in an hour an a half i barely checked one section . <sssss> i want to go back to see what else is there . <sssss> looks really clean and spacious . <sssss> ca n't wait to be back . <sssss> i guess i need to have another blonde moment and make an appointment somewhere in chandler .
?		i am a little disappointed , i drove all the way to essence to try the macarons . <sssss> i have been to france several times , and being a pastry and sweets lover , i would stop by several patisseries and stock up with goodies for my train ride . <sssss> the macarons at essence seem a little too chewy , maybe because they have so much sugar . <sssss> a macaron is basically eggs whites , ground almonds and sugar . <sssss> if there is too much sugar , it is not going to be as crispy and flaky . <sssss> they also seem to have too much cream in the middle . <sssss> i had the caramel and the vanilla . <sssss> my husband had the chocolate and the mocha . <sssss> from the 4 choices , vanilla was by far the best . <sssss> the chocolate was go sticky and chewy , even my husband could n't finish it , and he does n't usually leave a dessert . <sssss> maybe this is good for my waist line .
?		great staff and wonderful food , this place hits the spot .
?		i was hoping for more out of this place : -lrb- i do n't think i will be returning for a round 2 . <sssss> place could work on its service a little .
?		best pho hands down , boba bar has a good selection . <sssss> very clean too !
?		fun neighborhood bar , with a new backroom filled with fun games such as skeeball !
?		love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing ! <sssss> the bartender cj is da bomb !
?		i went here today for a belated mother 's day lunch and loved every minute of it . <sssss> my mom ordered the egg white frittata with a side of potatoes and i ordered the rice bowl and added chicken . <sssss> the ambiance is very warm and inviting , it reminded me a lot like portland -lrb- my old hood -rrb- . <sssss> the servers were very friendly and helpful . <sssss> i will definitely be back for breakfast , lunch , dinner , coffee , and desert .
?		so yummy ! <sssss> my favorite cookies are the dark chocolate with walnuts . <sssss> it is a good thing that they are a tad pricey otherwise i would spend my lunch money on cookies everyday : -rrb-
?		not sure where you 'd find a better street taco in phoenix . <sssss> the al pastor is awesome , as is the fish , and the shrimp . <sssss> i did n't try the carne asada , but athena says its great . <sssss> they were out of chorizo . <sssss> dammit . <sssss> note : many other patrons had to study the menu when they were informed of the chorizo outage . <sssss> apparently it 's a fave and a `` go-to '' item . <sssss> i went with my usual number of 6 street tacos . <sssss> athena had 3 with black beans - which were creamy and dee-lish . <sssss> that 's about the right way to do it for us , although others opted for 10 tacos or 2-3 tacos and a burrito . <sssss> one lady -lrb- seemingly a regular -rrb- went directly for some type of tostada . <sssss> seems you ca n't go wrong however you do it . <sssss> everyone there went with the mexican cokes , except for one guy that had a diet coke . <sssss> whatevs . <sssss> i did n't ask about the $ 7 toasted tortilla . <sssss> although , as one of the most expensive items on the menu - we were curious . <sssss> it cant just be a tortilla can it ? <sssss> historical note : some of you may recall this place used to be the best place for a great chicago dog ... mr. mort 's , until he retired long ago . <sssss> i miss that place , but this is a great replacement ! <sssss> traffic note : the light rail construction makes this place a bit tricky to get into , but not too bad . <sssss> vacation note : if you are reading this between july 2-9th , 2013 : it 'll be closed for their vacation !
?		just a quick update . <sssss> i 've been here numerous times now , and everything is always great . <sssss> clean , friendly , efficient staff . <sssss> picture and sound quality remain excellent .
?		they brew a decent beer . <sssss> last time i was there i tried some crazy-high ibu ipa , or dipa from the cask - which was quite smooth and an excellent brunch beer despite the amount of hops . <sssss> the food is fairly standard brew-pub fare . <sssss> you can get shrimp sliders , burgers ... that kind of thing . <sssss> as for their website - u can click on that link above , but it wo n't do you much good . <sssss> they do n't seem to update it ever - so its useless to see what they might have on cask , or the current seasonal . <sssss> and that menu link ? <sssss> circa prior-to-the-name-change from sonoran brewhouse , so you ca n't rely on that .
?		yum , this place was great . <sssss> went with a party of 5 on this past first friday 's and only waiting about 10-15 minutes . <sssss> not too bad at all ! <sssss> services was excellent . <sssss> i loved their wine list . <sssss> we each ordered a different pizza , so i was able to try 5 different kinds . <sssss> i like the quattro cheese one the most . <sssss> it was delicious . <sssss> i will definitely return once i 've checked out some other pizza this town has to offer . <sssss> two thumbs up !
?		i 'm new to sushi and when we met up with a couple of friends on a tuesday night , i 'm glad i did . <sssss> i had the opportunity to try 5 or 6 different kinds and i liked them all . <sssss> when i go back i 'll be getting the golden state roll , it was delicious ! <sssss> ca n't wait to go again .
?		bev mo is a great place to pick up most of your alcohol needs . <sssss> why only three stars ? <sssss> with the idea of an inclusive liquor store , i had hoped it would be easy to find a few of my favorites . <sssss> i 've tried to find some guatemalan beer and some miller chill in cans and have so far been unsuccessful . <sssss> i have however looked up the miller chills on their website and they are there ! <sssss> none of the guatemalan . <sssss> . <sssss> i also looked for tripel karmeleit but not there . <sssss> aside from that , it has pretty much whatever you need . <sssss> there is an impressive selection of bottled soda . <sssss> i am looking forward to going back just for that reason . <sssss> and to brows through some wine and beer .
?		i really liked this one . <sssss> now , granted , i went to a night game , and it was really windy , so i had the entertainment of seeing tons of garbage and other stuff get whisped onto the field . <sssss> it was pretty funny ! <sssss> i sat in the bleachers close to the away team dugout -lrb- cubs ... were the away team : -rrb- -rrb- i had a good time . <sssss> i did n't like that the bathrooms were so seperated and i do remember not being too many stalls , so the wait was pretty horrible , but beside from that , a great stadium . <sssss> i love that you are close enough to some other fine establishments to enjoy some food and drink before the game , and still be able to walk to the park .
?		the absurdly delicious burgers here do well to reconcile the awkward , uncomfortable seating . <sssss> prior to actually masticating your foodstuffs though , the anticipation makes you all the more cognizant of the random strangers ' elbows bumping yours . <sssss> i have n't had much luck with delux drinks ; fortunately my mouth was so busy orgasming after sweet potato fries , i did n't have much time to ruminate over my shitty lemon drop martini . <sssss> after the fact of course , i decided that the drink tasted like a melted safeway-brand lemonade popsicle with a hint of rubbing alcohol . <sssss> i should have gone with any one of the awesome beers offered . <sssss> the service makes me feel slightly unwelcome and a bit in the way . <sssss> the central seating is a prime spot to get jostled by the clipped paces of busy servers . <sssss> sometimes they apologize ; other times , they 're probably so used to running over everything in their path , that they do n't even notice when they 've accosted you . <sssss> but god , those fucking burgers . <sssss> when all is said and done , the burgers make the bruises all better .
?		bookman 's is the ultimate sanctuary for add-addled adults with an uncanny ability to justify purchasing magazine back-issues in bulk . <sssss> no joke - this place caters to my easily-overwhelmed sensibilities and makes me feel like i need to own tattered joycean hardbacks just to lend my apartment the smell of ancient books . <sssss> it 's like park and swap jr. - there is pretty much the grandest selection of old junk , mixed with new junk , mixed with questionably-useless junk . <sssss> all of this proverbial junk , though , seems completely necessary . <sssss> the staff rules , and the credit there never expires so you can trade in your unwanted garbage for some in-store points and maybe buy yourself a gamecube or some elementary teach yourself japanese texts . <sssss> in any case , if you leave bookman 's without a claw full of relics , you have way too much self-control .
?		the existence of red hot robot really cuts down on my monthly vinyl-and-plush shipping costs . <sssss> it 's a huge bummer for me that phoenix does n't offer more specialty shops like this , but for what it is , it 's pretty amazing . <sssss> quaint , minimalist setup ; all the toys are easily accessible , the owner is amicable , and quietly regards you as you shop , ready to field questions without getting in your way . <sssss> not a huge selection , but i 've been spoiled by larger shops with a greater local following in ca . <sssss> you ca n't really knock rhr for not having as big a base out here - taking into account its location , this shop is pretty excellent . <sssss> it 's organized , well-maintained and does n't threaten to hyperventilate you like kid robot in sf .
?		we came here to celebrate my friend 's birthday . <sssss> personally we did n't try any of the food because we had eaten earlier . <sssss> the servers were nice , but my best friend 's husband complained that the drink he ordered was terrible -lrb- it was , we all took a sip ; it tasted like cough syrup -rrb- but the server did n't really didnt seem surprised or remove the drink until my friend 's husband gave it to her . <sssss> also through the process of serving all the sushi dishes they could n't remember who had which ones , and which was which ; there was a few minutes of confusion . <sssss> we 're not supposed to know which sushi is which , the servers are . <sssss> there also was some inconsistencies with the wasabi . <sssss> some were so mild you could barely taste anything , while the others were so spicy that it brought tears to your eyes . <sssss> no one made complaints on any of the sushi itself . <sssss> however based on what i saw , i know i 've had way better . <sssss> we also took a look at the menu , and their prices are outrageous . <sssss> i truly think ra is more of a trendy thing , like starbucks ... people just seem to go here because of the name . <sssss> we 'll just stick to our regular place for sushi .
?		we 've gone here quite a few times and every time its great ! <sssss> my boyfriend loves the beer and we always get burgers because they 're just that good . <sssss> prices are moderate ; roughly $ 11.00 per person for food , throw in a few more dollars for a beer . <sssss> it can be pretty loud on a weekend night but hey , its not only a bar , its brewery ! <sssss> atmosphere is fun and service is always friendly .
?		this morning we decided to give this place a try after reading the positive yelp reviews . <sssss> our experience was ... okay . <sssss> nothing horrible but nothing great either . <sssss> i got the traditional eggs benedict and my boyfriend got the irish eggs benedict . <sssss> it was good , a little lacking in flavor but okay . <sssss> the potatoes , however , were extremely bland and lacking of any seasoning . <sssss> i needed to add salt and pepper to my entire meal , which came from these dirty looking tin cans sitting on the table . <sssss> i noticed the portion of potatoes they gave us was extremely small , i felt gypped ! <sssss> i almost said something but decided not to make a fuss over it . <sssss> the waitress brought us a glass jar filled with ketchup for the potatoes ... i did n't like this at all . <sssss> the jar had some dried ketchup on the underneath side of the glass lid and it just looked greasy on the outside with finger prints all over it . <sssss> it just bothered me . <sssss> i know they 're trying to be cute and unique but really just leave it in the original ketchup bottle . <sssss> also this is n't a large eatery , with only about 10 tables . <sssss> the size does n't exactly bother me but when you have a baby at the next table screaming , the entire room gets tense , you can actually feel it . <sssss> but it 's not the size of the room its how they use the space . <sssss> the farm house in gilbert is also a very small space but it is extremely warm and inviting , mark 's cafe lacks this . <sssss> fyi , if you have n't tried the farmhouse off of gilbert just south of guadalupe , please do , it 's incredible , but get there before 8am or you 'll be waiting in a line that goes around the building ! <sssss> wonderful place ! <sssss> just a side note if the owners ever read their yelp reviews . <sssss> we noticed they were playing religious music , which did n't bother us even though we 're not religious , but for the sake of respecting everyone who comes into your place of business it would be a good idea to be neutral so you do n't lose customers . <sssss> all in all this place was mediocre at best . <sssss> i definitely felt it was over priced for what you get . <sssss> service was fast and friendly so that was a plus . <sssss> however , knowing that i can get better quality , better tasting food , with cheaper prices elsewhere has me thinking we may not be back . <sssss> we often go to crackers cafe on elliot and priest which is excellent . <sssss> we 've been there over a dozen times and every time it 's a win . <sssss> wonderful food , great environment , friendly staff , and prices that make you feel like you 're getting a great deal . <sssss> mark 's cafe is over priced with a lack of comfort in their decor and food .
?		we went here last night for the first time and really liked it ! <sssss> my boyfriend got the orange chicken , and i had the walnut shrimp . <sssss> both meals were very flavorful , cooked well , were great portions , and also reheated nicely the next day . <sssss> for some reason i really liked their fortune cookies too . <sssss> i know it sounds like an odd thing to mention but i did ! <sssss> i usually never eat them but their fortune cookies had a homemade taste to them ! <sssss> we will absolutely be going back !
?		ahhh-mazing !!! <sssss> i do n't want to make this a lengthy review so here 's just a few things . <sssss> the atmosphere was wonderful . <sssss> it was trendy with it 's wooden accents , lit candles , and stark white linens . <sssss> the service was outstanding . <sssss> could n't have asked for a more knowledgeable and sincere guy . <sssss> even when someone in our party ordered something that is normally sent back he let her know , and then gave her another option that would go with the tastes she was looking for . <sssss> he was wonderful at pairing the perfect wines with our food . <sssss> the food was out of this world . <sssss> we shared the chopped salad -lrb- which has it 's own facebook page , lol -rrb- . <sssss> it was hands down the best salad i 've ever eaten , and i 'm not a salad person . <sssss> we both ordered the filet mignon which came with some greens and smashed potatoes . <sssss> i 've have never had a more tender and juicy filet in my life . <sssss> it was absolutely fantastic ! <sssss> hats off to the chef ! <sssss> please know this place is quite pricey so be prepared for that . <sssss> our salad , two filets , and his two beers came to about $ 93 but it was so amazingly worth the splurge .
?		update !!! <sssss> lowering my review to 1 star , i 'd give zero stars if i could . <sssss> i explained in my first review how i purchased a gift certificate through my work 's discount program for employees and a newly changed policy is to no longer charge the 18 % gratuity . <sssss> however when i came to atl wings on friday they forced me to pay that gratuity . <sssss> my work contacted them about illegally charging me and atl wings actually gave push back ! <sssss> now keep in mind the company i work for is not some tiny little nothing business ; it 's the largest corporation in the world for it 's industry and atl wings is so arrogant they think this may not effect them . <sssss> let me tell you atl wings , in my building alone , i work with nearly 2000 people , who most of which reside in mesa , gilbert , and chandler ; word of mouth is a very powerful tool . <sssss> this restaurant is now being reported to www.restaurant.com to be taken off of the program for employees to purcahse gift certificates ! <sssss> clearly they have no respect for their customers . <sssss> they only want as many dollars as they can get , even if this means going against contracts they sign with other companies and ignoring policies that are given .
?		amazing food !! <sssss> is it me , or has this place gotten even better lately ?? <sssss> they even have a separate gluten free vegan menu , which is helpful . <sssss> looove the chili fries and the buffalo wings . <sssss> favorites include anything with their chicken in it ... the sweet and sour chicken is to die for . <sssss> love that this place is next to nami . <sssss> it 's perfect ... get our yums on here and then head to nami for dessert . <sssss> the brunch is very good here as well . <sssss> have i mentioned the buffalo wings ? <sssss> oh myyyyy .
?		about the only thing i can eat is the potatoes . <sssss> that said , i 've tried other there while `` cheating '' like their omelettes . <sssss> i am not impressed . <sssss> how can anyone be impressed with processed cheese and greasy gobs of hash browns ??? <sssss> ick . <sssss> next time , i 'm lobbying for waffle house . <sssss> plus , the last time i was there , i was recovering from surgery and in a wheelchair . <sssss> the person at the front taking names and seating people was downright rude . <sssss> yes , she was young and ignorant , but she still acted badly .
?		tasty black beans and veggie burritos . <sssss> good to-go vegetarian burritos ! <sssss> a rarity here in phx .
?		i think you can always tell the quality of a thai restaurant by how good their pad thai is ! <sssss> this place has yummy pad thai !!!!! <sssss> very friendly and very accommodating !
?		indian comfort food and grocery . <sssss> dinner -lrb- in the restaurant section of this building -rrb- is served traditionally with several other dishes to on your tray to balance the palate . <sssss> everything is made fresh right as you order it ... the vegetables chopped , the dishes spiced . <sssss> cheap price for so much food including dessert ! <sssss> soooo delicious !! <sssss> long vegetarian menu . <sssss> two tvs in the place play bollywood movies and videos . <sssss> funzies !
?		my favorite is the thai pizza sans chicken . <sssss> wow . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> anyone that puts bean sprouts on their pizza and can pull it off with flair and taste has to be given kudos ! <sssss> great veggie pizza by the slice ... there 's always one meat , one veg , and cheese ... perfect ! <sssss> cozy spot to have a beer and grab a slice . <sssss> plus , they usually have a special for two slices and a beer ... so even better !
?		location location location . <sssss> i almost felt like i was back in europe sitting outside at cheuvront ... right along central and watching the lightrail whiz by , people walking along the sidewalks and the overall hustle of ` city ' life . <sssss> the inside , however , lacked a certain intimacy that i like to see in wine bars . <sssss> it is quite casual and airy ... not cozy with low lighting like i was expecting/hoping for . <sssss> it was quite busy for an early evening -lrb- probably because their happy hour is great and otherwise its a bit pricey -rrb- . <sssss> the parking lot was full so i gambled with potentially being towed and parked along a side street a few blocks down . <sssss> the waiters were excellent at recommending different wines and letting us sample a few before deciding . <sssss> i settled on santa ema merlot , which was really fantastic ! <sssss> you could spend hours pouring over the varied cheeses and wines cheuvront offers -lrb- even have a special retail section inside devoted to cheese and wine -rrb- . <sssss> besides the great atmosphere outside , there are other wine bars that i would prefer to go to -lrb- 5th and wine , rokerij , bomberos -rrb- . <sssss> however , if you are in cenpho and looking for a good glass of wine it is definitely worth stopping by .
?		t cooks is my favorite happy hour in the area . <sssss> for reals . <sssss> i want to go there right now . <sssss> my boyfriend and i somewhat arrived on accident one night , only to realize that i have been missing the best happy hour ever ! <sssss> we have been back many times since , and i try to recommend it to all my girlfriends . <sssss> its part of the palm hotel , so obviously its beautiful , elegant , comfortable and more . <sssss> they have a lovely inside bar and live music sometimes too . <sssss> but my favorite spot to sit is the beautiful outside patio , especially now , as the weather here is amazing . <sssss> so they have super fancy smancy cocktail list , which is all 50 % off during happy hour . <sssss> they also have awesome discounted appetizers . <sssss> we had the pretzel bites with cheese and grilled brie . <sssss> but the best night to go is monday night for mustache monday . <sssss> they have even more discounted cocktails with names like `` the ron burgundy and fu-manchu '' . <sssss> also - fake mustaches . <sssss> so fun ! <sssss> connie is awesome , she is super cute and has been our server a few times now . <sssss> always spot on with recommendations and even comped us a few drinks when the service was slow . <sssss> little did she know that i love t cooks despite anything !
?		i do n't usually write 1 stars but moira does deserve this one . <sssss> my boyfriend and i went in last night for reverse happy hour , as i have wanted to check out moira for some time . <sssss> we walked in and immediately the hostess said ` be right back ' and left us awkwardly standing in the entrance for a good 5 minutes . <sssss> we were already thinking about leaving but were finally seated and each ordered a sultry saki from the cocktail menu . <sssss> after about 15 minutes without our drink , we were again seriously pondering just leaving . <sssss> i do understand when places are busy or short staffed . <sssss> this really did n't seem to be the case at all . <sssss> plenty of tables empty and a good amount of waitstaff in sight . <sssss> finally our drink came and it was the weakest , worst , watery drink i have ever had . <sssss> when the ice melted in the drink , it still tasted the same . <sssss> huge waste of $ 6 . <sssss> the worst part of the evening came at the end when i got our bill . <sssss> i noticed that our waiter overcharged us for the fried tofu , which is under the $ 3 menu column . <sssss> *** keep in mind that the happy hour menu is all black with white text . <sssss> however , the waiter was refusing to honor the $ 3 price because apparently in black pen on the black menu was a handwritten in $ 5 sign , that you could only see if you held your phone light over the menu . <sssss> i actually laughed and told him this is ridiculous and is n't going to happen . <sssss> finally he obliged and took of the $ 2 overcharge . <sssss> long story short , terrible drinks , terrible service and watch out of invisible amendments to the menu pricing .
?		i love dive bars and unlike many other dive bars , monkey pants is one with a younger crowd ... one where you will not be the only person without an aarp card in your wallet . <sssss> the bartender looked like the main male character from -lrb- 500 -rrb- days of summer . <sssss> great . <sssss> the drinks were cheap and strong . <sssss> even greater . <sssss> this is probably the reason that i even thought the bartender looked like a quasi joseph gordon-levitt . <sssss> hands down , the best part of the night is when its time for ` free shots if you take off your shirt ' . <sssss> ideally this is meant for the ladies of the bar . <sssss> the reality , however , is much more entertaining . <sssss> suddenly there are dozens of shirtless men -lrb- who really should n't be shirtless in any circumstance -rrb- parading around the bar . <sssss> anyone first walking into the establishment would think they 've entered a bad porno or some sort of explicit party . <sssss> its hilarious but unfortunately that image will be forever burned into my memory , regardless of how much alcohol was circulating throughout my nueral cavity . <sssss> i had to hold back one star only because the crowd is a bit to ` frat boy ' esque for my liking . <sssss> although it is par for the course being located on mill ave near asu campus .
?		i can not believe i have n't reviewed coach house yet . <sssss> this is truly my favorite bar and always my ` go-to ' spot . <sssss> great location in old town but without the typical scottsdale crowd . <sssss> lots of parking . <sssss> great bartenders . <sssss> cheap and strong drinks -lrb- best combination -rrb- . <sssss> moderately sanitary bathrooms . <sssss> crazy christmas lights and decorations . <sssss> if you are lucky enough to go around the holiday season ... it is literally like santa threw up all over coach house . <sssss> lights , wrapping paper , ornaments , candy canes , shitty christmas decorations up the ying yang . <sssss> its wonderful . <sssss> i would not want to be the guy having to put up/take down all that each year . <sssss> every single time i go to coach house , it is an awesome time . <sssss> always meet interesting people and have actually made a few friends from my encounters there . <sssss> the inside is fairly small with rickety tables but a great jukebox and arcade games . <sssss> large outdoor area to meander as well . <sssss> * best bar in old town *
?		one of the best restaurants i 've had the luxury of dining at in decades . <sssss> i could n't in good consciousness deny my worst enemy the opportunity to eat at such a wondrous venue . <sssss> the short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth finger-licking fantastic . <sssss> the signature cocktails are so fanciful they almost command you to lift your pinky as you dainfully sip your way into alcoholic bliss . <sssss> the oversized/giant lamps at every turn make you feel as if you are walking in a land of giants or that you have found yourself in a ` honey i shrunk the kids ' situation . <sssss> the cherry on top would have to be the free chocolate chip cookies upon your departure . <sssss> they soothe the restless ` fat kid ' inside of us all and make the terrible act of leaving cheslea 's kitchen a bit more bareable .
?		i 've been coming to good old da vang for 10 + years now . <sssss> i first stumbled upon this eatery when my high school friends -lsb- crap , did i just age myself ? <sssss> -rsb- took me here for lunch . <sssss> it was love at first bite ~ the food is cheap , plentiful , and extremely tasty . <sssss> while the parking lot is n't in the best shape and the restaurant itself is as alluring as a dumpy gas station , come for the food ! <sssss> just make sure you do n't need to use the restroom ... ick ! <sssss> service here is decent . <sssss> they always try to speak vietnamese to me even though i 'm not viet . <sssss> anyways , give this little hole-on-the-wall a try ! <sssss> the food definitely makes up for the lack of ambiance .
?		by far the best place for some chicken and waffles with a nice tall mason jar full of red kool-aid ! <sssss> while some may say the location is n't the best -lsb- okay , it can seem pretty sketchy after dusk -rsb- , the food is amazing ! <sssss> i usually get the betty boop -lsb- a waffle and a breast -rsb- and some mac & cheese if i 'm feeling extra hungry . <sssss> the waffle is always crisp and delicious and the fried chicken is delicious . <sssss> got ta love that savory-sweet combo of a syrup-y bite of waffle with a juicy bite of chicken . <sssss> * shivers * the service is always friendly and this place is usually packed . <sssss> lo-lo 's definitely lives up to all their hype -lsb- do n't go to the scottsdale location though . <sssss> totes not the same . <sssss> -rsb- ~ !
?		boston 's is kind of on the same level as applebee 's for me . <sssss> although boston 's food is a million times better , the atmosphere is kind of bland . <sssss> as for food , as i 've said , it 's pretty good but the portions are kinda small . <sssss> the pizza is okay . <sssss> i 'd rather go to nypd pizza . <sssss> at least the nachos are fine . <sssss> a plus about this place : happy hour is a steal . <sssss> cheap drinks , cheap food ... definitely worth trying !
?		when china king opened a few years back , the food was absolutely delicious ! <sssss> everything came piping hot , service was pro , and the food was always fresh . <sssss> these days , it seems like no matter what time you stop in , the food is always just reheated and never made to order . <sssss> i 've been to china king for dim sum and dinner and the food seems pretty inconsistent . <sssss> i think the previous chef must 've left because the food is pretty sub-par . <sssss> their prices are ridiculous for the quality you 're getting and service has steadily dwindled to the point where the waitress will burn you with the tea pot if you do n't move away fast enough -- never an apology , oh well ! <sssss> i just hate getting a steamer of dried siu mai and soggy shrimp dumplings . <sssss> nothing makes me more mad . <sssss> the overall decor is still decently clean and new but the ambiance is a bit bland ! <sssss> i say skip china king and head to a better eatery .
?		i first came to sushi 101 as a wide-eyed freshmen at asu back in the fall of 2003 -lsb- shh , i 'm still 21 , okay !? <sssss> -rsb- and have been back plenty of times since . <sssss> this is pretty much a staple place for all asu students to go to since it 's right across the street from campus . <sssss> anyways , on with the review ! <sssss> the decor and ambiance of the place is pretty chill . <sssss> the place is always busy and service is usually speedy . <sssss> try the stuffed jalapenos ; wash it down with lots of eel and salmon ; get some different bites of tuna in between ; order the obligatory asu and sun devil rolls ; never ever forget the soft shell crab ; and once you 've discreetly unbuttoned the top button of your skinny jeans and kicked your feet up into your friend 's lap , splurge and get some tempura ice cream because let 's face it : there 's always room for fried dessert . <sssss> while the quality is n't exactly the best and i would n't drive out of my way to stop in for a bite , i 'll always have a soft spot for sushi 101 and all the warm fuzzy -lsb- and drunken -rsb- memories attached to the place . <sssss> also , they have a great happy hour menu worth checking out and their lunch specials are decent .
?		i really love everything about this spot . <sssss> if i lived in scottsdale , i would be here everyday for happy hour . <sssss> the atmosphere is wonderful , like a generous patio at someone 's home . <sssss> it feels tucked away , although you are really off a pretty busy street . <sssss> there is also plenty of room inside when the heat is too much . <sssss> the service is attentive and the food is fresh and vibrant . <sssss> this is also a great place to just get drinks ...
?		do n't go here if you are trying to eat healthy ... too many temptations at every turn . <sssss> i had amazing scallops for dinner , but only after eating a ridiculous amount of bread . <sssss> the hamburgers in the bar looked and smelled incredible . <sssss> i like the spicy spin they put on most of the dishes ... mac and cheese is killer .
?		the tour was great and informative . <sssss> i loved imagining what life must have been like with so much creativity flowing . <sssss> my only issue is having to take the tour with a bunch of half wits who ca n't listen and are bent on doing the very things the facility has asked them not to do . <sssss> what the hell is wrong with people ?
?		cool spot to stop for a drink if you 're in the neighborhood . <sssss> this is definitely a place for cocktails , as opposed to other libations . <sssss> signature cocktails are the way to go -- i had a cucumber-mint martini , which was very good . <sssss> the ambiance is modern and slightly euro , and also very urban . <sssss> the absence of windows , dim lighting and backdoor entrance make sidebar feel exclusive . <sssss> there is no outdoor space , so this place might be a great option for hiding out on a hot summer night .
?		mondays and tuesdays at radio milano are `` neighborhood nights , '' meaning you can get a salad and an entree , or a dessert and an entree for $ 20 . <sssss> last night was my second experience at rm . <sssss> not only was the food superb , but i ca n't think of a single other place in this region or elsewhere where you can get a chopped salad and filet mignon for $ 20 . <sssss> everything was top-quality , including the service . <sssss> great food , great wine , cool ambiance -- perhaps my new favorite neighborhood restaurant .
?		one of the best new restaurants i 've been to in a while . <sssss> a converted 1940s-ish scottsdale home , this place has the best ambiance -- especially the outdoor patio . <sssss> the brisket appetizer is amazing . <sssss> i had the scallops for the entree and it was fantastic . <sssss> ca n't wait to return !
?		i go here for the cheap happy hour beers and the company . <sssss> i usually sit at the bar . <sssss> the seating has gotten better but when they put the backs on the chairs people would lean back and almost break them . <sssss> the cushions fabric on the chairs make you sweat badly and the concrete bar table will burn your arms in the summer and they are in the shade . <sssss> the food is good and cheap . <sssss> the bar waitress are good but sometimes you get that `` one '' who wo n't pay attention to you at all . <sssss> i think she is more concerned about popping out those fake boobs at everyone . <sssss> the parking is n't that great .
?		every time i go there it seems to be about the same great atmosphere . <sssss> excellent service , cheerful wait staff , clean restrooms , tables and the selection in live music is awesome . <sssss> i always recommend any of my friends to this place when we want to hang out , have a few drinks , eat or watch the bands . <sssss> only thing i would say is not that great is the parking . <sssss> it 's extremely tight and your car will get dinged .
?		all i wanted was a freaking awesome tasting burger and that is what i got ! <sssss> i also ordered the homemade potato chips and did not want to share it with anybody . <sssss> they tasted so good . <sssss> the service was awesome . <sssss> love the free peanuts and bread while you wait for your meal . <sssss> what a clever idea .
?		this place is pretty nice to visit for entertainment . <sssss> the seats are high and the arm rest retract . <sssss> there is plenty of leg room and low lighting so if you need to take a restroom break you can see the steps . <sssss> but this is where this place goes wrong . <sssss> only one centralized restroom so if your movie is in the back corner there is quite a walk . <sssss> the restroom needs better ventilation and constant upkeep during busy hours .
?		cute little shop ! <sssss> we ordered a bunch of cake pops for an office birthday party and they were a huge hit ! <sssss> thanks for making our celebration extra special . <sssss> i am looking forward to coming back and trying the cupcakes and other goodies .
?		we went there on a friday night with my whole family to celebrate my birthday . <sssss> no one in our group had ever been there before , so it was a treat to try out a new place ... but , also , sort of a gamble , because we were n't sure what to expect and we have quite a few picky eaters in the bunch . <sssss> to my surprise and pleasure , everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal ! <sssss> i got the luau pork sandwich , which the menu claims to be `` heaven on a bun '' and they were not lying ! <sssss> it was so delicious . <sssss> the boyfriend got the bali hai bbq ribs and the meat was literally falling off the bone . <sssss> it was perfectly cooked . <sssss> his only complaint was that the sweet potato fries were too sweet and did n't go with the ribs . <sssss> i think he would have preferred the wasabi mashed potatoes instead . <sssss> i wanted to order one of everything off the drink menu , because i could n't make up my mind . <sssss> everything sounded good ! <sssss> our waiter was so attentive . <sssss> he very discretely circled around his tables every few minutes or so to make sure everyone was taken care of , but he did n't interrupt the meal , unless , of course , you flagged him down for something . <sssss> it was a really great experience and i ca n't wait to go back there again !
?		service is often pretty crappy , but their food is good . <sssss> the gollo burro is one of their specialties , getting it `` green style '' is key . <sssss> my family and i ordered take out from there a couple weeks ago and they definitely skimped on the portions . <sssss> my bean burrito barely had anything to it and my side of rice was only a couple bites . <sssss> kind of frustrating . <sssss> usually bad service can be easily forgotten by good food and decent prices , but i think i will keep my trips to casa r to a minimum .
?		the food was fabulous . <sssss> the service and atmosphere were wonderful . <sssss> on a beautiful day like today , it was the perfect setting to sit out on the patio . <sssss> it is worth saving room for dessert . <sssss> i took half of my lunch home so that i could enjoy dessert . <sssss> yum !
?		i took my mom out to the olive mill for a visit when she visited from montana . <sssss> we really enjoyed our time . <sssss> we took the tour , had lunch and took some goodies home . <sssss> i 'm pretty sure that i ca n't live without their garlic flavored olive oil from now on . <sssss> it is so fresh and yummy . <sssss> i 'll definitely be going back or ordering online . <sssss> my visit felt reminiscent of my visits to wineries in sonoma/napa . <sssss> it was neat to have that feeling in arizona . <sssss> i love supporting local businesses just like this one .
?		the morning glory cafe is excellent . <sssss> my boyfriend took me here for the first time to meet some of his family , and i just fell in love . <sssss> i like the atmosphere and the food is hearty . <sssss> i scheduled a morning brunch with all of my girlfriends there a few weeks ago and it went off without a hitch . <sssss> the staff is great !
?		i love this place . <sssss> it has the perfect lunch portions , atmosphere and menu . <sssss> i think it would be hard to find a better place for lunch . <sssss> yum !
?		the setting reminds me of an upscale diner and every time i have been in it has been packed . <sssss> i usually opt to sit at the bar because the service is much faster . <sssss> last time i came in i had the veggie omelet , and while drowning in cheese it was still pretty good . <sssss> the accompanying toast was pre-buttered -lrb- i hate that -rrb- and the potatoes lacked flavor . <sssss> all in all this place is a pretty solid breakfast spot , if you are not expecting more than your average diner food .
?		i frequent this valle luna often because my grandmother loves it . <sssss> it has been one of her favorite restaurants for over 3 decades and what grammie wants grammie gets . <sssss> the gradual decline in the customer service has become painfully obvious over the years . <sssss> the food usually arrives in different intervals , and often before we get our silverware . <sssss> the tables are so close together you have to practically scream to hear your dining partners . <sssss> the salsa is flavorful yet has no spice , and the last cheese crisps we ordered were soggy and undercooked . <sssss> the silverware is disgusting , they 've obviously been using it for over 30 years . <sssss> we went last night and observed one of the most incompetent and rude hosts in history . <sssss> he was a smart ass teenage blond boy that kept pronouncing peoples names wrong . <sssss> i watched as he past over two separate groups due to the mispronunciations -lrb- can he not read his own writing ? <sssss> -rrb- i could n't take it anymore and hipped them to the situation , he responded with indignant rudeness instead of apologies . <sssss> luckily for him the group was half tanked from sitting in the bar so they waited to be seated before complaining . <sssss> now all this aside . <sssss> valle luna makes the best grilled pork chimichanga i have ever tasted . <sssss> hands down . <sssss> order it , gain 5 pounds , thank me later . <sssss> 5 star chimi , 1 star service , = 3 star review .
?		holy canolli this place is fantastic ! <sssss> how have i never been here before ? <sssss> the set up of the restaurant is very open and they piped in old school tunes , frank sinatra , harry james and tommy dorsey . <sssss> it really reminded me of artie bucco 's sister restaurant . <sssss> the service was excellent and the staff was friendly and hospitable . <sssss> we even heard the owner/chef yelling at the staff from the kitchen `` wize this fettuccine sitting owt heaar ! '' <sssss> it was classic . <sssss> he really showed a passion for both the guests and the food . <sssss> i had read a few yelp reviews before i chose this place and i can only mirror what everyone else said . <sssss> the italian bread and focaccia with red pepper olive oil and garlic butter are amazing . <sssss> the spaghetti and meatballs were to die for . <sssss> the meatballs literally melt in your mouth . <sssss> i want to go back and try everything on the menu . <sssss> spoiler alert - after the meal the owner came to our table and asked us to guess a number between 1 and 99 , you get the number and dinner is free . <sssss> we did n't win but it was a fun game and a nice way to end the meal . <sssss> i will be back - i am anxious to try lunch and the pizzas they are selling out the back !
?		switch is a standard three stars . <sssss> i love love love fez and do n't want to diss the sista ... but the food here is pretty bland . <sssss> they could definitely update their menu , at first it seems decent , then you realize the items are the same , just prepared in different ways . <sssss> . <sssss> each time i have been here the staff has been inattentive at best . <sssss> the hummus did not even come close to the deliciousness fez serves up . <sssss> the french dip was just ok -lrb- and came out cold -rrb- . <sssss> the gallette i tried was like a turkey pot pie , decent but nothing to rave about . <sssss> maybe it is not fair to compare to fez , maybe i had too high of expectations ... they do serve delicious sangria , and they have a great happy hour 2-4-1 caipirinhas and sangria -lrb- so rare to have sangria on happy hour these days -rrb- . <sssss> i will give switch another chance , maybe i just came on a few off nights . <sssss> .
?		why did i love this place so much ? <sssss> + free softserve icecream + loads of organic produce and bread + no high fructose corn syrup -lrb- unless you get a soda -rrb- + excellent spicey tortilla soup + quick , healthy and delicious + my bf got the potatoe and i could n't believe the monster ! <sssss> it was 4 lbs ! <sssss> it sounds like this place has improved since earlier reviews . <sssss> i would go back anytime for lunch , it was great . <sssss> and kids eat free on sunday 's -lrb- so avoid it like the plauge and go another day ; -rrb-
?		i had lunch here again the other day and i realize i was either very high or absolutely starving last time i ate here . <sssss> this visit i pretty much had the opposite experience . <sssss> the food was horrible . <sssss> the salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my fist , the burrito was dry and bland . <sssss> they sat us in a room under a tv and it was so loud we could barely talk . <sssss> i 'll have to go back though ... at least give them one more shot . <sssss> .
?		tasteful atmosphere with a great patio , a cozy bar area with stylish mood lighting , a sleek dining room outfitted with red leather chairs , leafy potted plants , and mirrors along the saffron-colored walls . <sssss> they have a good variety of dishes to choose from , all prepared with fresh ingredients and all perfectly cooked and attractively presented . <sssss> i had the guacammus and calamari and both were excellent , but the seafood fresca really stole the show . <sssss> . <sssss> the tilapia was light and flaky and the lime sauce on top was so good my mouth is watering just thinking of it ! <sssss> they also have an excellent happy hour with half priced entrees and good drink specials . <sssss> the only drawback ? <sssss> the sangria , i will admit i am a sangria snob but this was so sweet it was barely drinkable . <sssss> they should really pop over to lola 's tappas and try and duplicate their recipe ! <sssss> all in all great place highly recommended .
?		best damn zucchini fries i have ever had , sprinkled with parmesan and served with a home made ranch . <sssss> they are in no way healthy and in every way delicious . <sssss> these things will blow your mind . <sssss> my favorite is the samburger $ 10 , applewood smoked bacon , substitute pepperjack cheese . <sssss> i really love this place and it is in my regular rotation .
?		closed , it is now called spokes .
?		i am officially a dropout . <sssss> this fox restaurant is humongous ! <sssss> the transformation of the old motorcycle shop was perfectly executed -lrb- see pics -rrb- . <sssss> the dropout bar is big and gorgeous , the inside gives you full view of the kitchen and the awesome preps working behind the counter . <sssss> i had the mussels with garlic , wine , sundried tomatoes and sausage . <sssss> it came with grilled toast that i used as a sponge to soak up the delicious sauce . <sssss> roberto my splendid server/bartender told me they came from washington and they are grown in under a year which accounts for the thick succulent meat and paper thin shell . <sssss> my only critique is that they should serve them in a bowl instead of a platter so the mussels can soak in the broth and not get cold . <sssss> the yard is equally awesome . <sssss> they have pig in a hole , ping pong , bocce ball and shuffle board . <sssss> i can see myself spending many an afternoon here with mimosas in hand . <sssss> apparently it will also function as a live music venue and with the space and set up i can imagine it rockin . <sssss> they have n't started happy hour yet which was a bit disappointing . <sssss> 4 drinks and a shared app came in at about $ 60 bucks which was a bit pricey . <sssss> i love blowing all my funds on food and booze though so i 'm sure i 'll be back this weekend .
?		perhaps i had too high of expectations , but tee pee is no bueno . <sssss> the only saving grace was the salsa , spicy and delicious . <sssss> i ordered a bean and cheese burrito , enchilada style with extra garnish . <sssss> the plate i was given spent way too much time under the broiler and the garnish -lrb- roughly chopped lettuce -rrb- was was wilted by the time it got to the table . <sssss> the enchilada sauce was pretty bland , the beans runny and an overall grease taste superseded any other flavors . <sssss> aside from the food the booths are really uncomfortable . <sssss> maybe we should have sat in the restaurant area in stead of the bar , but looking around all the booths seemed about the same - lumpy lump . <sssss> meh .
?		went to fuego again the other night and was equally impressed . <sssss> i got the camarones patron -lrb- which i think is my favorite dish so far -rrb- and it was spicy and delicious . <sssss> the service was excellent as was the sangria .
?		bombebero 's you 've won my five star rating . <sssss> i am now a regular for breakfast ; the last dish was the uruguayo - spanish chorizo , diced tomatoes , roasted red peppers , cotija cheese , fresh herbs and a splash of chimichurri sauce . <sssss> i ca n't even describe how delicious this dish is . <sssss> the spanish chorizoyou use is top notch . <sssss> you 've won my heart and my five star review for being the perfect place to dine any time of day . <sssss> you are great to bring out of towners you want to impress with your patio . <sssss> your cheese selection is fantastic and your overall ambiance unbeatable . <sssss> i think i may go today . <sssss> .
?		trying to think of something new for my lunch date with robert m. , i remembered they had a $ 5 burger basket at zuma 's . <sssss> i had n't been there for lunch before , i typically stay away from bars when i am working . <sssss> . <sssss> something about a stale nighttime booze smell is not the best for daytime lunch spot . <sssss> . <sssss> we walked in -lrb- yes the booze smell was there -rrb- , we were immediately seated and ordered ice tea . <sssss> to my surprise the $ 5 basket could be a burger or a chicken sandwich with your choice of 3 toppings and came with fries . <sssss> i opted for the chicken with avocado , pepper jack cheese and bacon . <sssss> our order came fast and our bill was under $ 8 bucks . <sssss> was n't the best chicken sandwich in the world but it was worth $ 5 and i would go back again , but probably sit outside on the patio this time to avoid the smell .
?		hobe employs excellent butchers . <sssss> i have been buying my meat here for years and this shop keeps getting better . <sssss> i often buy the packages because they have some really great deals . <sssss> some of my favorites are the ribeye , tri tip , sirloin , butterfly porkchops , chicken breast , and of course the applewood smoked thick cut bacon ! <sssss> they will give you cooking advise and recipe tips if you are in need . <sssss> they do n't just stop at meat though , you can get wonderful bbq sauce , pre-made twice baked potatoes , sweet corn -lrb- in season -rrb- and all sorts of marinades . <sssss> they also carry raw pet food and great doggie bones . <sssss> the saturday special is not only a great deal , but some of the best bbq in phoenix .
?		verde is pretty solid . <sssss> i walked in thinking they really needed to showcase some local artists on their bare walls . <sssss> hopefully that will happen soon enough , it 's a prime downtown location and the place could use a little warming up . <sssss> i tried both the red chili beef and the green chili pork . <sssss> the green was good , but the red really got my taste buds popping . <sssss> i could make out smoked chili , cloves , cinnamon , the distinct flavor and mild heat will definitely bring me back for more . <sssss> the tortillas were amazing and served piping hot . <sssss> they were out of horchata the day i went so there is razone número dos en regresar . <sssss> try it you wo n't be disappointed .
?		this place is the queen of sangria , last time i was there i shared a pitcher and ate all the wine soaked strawberries myself . <sssss> . <sssss> mmmhmm . <sssss> i do however have to go with 3 stars because there is not a very big selection of items for a tapa 's place . <sssss> the one 's they have are good , but the variety is small . <sssss> i 've been there a few times and have already tried everything on the menu : -lrb- i do n't know why anyone would order anything but the delicious sangria , but the bar is also extremely limited . <sssss> overall it is a cool spot and has a great vibe .
?		i have two new favorites , the cauliflower app and the pepperoni pizza -lrb- add ricotta -rrb- . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> service and quality continue to be outstanding . <sssss> monday 's they have amazing specials on pasta/wine or pizza/beer combinations .
?		best breakfast in town . <sssss> carne adovada is amazing , i could live off of the green chili potato , the rellenos are still my favorite . <sssss> . <sssss> big , fat and strong mimosas -lrb- you know how a mimosa should be -rrb- . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with anything on the menu . <sssss> i recently tried the posole and bought another bowl to take home . <sssss> it 's just that good !
?		went to the vig uptown for brunch . <sssss> they need to update their website as they are actually open at 10am -lrb- not 11am -rrb- . <sssss> i was glad to hear it as i have turned into more of an early bird in my older age and i was impatient and calling by 10:01 i have to admit , i think this i my new favorite brunch spot . <sssss> i started with a fresh squeezed watermelon mimosa and it was delicious . <sssss> i ordered some pork and eggs that was out of this world . <sssss> slow simmered pork , beans , peas , under an egg and surrounded by grilled bananas , it was awesome ! <sssss> i also tried the yogurt parfait and while it was fresh and delicious there was an overwhelming amount of dried fruit in it . <sssss> my fillings were hurting by the time i left , but it was still tasty . <sssss> dicks and phoenix city grill now have some stiff competition for my favorite brunch dishes . <sssss> selfishly , i hope they do n't get too busy because it was really nice not to have to wait for valet or a table . <sssss> one more reason why i love living in uptown .
?		my heart finally broke and it had been so long bent ... please bring breakfast back !
?		the pancakes are amazing . <sssss> iced soy coffee and the sweet berry pancake is my new favorite breakfast ! <sssss> -lrb- see pics -rrb- .
?		dear ra your service completely sucks for lunch . <sssss> if i go in when it is packed it takes me 1:20 + for lunch , if i go in when it is dead it takes me 1:20 + for lunch . <sssss> the music is always blaring so loud i can barely hear my dining partners . <sssss> this is n't a club , it is a restaurant at lunch time , set the vibe right ... i really like the salmon teriyaki bento box , but every time i order it the pot stickers are cold . <sssss> seriously every time . <sssss> can you please make a few improvements ? <sssss> i want to go back , you have a decent happy hour but fail miserably for lunch . <sssss> sincerely , sunny
?		i have been wanting to try lo-lo 's for a while now and let me tell you this place did not disappoint . <sssss> there are so many great reviews i do n't have much to add . <sssss> here 's what i loved : i saw shaq walking out when i was coming in they serve kool aid and strong a $ $ ice tea in mason jars the fried chicken must have crack in it - so juicy and delicious , you know it 's bad for you but you keep coming back . <sssss> . <sssss> just one more hit fried okra rocks waffles are slightly sweet and cinnamony and who woulda thought to throw some fried chicken on top ! <sssss> this is not the sort of joint to frequent if you care at all about your waistline , but when you want to indulge go to lo-lo 's , get the fried chicken on a waffle and try not to go in to a coma before you leave .
?		now open for lunch ! <sssss> previously i had only been here to meet friends for happy hour , and they have an excellent tequila selection . <sssss> they have expanded the patio just in time to take advantage of our gorgeous weather . <sssss> i got the pibil pork tacos served with a habanero mango salsa , they were sweet , spicy and delicious . <sssss> three to an order for eight bucks , and it was the perfect amount of food . <sssss> i was in and out in under 40 minutes . <sssss> i think this may be a new `` go to '' spot for lunch .
?		let 's see $ 4 bucks in my wallet and hungry for some lovely asada . <sssss> . <sssss> not possible you say ? <sssss> then you have n't been to el pollo fn supremo . <sssss> i love this place . <sssss> i can smell the meat roasting from blocks away . <sssss> . <sssss> you can get 1/4 chicken -lrb- that you can rip into with your bare hands -rrb- or beef and they pile you up with fresh tortillas , great pinto beans , marinated onions and fresh salsa . <sssss> you make your own burritos with all this delicious filling mmmmhhhhhhmmmmm . <sssss> or you can fool your family into thinking you are a grill master and buy an entire chicken -lrb- point out how hot it was while whilst grilling when they are chomping down - major points -rrb- . <sssss> seriously ! <sssss> it 's so good . <sssss> they only take cash so either hit the atm or stand outside and spang for change . <sssss> . <sssss> the stoners going in to hq are pretty vulnerable haha .
?		first , a public service announcement ... tonkotsu = pork bone . <sssss> broth that is used as a ramen soup base . <sssss> tonkatsu = pork cutlet -lrb- breaded in panko -rrb- . <sssss> something you eat over rice . <sssss> thank you . <sssss> we now return to our regular opinionated review ... so you just saw tanpopo or ramen girl and wanted to try some ramen from a place that specializes in ramen to see what all the fuss was really about . <sssss> you come into this place , order a bowl of miso ramen and patiently await your meal . <sssss> when the girl brings your ramen you close your eyes and imagine yourself in some quaint ramen shop somewhere in japan - bullet train in the distance , enka playing from the shop 's speakers . <sssss> you put the ramen broth to your lips and ... pppppppppppffffffffffffffffffffffftttttttttttttttt !!!!!!!!!! <sssss> almost spit it all back into the bowl . <sssss> instantly you 're back in tempe - light rail in the distance , alternative rock blasting from the speakers . <sssss> the broth has not a molecule of miso flavor that your tongue can detect . <sssss> hell , maruchan and top ramen have more flavor in their `` flavor packets '' than this sorry excuse for a broth . <sssss> anyway , that 's sorta what happened to me more or less . <sssss> came in with rather high expectations and had them shattered the moment i tasted the broth . <sssss> umm ... did i order the shoyu ramen by accident i wondered ? <sssss> if so , miso silly ! <sssss> if i did , though , there should be a stronger shoyu flavor . <sssss> the noodles themselves tasted ok . <sssss> there were some slices of char siu and they were passable - meaning they actually had a flavor that resembles char siu . <sssss> but still , this place would n't even cut it as a hospital cafe in a bad part of tokyo . <sssss> reading some of the other reviews , however , i guess it can cut it in a strip mall in tempe on the south side of east university drive . <sssss> i 'd actually been here once before a while back and do n't even remember what i ordered - it was that good . <sssss> so i came back a second time just to make sure . <sssss> fool me once , shame on you . <sssss> fool me twice , miso stupid ! <sssss> so i 'm still hoping for a real ramen place to open up in the valley someday . <sssss> yeah , sure , some japanese restaurants have ramen on their menu . <sssss> i mean an actual ramen shop that just serves ramen . <sssss> maybe yakisoba and udon as well but primarily ramen . <sssss> one can dream , right ?
?		so in the ne corner of mcclintock and southern right next to the cockblister dvd rental there is a chicago style hot dog joint that i 've been coming to for some time during the lunch hour . <sssss> always ample parking . <sssss> ambience is good - a bunch of tables and the speakers seem to be always blasting indie/alternative tunes . <sssss> the girl with the dragon tattoo that works the cash register is sweet and very talented - quite a dish . <sssss> but she 's not on the menu . <sssss> bummer . <sssss> instead , i usually get the chicago style hot dog with pickles , peppers , tomatoes , onions , mustard and relish . <sssss> always a good choice . <sssss> otherwise i usually get the juicy italian beef . <sssss> it is very messy and either wear a bib or just do n't wear a white shirt that day - you 've been warned . <sssss> burgers are also quite tasty and you do n't need to worry about the pink slime here . <sssss> the chili is also very good - either as a topping or on it 's own .
?		this place is in the lunch rotation . <sssss> whenever we decide to go a little further than our usual lunch location radius and venture into ahwatukee . <sssss> it 's in a mall -lrb- is n't everything anymore -rrb- and there 's always plenty of parking . <sssss> you might want to come before noon , though , if you are in a big group and want to sit inside . <sssss> the place seems to be pretty popular after being featured in dumpsters , divers , and douchebags or whatever that program is called . <sssss> i do n't like going anywhere just because some tv program hyped it up . <sssss> might as well eat at mcdonald 's because you 've seen their commercials so many times . <sssss> anyway , i 've tried most of their street tacos and i 'm partial to the marinated pork -lrb- carnitas -rrb- . <sssss> not sure why they have spanish for most of their menu but instead of carnitas it 's `` marinated pork . '' <sssss> it is an interesting recipe - includes condensed milk and coca-cola . <sssss> that 's the secret recipe . <sssss> well , either the secret 's been let out of the bag or it was n't ever that secret because when i googled carnitas recipes there were hundreds with those same two ingredients . <sssss> whatever the case , i love that flavor and i 'm addicted to it . <sssss> is it really the kind of coke you drink or the other kind ? <sssss> whatever the case , i like it and will keep coming back .
?		formerly known as the counter - this has always been a quick stop in for a great salad , soup or sandwich . <sssss> its a neighborhood diner-style that looks like they would serve old-fashioned milk-shakes ... and guess what ... they do ! <sssss> i even bought a sandwich press of my very own because of this place !! <sssss> ever since i had one of their hot pressed sandwiches i was hooked . <sssss> i usually stop in here to load up before shopping at kierland - its quick , clean and cheap !!
?		what a great idea - self serve frozen yogurt ! <sssss> a lot of flavors and even more toppings - yummy ! <sssss> i think there is a lot to be said for making this yourself - its almost like being at home making your own dessert . <sssss> i had the dolce de leche yogurt with chocolate sauce , oreos and choc chips - no one can say that 's a bad combination ... because i made it for myself - i think that 's the magic here .
?		i can never go wrong with a restaurant from fox concepts it seems ! <sssss> the bar area is definitely good ` people watching ' and i love the modern contemporary decor . <sssss> where did they get the lighting for the bar area ? <sssss> the menu is healthy mediterranean and i love sitting outside on the patio . <sssss> they also feature a ` take-out market-side ' - i think they have some top notch croissants too !! <sssss> i have n't been there for brunch yet so that 's on my list and will have to return !
?		over-priced , over-crowded and every time i have been there ... it has confirmed that they pour the worst martini ! <sssss> but if you are looking to ` people watch ' this is the place - the interior permits a great open ambiance with an open area overlooking the bar . <sssss> i think the exhaust-system isnt strong enough for the teppan tables because i smell like heavy fried food when i leave !!
?		us airways has been my domestic airline of choice . <sssss> i experience the best connections and convenience in the variety in connections , period . <sssss> i think in reading all of the reviews regarding delays ... i hardly believe that there exists an airline that experiences better timing . <sssss> maybe i have n't noticed . <sssss> but what i do notice is the hospitality factor . <sssss> flying is n't what it used to be prior to 9/11 but i do appreciate us airways and the positive service that i receive . <sssss> they make a difference to me and my weekly schedule.comparatively i feel they succeed other domestic choices .
?		this is an oldie and a goodie ! <sssss> here they celebrate the cuisine of northern italy - salut !! <sssss> apart from being very dark inside - it didnt really help that the menu was completely in italian -lrb- i love this though ... -rrb- but it had the translations underneath in even smaller script - great - i will just have one of everything !! <sssss> the cuisine was traditional in the ` hunter-style ' rich sauces and meats - yum . <sssss> service was great - and wine selection even better . <sssss> i try not to frequent too many italian restaurants -lrb- on purpose ! <sssss> -rrb- but this one is always on my list .
?		visited 5/5/12 ... in my opinion , this restaurant truly fits the phrase `` it is all about the experience . '' <sssss> the food dishes we had were outstanding !! <sssss> i very much enjoyed the food selections including sugar snap peas , shasito peppers , kimchi , scallops with strawberry , seared tuna , and pork belly . <sssss> the last being a must . <sssss> . <sssss> our friends also ordered sea bass and clams . <sssss> my compliments to the chef as each dish had a nice unique taste that is not typical at other places . <sssss> the setting is very intimate being set in an very old historic home in downtown . <sssss> the portions are very small !! <sssss> and for me , this is disappointing . <sssss> especially when you compare the price to the portion . <sssss> now before anyone wants to respond , i acknowledge that this is about the experience . <sssss> and the food was excellent !! <sssss> but in these trying times , when i drop almost $ 100.00 for two for dinner , i at least want to walk out without feeling like i need to hit the closest fast food place . <sssss> i would go back . <sssss> this would be a great place for a quick appetizer type of start . <sssss> go in , experience a couple of dishes that offer a nice fresh change in taste . <sssss> then head out for dinner . <sssss> but not a regular type of place for me . <sssss> go here for the atmosphere and experience . <sssss> enjoy some different dishes that taste great . <sssss> but find a regular somewhere else . <sssss> p.s. located right next to rose and crown . <sssss> a nice tavern in a similar style house in the heritage area . <sssss> great locations for ballparks and convention center .
?		hello downtown sushi favorite !!! <sssss> meeting with a friend from out of town that was staying in downtown . <sssss> i have seen this location but not been here before . <sssss> it is located in the cityscape area . <sssss> behind tilted kilt . <sssss> next to ice arena for anyone trying to figure out where it is at . <sssss> i was extremely impressed with service and food . <sssss> had too many rolls to remember . <sssss> the sashimi platter had several different cuts of great fish . <sssss> pricing was very comparable to what i have experienced at many other locations . <sssss> the bottled beer choices were a little disappointing . <sssss> i enjoy the japanese beers and they had limited . <sssss> would love to see them expand this part of menu . <sssss> got so involved , so quickly , we forgot to take photos . <sssss> this will be a regular for downtown . <sssss> looking forward to my next trip downtown to return . <sssss> would also be a great place to sit outside before baseball game and watch light rail go by . <sssss> .
?		visited 5/8/12 ... what can i say , its cracker barrel . <sssss> have been there many times . <sssss> never reviewed before now . <sssss> do n't know why . <sssss> southern food . <sssss> had country fried steak , mashed potatoes , fried oakra . <sssss> it all tasted very good . <sssss> went in for dinner . <sssss> but found myself very tempted when i was given a breakfast anytime menu . <sssss> not too many places that i would try the breakfast menu in the evening , but this might be a place i will have to remember for breakfast in the evening fix .
?		7/29/12 little secret in amongst the jewelry shops . <sssss> wanted a cider . <sssss> ended up with an orange cream soda float . <sssss> it was good but a little small and chintzy on ice cream . <sssss> but it was good . <sssss> nice snack . <sssss> but nothing to bring me there in and of itself . <sssss> also root beer tapa were not working so only had their bottled stuff . <sssss> but got to listen to employees complaining about tapa not working . <sssss> if i was wandering old town , i would stop in again . <sssss> but nothing that would bring me out of my way !
?		matt 's big breakfast is the best breakfast in phoenix . <sssss> fresh , organic , and wherever possible , local ingredients , cooked up to perfection . <sssss> delicious coffee . <sssss> crowded , especially on weekends . <sssss> worth the wait . <sssss> get there early or after rush hour on weekdays . <sssss> worth every penny .
?		good variety of deli-style food , big portions . <sssss> not sure about how healthy the food is - it seems a bit greasy / fatty . <sssss> but there 's definitely something here for everybody in your party , meat lover to vegetarian .
?		sit back and i will tell you a story about the comerica theater . <sssss> i believe i have mentioned that my son loves the fresh beat band , and he is 2 . <sssss> welp folks they decided to go on tour and i bought tickets . <sssss> let me tell you how that went down . <sssss> me : im buying tickets to the fresh beat band concert hubby : um , do n't you think he is a little young ? <sssss> me : trust me hubby : ok you 're going with him right ? <sssss> me : sigh ... yeah . <sssss> i purchased 2 tickets , and on the day of i explain to my son that we are going to go see the fbb . <sssss> we get to the theater and park across the street , not too terribly pricey , and walk to the front entrance . <sssss> there is a line , explain a line to a 2 year old . <sssss> then try explaining waiting . <sssss> that was the worst part of the evening -lrb- at no fault of the venues -rrb- . <sssss> we walk in and what do they have ? <sssss> merchandise tables ... yeah ok i figured i would have to do this , so we go get the program , the shirt , the flashy light pen and we are set . <sssss> then ... i see it . <sssss> coamerica theater you people are genius . <sssss> they have the snack bar open , serving very large alcoholic beverages ranging from draft beer , to super huge smirnoff ice -lrb- because why not -rrb- . <sssss> if you are going to be subjecting your brain to something mind numbing its always nice to take the edge off . <sssss> bravo marketing for ct. . <sssss> . <sssss> bravo . <sssss> we get our refreshments . <sssss> the kid got water and popcorn ... come on now , and go to watch the show . <sssss> seating was very well laid out , lighting was great , and when the band came on stage -lrb- and they were as close to being on time as i have ever seen -rrb- he went absolutely bananas . <sssss> all in all i was very comfortable at this venue , regardless of the fact that the show was great , and my husband was disappointed he did n't go in the end .
?		cabela 's is a good store to go and just browse . <sssss> the animal decor is by far one of the neatest things here . <sssss> also getting any fishing/hunting licenses here is a good thing because the people here are more knowledgeable then your typical walmart sports department worker . <sssss> having said that i rarely buy things from cabela 's that are not on sale . <sssss> i can go to target/kmart and get what i need for much cheaper . <sssss> if you are looking for something , high end , super specific , or just want to go check out the taxidermy this is the place for you !
?		a friend of mine decided to pay 20.00 and get a lifetime membership to rei in order to take advantage of their rei yard sale they have once a year where you can get gear 30-70 % off retail price . <sssss> sounded like a deal so i signed up as well . <sssss> day of the yard sale there was a huge line waiting to be let into the `` yard sale area '' which consisted of about 12 tables full of items and they would come refill them occasionally . <sssss> however , if you were not one of the first 10 people in or you were n't interested in used shoes you were out of luck . <sssss> the first 10 people in took the giant camping packs and scooped up all of the camping gear into it whether they needed it or not , it was a free for all with people packed in like sardines . <sssss> i found an air mattress that may or may not have a leak i have yet to test this , however that is what the tag said . <sssss> after staying in the sardine can for about an hour i finally decided to take my air mattress inside , they have camping gear during the sale , so they must have killer gear inside . <sssss> i go inside and the sticker prices were astronomically high . <sssss> i am sure you are getting good quality items but for someone who goes camping maybe once or twice a year i could not bring myself to pay full retail on the items they were asking for . <sssss> i would rather go to kmart or target and get what i need , heck even cabella 's has better deals . <sssss> i hear that the paradise valley location handles their yard sale differently and takes in groups at a time . <sssss> since i have the lifetime membership i will scope it out at least once . <sssss> all in all unless you are going to be back packing all over europe or living in the wilderness , go find your gear some place cheaper .
?		i had high hopes going into this place when i worked over by it . <sssss> the menu was slightly confusing to order from , the rosemary-garlic fries were good but the burger was kind of meh . <sssss> nothing to really write home about , or make me say i would really like to go back ! <sssss> the staff was nice , the wait was n't bad , and the environment was clean . <sssss> if you are just looking for a place to stop by and try so you do n't have to go to arby 's across the street certainly give this place a look-see .
?		my kids absolutely love to go to mary coyle , my aunt takes them there quite often . <sssss> i had the pleasure to visit with them a few months back and it was delicious . <sssss> i can see why they get excited . <sssss> i had the almond joy sundae and i am glad i order the small one , because it was still huge ! <sssss> very rich and creamy ice cream , ask for water to help cleanse your pallet . <sssss> they have a great selection of ice creams and sundaes , if you can not find something to appease your ice cream craving here , you just are n't trying . <sssss> the decor is a lot of fun too , old school soda shop atmosphere and surprisingly enough they do birthday parties here . <sssss> very cool -lrb- no pun intended -rrb- . <sssss> did i mention they have an ice cream dish called `` the mountain '' ? <sssss> this is supposed to feed 10 people . <sssss> dear food network ... specifically man vs. food ... mary coyle just called you out ! <sssss> certainly make time to stop by this gem of the phoenix valley . <sssss> i will be a repeat customer .
?		big fun ! <sssss> one of the best run marathons i have ever seen . <sssss> the entertainment along the way keeps your spirits up , even when your feet are dying . <sssss> my only problem was that i was too wiped out after the marathon to enjoy the free admission to the after concert/party
?		after reading the wonderful reviews of this place , i decided to stop in to get my fix instead of the little vietnamese place in the corner of lee lees . <sssss> i tossed my grocery bags in the car , grabbed my $ 4 and hiked across the parking lot to boba tea house . <sssss> last time i drove by boba tea house , the place was packed . <sssss> not true of this visit . <sssss> it was so empty the place echoed . <sssss> it 's a cute place . <sssss> i like the couches , and they have a couple of lappies on a table at the side for people to use . <sssss> i am going to assume it is free because while i was there , a guy popped in , used a laptop , and left . <sssss> either he 's a regular and has an account , or it was free because i did n't see him pull out a card to credit to use it . <sssss> the orange and green wall menu has all the milk teas , slushes , snows and other beverages divided into categories . <sssss> most are named for exactly what they are . <sssss> a couple are named for appearance ... like sunset , but not enough to confuse anyone . <sssss> there is also a section for snacks that has tasty tidbits that are perfectly sized for sharing . <sssss> i noticed coconut shrimp , and a few other little fried things . <sssss> i decided to have a coconut slush . <sssss> it was good , but it was not as good as i thought it would be . <sssss> it was a little bitter , and a was not blended as well as i have had in other places . <sssss> the snack i chose for lunch was the really delightful surprise . <sssss> i came for the boba , but now i am hooked on their calamari . <sssss> i have never had fresher or more tender calamari . <sssss> it was absolutely perfect . <sssss> i 'm always cautious about it too because most places overcook it til it is about the same texture as a bicycle inner tube ... this was delicious . <sssss> i had it medium spicy , which was my mistake . <sssss> next time i will order my calamari spiced mild . <sssss> it 's a good thing i got coconut boba to cool my taste buds after each bite .
?		pho avina is a lovely casual little place for excellent vietnamese food . <sssss> the food is fresh , and delightful . <sssss> the menu is extensive and has all the traditional vietnamese dishes i expected . <sssss> in addition to pho , they serve other noodle -lrb- rice noodle and saigon noodle -rrb- and rice dishes as well as appetizers and salads . <sssss> under no circumstances would i compare it to cyclo . <sssss> cyclo is not a traditional vietnamese restaurant ... pho avina is . <sssss> i would compare the variety and quality to saigon pho on alma school , which is one of my favorite restaurants . <sssss> they also have a nice selection of boba drinks . <sssss> i had a coconut one this time . <sssss> i have had avocado , coffee , and mango as well . <sssss> so far , coconut is my favorite . <sssss> i think next time i will try taro . <sssss> mmmmm ... so good . <sssss> i was so enamored with this place that i expect to stop there on the way home from work at least once every week or 2 . <sssss> i need to add this note now ... since i first reviewed this place , it has become a real favorite of mine . <sssss> i stop here at least 1 or 2 times a week , and when i do , i often run into friends who learned about the place from me . <sssss> i 'm headed there for dinner tonight .
?		* sigh another place that used to be the best in town , and is now an embarrassment . <sssss> food off the chinese menu is still good , but the regular menu is no longer up to snuff . <sssss> sauces that were once delicate and light are now weighted down with starch and made unbearable with sugar . <sssss> i went with about 6 other people and the only dishes we enjoyed were some pan fried noodles , and some stir fried greens . <sssss> i do n't even know what the greens were ... maybe snow pea leaves ... but they were good . <sssss> still 2 out of the 10 dishes we ordered is n't a good record .
?		i 'm a devout fan of a particular burger place in the midwest that does not exist in phoenix . <sssss> i missed it terribly , until i had my first burger from culver 's . <sssss> now , i can head over to culver 's whenever i feel like one of those amazing burgers . <sssss> my only challenge is choosing between a butter burger , a reuben , a mushroom swiss burger , a pot roast sandwich or any number of other delicious things on their menu . <sssss> oh yeah , they have great frozen custard .
?		plan for this meal . <sssss> you must plan for this meal because one sandwich is big enough to be food for the whole day . <sssss> the location is in a tiny strip mall just north of dunlap . <sssss> it 's nothing fancy . <sssss> expect to see all kinds of people , lots of them , and they are all talking loudly . <sssss> this afternoon , when i was there , the place was packed with hispanic families with lots of small kids , a bunch of older white haired people who must live nearby and their newspapers , a couple of tourists , and a nice kid who said his brother had sent him to pick up dinner . <sssss> he had never been there and looked around cautiously at the place until the waitress finally spoke english to him . <sssss> since the place is named for the beautiful sandwiches they serve , i will start with those ... soft buns are loaded with different combinations of ham , breaded beef , pork sirloin , eggs , chicken , cheese , guacamole , assorted peppers or chilies , tomato and sometimes a little onion ... one torta is more than enough for 2 people . <sssss> they have taco plates with 3 tacos for under $ 5 . <sssss> their tacos come in varieties you may not have considered before ... how about beef tongue tacos ? <sssss> or perhaps beef brains ? <sssss> for the less adventurous , they have hawaiian -lrb- beef , bacon , ham , bell peppers , pineapple , and cheese -rrb- or chorizo . <sssss> i like the shrimp quesedillas ... also big enough to split . <sssss> there are a lot of different shrimp dishes on the menu . <sssss> i should try a few others , but every time i walk in the door , i can hear the quesedilla calling my name . <sssss> they have fresh fruit drinks served in fishbowl sized goblets , and different kinds of fruit cocktail with whipped cream , honey or sweet cream for dessert . <sssss> they also have flan in different flavors . <sssss> i noticed a good breakfast menu that is served before 11 am , but i have never tried it . <sssss> i think i would end up going home to sleep off the food if i tried to eat a big meal like that in the am .
?		i 've been to haji-baba 's a couple of times now and i must say ... my visits have not been met with consistency in the quality of their food . <sssss> haji-baba is super popular as you can see by the yelp reviews of this place . <sssss> the main reason for their popularity i think is due to their prices . <sssss> their prices are almost ridiculously low for the portion sizes you get when compared to other mediterranean ~ greek type of restaurants . <sssss> i did find something i liked at haji-baba . <sssss> i recommend you try their gyros . <sssss> it 's a really good gyros and is one of the best in the phoenix metro . <sssss> they do n't shave their gyros meat like at the other places . <sssss> they cut their gyros meat off in long chunks , different sizes . <sssss> this adds another level of `` delicious-ness '' when compared to gyros at other locations . <sssss> they over stuff their gyros with meat , a small amount of tomatoes , red onions and pickled wild cucumbers with some tzatziki sauce . <sssss> the pickled wild cucumbers were unexpected and a nice change from other plaecs that serve gyros . <sssss> my gyros needed a bit more tzatziki , but my server was slammed and forgot it , oh well . <sssss> as for everything else on their menu ~ meh , i 've had better . <sssss> their dolmades , rice and kibbee all tasted old and over cooked . <sssss> the shawarma and falafels also tasted over cooked and were very dry for my liking . <sssss> restaurant location and condition ~ 2 to 3 stars service ~ 3 stars food ~ 2 to 3 stars -lrb- except for the gyros which are 4.5 stars -rrb- prices ~ 5 plus stars i 'm looking forward to going back for another gyros and maybe i 'll try their hummus and/or a greek salad on my next . <sssss> hope to see you there .
?		we 've tried mellow mushroom a couple of times now hoping the food and service is better than our prior visits because we love how this place feels and their location . <sssss> they are conveniently located in front of one of the best movie theaters in northern phoenix , harkins at norterra . <sssss> oddly enough this mellow mushroom does n't offer the `` dinner & movie '' promotion other mm 's offer from their web site . <sssss> in fact we found very few promotions this location is offering compared to other mm 's according to their web site . <sssss> again this place has a really cool vibe with some neat decor through out the restaurant . <sssss> they have both indoor and out door seating and their bar has some tv 's to catch a game while eating . <sssss> they have an awesome beer selection which is probably their best feature with out a doubt and probably the reason i keep coming back . <sssss> their pizza ~ they have a good variety of topping to choose from but you either like their crust or you do n't . <sssss> we unfortunately do n't like it because it 's more like bread and not crust . <sssss> it 's too chewy and you have to eat it with a fork . <sssss> we loved the toppings and beer . <sssss> our server could not remember our drinks and we had to ask someone else to get our bill ... i tried their mushroom club on my last visit with chips and an iced tea . <sssss> the fresh sprouts on top were more yellow and brown and not green at all . <sssss> my server stated `` we got a fresh shipment in today '' and then walked off . <sssss> after scrapping them off because they did not taste good i found my sandwich very cold in the center compared to the rest of the sandwich which was average temp for a club . <sssss> so i ate around the center . <sssss> my chips looked like they were scooped from the bottom of the bag if you know what i mean . <sssss> these were chips of chips ... i had track down my server since she was more interest in carrying on conversations with the other , very young , servers hanging out around their desk in the middle of the restaurant . <sssss> i showed her my `` chips of chips '' and she stated `` that 's how our chips are . <sssss> many people complain about them and i do n't know why we serve them '' and then off she went again ... i asked another passing server to see a manager hoping to give them some good feedback concerning my experience but they never came by my table . <sssss> i found the best time to go to mm is during their happy hour just before catching a movie when you can get half priced beer and apps . <sssss> for if they did not have this promo i would probably never go back to this mm . <sssss> because of this promo and their awesome beer selection i am giving them an a ~ ok rating .
?		z 's greek is a solid 4 to 5 stars every time i visit this little place just around the corner of 40th and indian school . <sssss> do n't let the exterior of this place deter you from stopping by . <sssss> z 's greek looks sort of `` a dive '' from the curb and they desperately in need to repave their parking lot which is littered with pot holes . <sssss> but , and i mean a big but , the inside is very clean and welcoming . <sssss> they have a fairly large menu of greek selections to choose from . <sssss> i tend to order the same thing ~ gyro with a side greek salad in lieu of fries and drink for $ 7.95 . <sssss> on this visit i added a side of hummus and pita chips . <sssss> this gyro was packed full with meat , tomatoes , red onions and thee perfect amount of tzatziki sauce . <sssss> -lrb- see pic -rrb- the pita was tender and warm which made this gyro full of flavor . <sssss> the greek salad comes with a mound of feta cheese on top of a great balance of lettuce , veggies and dressing . <sssss> i would highly recommend their salad over fries any day when ordering a combo . <sssss> the hummus was very tasty ~ smooth and fresh . <sssss> you can order anything to your liking if you do n't see something on their menu you are familiar with . <sssss> the z 's greek crazy fries and souvlaki 's are also very good . <sssss> z 's greek is a great place for lunch or dinner when you 're craving grecian cuisine . <sssss> just look out for the pot holes when you park : - -rrb- you wo n't be disappointed and glad you tried z 's greek !!
?		it 's obvious that everyone that walks in the door here loves it . <sssss> this is one of three carolina 's in the phoenix metro . <sssss> i 've wanting to try the original carolina 's near downtown but did not want to drive all the way down to `` da ghetto '' all `` gangsta like '' to eat some fast mexican food . <sssss> i have been to both north and west locations and found them to be very good and consistent . <sssss> after standing in line to order like at a `` taco stand '' i sat down and noticed all the dishes coming out of the kitchen , and i started to almost drool . <sssss> then my number was called and the funny urge to yell bingo , but rather went up to the counter to get my piping hot machaca burrito with papas and a side of chips and spicy salsa -lrb- served in styro-foam , argue !! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> while the salsa heat was almost too much for my taste buds , it was simply delicious and even took some home . <sssss> holy cow , this was amazing for the price . <sssss> as so many others have mentioned their tortillas are simply delish !! <sssss> the beans were a good consistency , not too runny , not to dry and the rice had a great flavor . <sssss> again the food is a great value for the price . <sssss> in summary , despite that fact this place is not eco-friendly by using stryo-foam it is more over a place that is convenient off the 101 and peoria if you 're in the area looking for good , fast mexican food . <sssss> this is not necessarily a destination place to plan for but rather a place of convenience with tasty food .
?		coup des tartes is a solid 4 stars with the potential of being 5 stars with a few menu updates . <sssss> after reading some of the yelper reviews i was a bit perplexed about what to expect when a friend invited me to join him at coup des tartes . <sssss> after h told me this is a byo , pas de probleme ~ you can count me in !! <sssss> first off , there are not enough fine dinning byo places in phoenix ! <sssss> please help me spread this throughout the valley !! <sssss> it 's a `` good time '' when you 're able to bring your favorite wines with you to dine and not pay the restaurant 's prices . <sssss> especially when it 's at a place that offers quality food and service at reasonable prices . <sssss> sure there is a `` cork fee '' , but i look at it this way ~ i would rather pay $ 9 for the `` cork fee '' and $ 30 for a bottle of chateau la galiane cabernet sauvignon i can buy at total wine , which would cost $ 100 -lrb- plus -rrb- at any other fining dinning restaurant . <sssss> their food and drink pricing is very reasonable considering the quality and taste . <sssss> this is where i think cdt has an opportunity to improve . <sssss> they have a limited menu and since they are a french restaurant , they should think about offering some of the more updated french dishes . <sssss> a stereotypical french meal is heavy in saturated fats ; heavy creams and butter which are staples in many french dishes and what cdt offers is no different . <sssss> think about offering some of the newer french style dishes that include crepes , more game meats and sea food dishes . <sssss> appetizer ~ their delicious three onion tart and it was excellent ! <sssss> -lrb- sweet and savory and decadent -rrb- . <sssss> we also had the mate horn and the mozzarella and tomato salad which was very good . <sssss> entrees ~ the filet mignon , cooked mid-rare of course with sides of mashed potatoes and haricots verts . <sssss> i had their signature dish : the lamb shank . <sssss> it was extremely meaty , `` fall off the bone '' tender . <sssss> the couscous was very fresh and it had just the right amount of veggies and sauce to pull everything together . <sssss> desert ~ pumpkin tarte and fresh cup of french café . <sssss> it was also very good . <sssss> service ~ exceptional . <sssss> they were extremely attentive and very friendly , but not too friendly if you know what i mean ... they brought us a wine decanter and an aerator without asking . <sssss> the place is very quaint with somewhat of a homely feel and yet very simple in décor . <sssss> wine ~ fantastique ! <sssss> will plan to bring a second bottle next time !
?		joining me for a phoenix suns and az d-backs game , you will find me at alice cooperstown . <sssss> it 's a great blend of sports and music !! <sssss> this place is `` off the hizzle ~ zizzle '' when it comes to a great place to meet friends prior to and after a game in downtown phoenix . <sssss> it 's a unique combination of quality bar style food with an energetic atmosphere . <sssss> their service is good . <sssss> everyone that works here is all done up in their best face paint `` alla alice cooper-esque '' and the walls are full of memorabilia from both randy johnson and alice cooper creating one of the most unique places in the city to dine and drink . <sssss> seating is available both inside and on their patio . <sssss> they have a court yard too where bands play and for unique events . <sssss> their food again is good but remember it 's primarily a sports bar . <sssss> i 've had `` the big unit '' hot dog with all the trimmings as seen on man vs food . <sssss> it 's surprisingly good and a great thing to share with a couple of friends . <sssss> the whole place yells out `` the big unit '' when it 's served . <sssss> it made me feel somewhat `` manly '' more so than usual : -- rrb - i recommend their bbq chicken , tommy 's cali burger and their `` no more mr. nice guy ~ chipotle chicken pasta ~ yum ! <sssss> they also offer a low carb menu for those healthy eaters if you can believe that . <sssss> food = 4 service = 4 great time to have with friends = 5 !! <sssss> i hope to see you there sometime before or after a sun 's or d-backs game !
?		mi patio mexican restaurant is a great place to go for really good south of the border type of food that is really inexpensive . <sssss> this place is cheap !! <sssss> and good : -- rrb - some really great friends of ours got us hooked on mi patio quite some time ago . <sssss> they are that kind of place that may not get your `` frequent dinning '' card but you 'll remember them after a couple of months go by and go back . <sssss> restaurant ~ it 's kind of smallish and cozy looking on the outside but they really have plenty of room on the inside . <sssss> the decor is a fun spanish style with plenty of vibrant colors and textures . <sssss> it 's not fancy by any means but very fun ! <sssss> service ~ is fantastic ! <sssss> we 've been several times and have had different servers and they are all very friendly , helpful and eager to serve to you . <sssss> food ~ chips and salsa are excellente ! <sssss> we have not had a bad meal here , everything is good ! <sssss> it probably wo n't be the best you 've ever had but they are very good and extremely consistent . <sssss> i prefer their chili relleno or their baja chicken burro or their baja spinach and feta cheese chimi ! <sssss> on my last visit they combined both baja 's into one pollo-spinach-cheesy-delicioso-burro ! <sssss> tasty factor times 2 ! <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with just about anything on their menu . <sssss> we try something different on every visit ; -- rrb - beverages ~ skip the $ 2.40 soda ... and go for the $ 1.75 margarita 's !! <sssss> yeah !! <sssss> they may not be the best margaritas but where else can you get a pitcher of this tasty beverage for $ 9 ? <sssss> this is a great place to go with friends , have a good time and go el-cheap-o and not feel bad about it . <sssss> we are grateful our friends introduced us to mi patio mexican restaurant !
?		who would have thought tommy bahamas was anything but a clothing store ?? <sssss> i 've eaten here at least three of four times and despite some of the mixed yelp reviews , i really like this place . <sssss> i recommend going early for drinks at the bar . <sssss> ok ... i recommend going to the bar almost always regardless of where you go out to eat . <sssss> it makes it for a `` good time '' with your friends , especially at tommy bahamas due to their topical-tropicana-beach-esk theme they have going on . <sssss> they will make you almost any kind of `` fruity ~ tropical '' kind of drink known to mankind . <sssss> we sat outside in their patio area under an umbrella . <sssss> very enjoyable and a high recommend when you go . <sssss> the tropical music they pipe through the air and the magnum-esque clothing worn by the staff all make for a relaxing atmosphere . <sssss> we were there on a weekday , and it was pretty empty until the conference crowd showed up just after noon . <sssss> the food was surprisingly good . <sssss> i had the lemongrass encrusted ahi , seared rare , sweet chili sauce , cilantro oil , island almond rice , shiitake mushrooms , minus the toasted sesame seeds with baby bok choy . <sssss> it was a little pricing at $ 30 - but very good ! <sssss> the crab bisque was also good . <sssss> they also offer some gluten free dinner and lunch selections as well . <sssss> the real surprise here was the service . <sssss> our waiter -lrb- i wish i remembered his name -rrb- was amazing . <sssss> very friendly and attentive . <sssss> for example , i asked for more chili sauce and he brought out both the chili sauce and their spicier chili sauce which he thought i might like better . <sssss> awesome ! <sssss> yes this is a `` touristy '' kind of place and it 's over priced , but it is also a good dinning experience to have with your friends and a cool place to shop for that special magnum-esque attire you 've always wanted : - -rrb-
?		this grimaldi 's is a ~ ok if your in the area looking for good pizza . <sssss> i usually rave about one of the other girmaldi locations to my friends and since we were in the area we thought , why not try this grimaldi 's . <sssss> after all it 's a girmaldi 's and the patsy girmaldi 's in dc ranch taste a like the girmaldi 's in new york . <sssss> we were a little concerned when we arrived since this place was very slow and it was during peak lunch time . <sssss> the service was ok not exceptional but good . <sssss> i usually do n't have to ask for a refill on my beverage at the other location , but here i did twice ... the decor of this grimaldi 's is very nice . <sssss> i found myself starring at the ceiling more than once thinking : `` better not bring my bride here ; she 'll want me to do this to our ceiling in the den '' ! <sssss> lunch ~ antipasto salad . <sssss> the fresh mozzarella was very good , oven roasted sweet red peppers were too cold and not seasoned , the salami was sliced very thin and offered only four pieces -lrb- lacking -rrb- , some olives and some fresh baked bread . <sssss> the mozzarella and bread were the stars of this dish ~ everything else let you wanting more or something different . <sssss> personal pizza ~ white garlic with fresh tomatoes . <sssss> for the first time ever i had to add salt to my pizza , what the heck ? <sssss> the crust was full of the deliciousness goodness i 'm used to at grimaldi 's , crispy and scrumptious but the white cheesy and garlicky toppings needed more seasoning ... the calzones my colleagues had were delish and they ate everything in sight including the left over sauce from their calzones . <sssss> i would come back again but for dinner not lunch . <sssss> the bar area seemed to be the place to be in this location . <sssss> this is where you want to sit so you can watch the pizza dough flying before they load it into their brick oven , have some beer or wine but order a different kind of pizza !
?		wowser 's ! <sssss> finally a fantastic place to eat in glendale at la chalet ! <sssss> we had an amazing dinning experience here sunday . <sssss> after reading some of the yelp reviews , i bookmarked this place as a `` must try '' and i 'm so glad i did ! <sssss> we walked in and immediately noticed how cute and quaint this restaurant was decorated . <sssss> there are two sections on the restaurant , a dining room area for families and the other a `` bar and lounge '' area that has a warm ambiance . <sssss> since this trip was a family adventure we were seated right next to the ice cave , where my son could watch the tv 's in the bar area , making the crepes , which was very was very cool . <sssss> they have very entertaining `` french '' signs and posters on the walls . <sssss> they also offer entertainment some nights and have special entertainers scheduled for reservations . <sssss> appetizer : traditional flammenkuchen ~ `` oven roasted tart with sour cream , swiss cheese , bacon and onion '' . <sssss> it looked like a pizza at first , but do n't be fooled ! <sssss> the flavor and texture get you quickly . <sssss> the crispy `` tart '' and unique flavor of the dough itself is enough to party with the sour cream love affair your mouth is having . <sssss> meal : berg ere crepe -lrb- ratatouille with goat cheese melted on top -rrb- , roquefort crepe -lrb- melted blue cheese topped with caramelized apples and crumbled walnuts -rrb- , and a roasted chicken salad -lrb- roasted chicken on a bed of mixed greens , cheeses and a delightful vinaigrette dressing -rrb- . <sssss> they have a decent wine list , great selection of swiss imported ails to try and a full bar . <sssss> desert : chocolate fondue ~ it was fun and entertaining with the kiddo ! <sssss> it was n't too hot and they provide a lot of strawberries , apples , pastry puffs and chocolate brownie wedges for you to dip into the chocolaty goodness ! <sssss> service : was fantastic ! <sssss> our server was able to give us just enough suggestions based on our like/dislikes . <sssss> we had the groupon deal so it made our meal was very inexpensive . <sssss> everything was fresh and fantastic and most of their crepes are gluten free . <sssss> we ca n't wait to go back and try something different .
?		for me it would be more like 3.5 but when it comes to round up , i guess cc deserves the upgrade . <sssss> we ordered everything to the center , as one of our friends likes to say , `` sharing is karing -lrb- typo intended , local joke : -rrb- we had the pork chop , the mushrooms , the porkbelly , mac and cheese , and flat iron steak . <sssss> all the dishes were pretty good . <sssss> the mushrooms had avocado that was ripe and firm -lrb- hard to find a good avocado and they nailed it -rrb- . <sssss> the pork chop was kind of dry , hard and lacked flavor . <sssss> the flat iron steak was good but a little salty . <sssss> the pork belly and mac and cheese were pretty good . <sssss> good wine -lrb- pinot noir from oregon at 15 a glass -rrb- . <sssss> so the food would be a solid 4 stars -lrb- specially because it was n't like crazy expensive considering each one had 2 drinks of our party of 3 -rrb- . <sssss> what i did n't get is why to put so much stuff in a good dish ? <sssss> all the garnishes were plain and uneventful . <sssss> the decor and setting does n't go with the food , from my point of view . <sssss> we were sitting like in the middle , by the bathroom and the kitchen divided by an ugly curtain . <sssss> the service was ok . <sssss> all in all , a good place .
?		ok , i 've never liked any of the fox concepts besides sauce , and i left this place very pleased ! <sssss> maybe the 5 star is a counter balance of how much disappointed i 've been in the past at other places , but this place is great . <sssss> it seems that italian is fox 's strong area . <sssss> the decor is cool , the integrated kitchen is appealing and all in all it 's a great concept . <sssss> i had the cheff 's board , 2 cheeses , 2 meats and some other goodies . <sssss> the ultra thin slices of meat were tasteful and everything was good . <sssss> maybe a little bit of more cheese would n't hurt . <sssss> the pork belly was good . <sssss> not in the amazing side , but pretty decent . <sssss> i ordered spinach tortelloni and it was great , full of flavor and with grana padano , i mean , there 's nothing not to love when it comes to grana padano . <sssss> the desert was n't that great but maybe i was already full . <sssss> the double espresso was good .
?		let 's start with the place . <sssss> beautiful . <sssss> open , comfortable . <sssss> the bar is also great . <sssss> i was waiting at the bar and saw a lot of people having fondue , very elaborated hand crafted cocktails and having a great time . <sssss> when my party arrived we tried several dishes . <sssss> all of them really good . <sssss> i was hoping to try the pork belly but nobody voted for that . <sssss> i 'll be back soon to try it , the fondue and the `` super yummy nuts '' . <sssss> the chopped salad was very good and very unique in flavor and texture . <sssss> the duck ramen was tasteful and with a final spicy kick . <sssss> just be aware , it 's a large serving . <sssss> the wild fiji tuna was also very good . <sssss> the balsamic meatloaf was original and tasteful but again , be aware , the serving is very large . <sssss> i would order it without the rice or it would be good a creamy grana padano risotto , but that 's just my preference . <sssss> my favorite dish was the tomato soup . <sssss> hands down . <sssss> bread pudding was tasteful and the smoke tea chocolate pot the creme was pretty unique . <sssss> i liked it but if you do n't like smoky tastes , this is not for you . <sssss> a great addition to the neighborhood . <sssss> cheers
?		you have to be kidding me ! <sssss> all the buzz about this place is way over rated ! <sssss> the best part of the place is the place itself . <sssss> cool design , innovative , comfortable -lrb- if you overlook the ac running at 65 f -rrb- . <sssss> short and poor selection of wines , the menu does n't make sense , the deserts are poor executed , service barely ok and all of this with a way overpriced tag . <sssss> cheese bread at the beginning was good , probably the best executed dish -lrb- puzzle face -rrb- . <sssss> i had a glass of a french wine which had one of the most awkward wine tastes i 've ever tried , but again , the selection is not that great . <sssss> in their web they have a beet salad but i did n't find it in the menu . <sssss> it seems that they replaced the beets for strawberries . <sssss> when i asked why , apparently beets are out of season . <sssss> -lrb- really ? <sssss> i 'm not a farmer , but i had beets last weekend in another restaurant , oh well -rrb- . <sssss> salad was barely average . <sssss> then i had the marrow bone . <sssss> it was ok , i was expecting a little more of a flavor from the onion jam and the bread used was kind of boring for such a dish . <sssss> for desert i had the rum and coke . <sssss> it should be called sweet bread . <sssss> no taste of rum or coke what so ever . <sssss> just a spongy bread super sweet with whipped cream on the side with an unknown flavor and a jelly with a hint of lime . <sssss> i also tried the doughnuts with chocolate . <sssss> the doughnuts -lrb- bites -rrb- were crunchy -lrb- in a bad way -rrb- and the chocolate was more in the side of dark than milk , so did n't love them either . <sssss> there was a guitar player for all the three tables and 4 people that were at the bar . <sssss> when he was gone , a dj started spinning tunes for the whole 7 tables and 3 people at the bar that were there when i left . <sssss> it will be hard to make me go back ever . <sssss> there 're plenty of places where you will do way better for this kind of money .
?		i ca n't believe this is my first time in this great spot ! <sssss> although i was recovering from a mexican food related stomach problem , i went there with 2 friends of mine . <sssss> the place is great , the patio is awesome and the service could n't be better . <sssss> too bad i did n't ask the waitress her name because i should send a compliment to the place about the great service : -rrb- so i ordered a tea -lrb- i know , it sounds weird but i was sick -rrb- . <sssss> the tea was tasteful and the serving was generous . <sssss> after warming up with the tea and taming my upset stomach , i ordered the filet and the house pinot noir . <sssss> both were pretty good . <sssss> the mountain of mashed potatoes could be smaller and on the side , instead of under the filet and i did n't try the veggies . <sssss> but all in all it was a great experience . <sssss> did i say how awesome the waitress was ? <sssss> i 'll have to go back sooner than later !
?		barely 3 stars . <sssss> this is my 2nd try to this place . <sssss> the first was n't that great , so i took my time to come back and i 'm disappointed again : -lrb- we sat outside . <sssss> what a bad idea . <sssss> the table was next to untrimmed plants and flies were flying around during all the dinner . <sssss> i was craving pork belly and when i ordered , the waiter said that that was the only dish they did n't have . <sssss> great . <sssss> i ordered cheese plate -lrb- which was the best of the night -rrb- , baked potato soup -lrb- lame -rrb- , fillet -lrb- with too much sauce and peppers , plus the spinach had no taste -rrb- and a side of caramelized onion risotto -lrb- which was a little more than ok -rrb- . <sssss> in general good location , nice setting but just lame overpriced food . <sssss> not sure if i 'll be back .
?		this is a hidden gem . <sssss> the great company might influence a little bit in the rating but it deserves every single star . <sssss> the place has a great ambiance with artwork all over the place . <sssss> an open kitchen with the chef cooking and greeting the guests . <sssss> the service was really good and the bathrooms clean -lrb- which , at least for me , is pretty important -rrb- . <sssss> the booth were i sat was unexpectedly deep/plush although very comfortable . <sssss> the house pinoit noir was meh , but no complains . <sssss> the starters were terrific . <sssss> ceviche was tasteful and a nice portion . <sssss> ba mie goreng was also super tasty . <sssss> we shared both dishes so a couple of extra shrimp would be appreciate -lrb- i 'll ask next time for extra shrimp to have 2 per person -rrb- . <sssss> finally i ordered a special , the short rib . <sssss> it was delicious . <sssss> maybe too big of a serving but that 's ok . <sssss> next time i might order more dishes to share since the entrees are pretty big . <sssss> btw , the desert was normal size , which is always appreciated ! <sssss> definitely a must .
?		totally agree with the average rate of 4 stars ! <sssss> let 's start with the location . <sssss> although parking is bad , there 's some relieve with the valet . <sssss> the decor is great , the bar is super cool and in general no complaints at all about the lay out , ambiance , etc. . <sssss> the food is good but not great . <sssss> a little hit and miss -lrb- between good and very good -rrb- . <sssss> the fritto misto was good , the calamari were great , not greasy at all . <sssss> the shrip were good as well . <sssss> the dipping sauce could be better/different though . <sssss> in my opinion it does n't go with the dish . <sssss> the roasted beet salad was pretty good but a little too much onion . <sssss> the agnolotti were interesting but forgettable . <sssss> it seems that all the food is good but nothing to say `` wow '' besides the desert . <sssss> the sweet potato cheesecake is out of this world . <sssss> i would go there just for that ! <sssss> i almost forgot . <sssss> the kids spaghetti with meat sauce is great . <sssss> i might order this the next time . <sssss> the serving is pretty generous so an appetizer and this plus the cheesecake and you 'll be pretty happy . <sssss> definitely a must if your not waiting to be impressed with food . <sssss> a great place to become a regular . <sssss> as a side note it seems that they had an overstock of kale at the kitchen . <sssss> it was everywhere . <sssss> enjoy !
?		the place is pretty comfortable and the prices are n't that bad . <sssss> it 's more a 3.5 i had the bone in rib steak and i ordered it medium . <sssss> as most of the times in almost every place i go , they overcooked it : -lrb- the house pinoit noir was decent and in general the food was pretty good for the money . <sssss> the service was friendly but no refills on the water and the waitress never came back to ask if i would like another glass of wine . <sssss> i would if she asked , but that never happened . <sssss> all in all , a good place to go , not super expensive and ok service .
?		the sushi was not good enough , to me , to make up for the table next to me . <sssss> there was a large table of about 10 people , probably in their early to mid 20s , and they had been enjoying quite a few alcoholic beverages . <sssss> now i 'll never hate on anyone for that , but they were being stupid and annoying . <sssss> one guy at the table threw his water glass into the aisle - twice . <sssss> broke two glasses . <sssss> i kept waiting for the staff to kick him out . <sssss> they cleaned up the glass and did n't say a word to this a $ $ . <sssss> i was in shock that they did n't even speak to him about his behavior . <sssss> acting like a destructive child . <sssss> ya know , i realize they 're running a business , and they had a large table , but it 's offensive to me that they did n't speak to him to protect their other paying patrons . <sssss> and this is why i 'm not going back to stingray . <sssss> plus - they have fishies in the floor . <sssss> i 'm concerned for the fishies ' welfare . <sssss> remember when you a kid and your mom told you not to tap on the fish aquarium because the fish do n't like it ? <sssss> i wonder how they like the tap dance that the foyer floor gets nightly : - -lrb-
?		los sombreros is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley . <sssss> the food is always just perfect . <sssss> the prices are extremely reasonable . <sssss> i modeled my own guacamole recipe after theirs , it 's that good . <sssss> try the specials of the day , they 're always great . <sssss> the service has been a little hit & miss for me . <sssss> most of the time they 're fine . <sssss> there 's this one woman who is extremely unfriendly . <sssss> i think she just does n't like me : -- rrb - but ya know , with food & ambiance like this , it does n't bother me if i occasionally end up with a cranky server !
?		this place is pretty much packed all the time . <sssss> i have tried going on tuesday nights , wednesday nights - you can get a table , usually , but it 's still really busy . <sssss> i avoid it completely on friday & saturday nights now . <sssss> people spend 2 hours at the bar waiting for their table and by the time dinner comes they 're loaded . <sssss> it 's something you only want to deal with if you 're drunk yourself . <sssss> the sushi is incredibly hit and miss here . <sssss> i 've been there and had tuna sashimi that was just perfect , and the next time i go back it 's so awful i ca n't eat it . <sssss> so i do n't go here for sushi anymore . <sssss> i like the teppanyaki tables where they cook in front of you . <sssss> i 'm a huge fan of the sea bass . <sssss> the kobe beef is also fantastic ... when i can afford it ! <sssss> lol i think the teppanyaki food is very well done and that 's what i get when i come here . <sssss> other great dishes are the kobe burger , and the wasabi shrimp cocktail .
?		three words : chicken chopped salad . <sssss> i could eat this salad everyday for the rest of my life . <sssss> absolutely delicious . <sssss> the turkey burger is also just as great . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back & try more dishes as well as the juices !
?		same as my review of their biltmore location -lrb- yum -rrb- . <sssss> last weekend i went for brunch after yoga on the fountains . <sssss> i ordered the egg & sweet potato hash which was a ton of food . <sssss> i also ordered the kale smoothie which was n't fabulous , but healthy , which was what i was going for .
?		you ca n't go wrong - or leave completely stuffed - at the melting pot . <sssss> i was excited for the living social deal a couple months ago for 3 courses -lrb- cheese , salad , endless entree -rrb- plus a champagne toast for a fraction of the cost . <sssss> this particular location has a ton of `` lover 's lane '' seating - a tiny table for 2 with the option to close curtains for privacy . <sssss> i 've never had even remotely average service - it 's always been top-notch . <sssss> the food is obviously incredible as well . <sssss> i love how dinner takes 2 hours here because 4 courses sure is a lot of food . <sssss> great date spot !
?		i went to menchies for the first time this week & thought it was pretty good . <sssss> i liked that they had sample cups out in the open ; some other shops i 've been to seem to be quite stingy with them . <sssss> the flavors they had were pretty unique as well . <sssss> i mixed mango & coconut tart together and headed to the toppings bar . <sssss> not the biggest by any means , but had just what i needed . <sssss> save 10 % by checking in on yelp !
?		great choice for lunch in phoenix ! <sssss> i ordered the pad thai which was the perfect amount of spice . <sssss> i 've never finished an entire plate at a thai restaurant , but i did here . <sssss> the portion was decent but not gigantic like other restaurants in the area . <sssss> everyone 's food looked fabulous at our table , i ca n't wait to try more !
?		i 'm a sucker for restaurants/chefs that have been featured on the food network or top chef . <sssss> i 'm also a sucker for a hearty breakfast . <sssss> over easy fits the bill for both . <sssss> we arrived around 10:30 a & only had to wait about 10 minutes . <sssss> i ordered the tammy -lrb- egg whites with spinach , swiss cheese , garlic and onion on an english muffin -rrb- & ryan ordered the cheddar-jalapeno biscuits & sausage gravy . <sssss> next time i 'm getting those waffle dogs . <sssss> my sandwich was delish & the sweet potato tater tots were amazing . <sssss> big portion but definitely doable if you 're hungry . <sssss> i tried some of ryan 's plate & it was phenomenal . <sssss> we were on the hunt in minneapolis for the best biscuits & gravy and this place would have won that competition . <sssss> this is the type of place i 'll bring visitors to so they think i 'm in the know : -rrb-
?		i went to zoe 's kitchen for lunch last week & had a great meal . <sssss> i ordered the chicken salad & fruit plate which was pretty big . <sssss> by the time i ate the chicken salad & fruit i was so full i could n't eat the remaining greens . <sssss> they have a ton of soup , salad , sandwich & hummus options - ca n't wait to try more !
?		i love trader joe 's . <sssss> i went here to explore the -lrb- limited -rrb- card collection . <sssss> most were actually pretty good . <sssss> it was a little more crowded than other stores but it also had some unique plants like succulents that were just adorable !
?		i came here for a free dental ce which in and of itself was amazing . <sssss> flemming 's has a nice private room so we could here the speaker well , -lrb- downs for hosting , a little trouble with the lights and watch for next door clickers taking over your screen -rrb- . <sssss> the food was fabulous . <sssss> shrimp cocktail , interesting butters and bread , red onion walnut cranberry salad : pretty standard . <sssss> then things became interesting . <sssss> my favorite kind of mac and cheese coating in panko bread crumbs , perfectly cooked and seasoned asparagus , and melt in your mouth filet mignon . <sssss> i did not think i would be able to eat another bite but out came a huge slice of i believe white chocolate cheesecake with a berry sauce . <sssss> amazing ! <sssss> i wanted more sauce but that was not enough to stop me from cleaning my plate . <sssss> why is n't there free ce 's with fantastic dinners that allow over eager dental students every night ???
?		i loved this place ! <sssss> cute christmas lights , indoor and outdoor seating -lrb- with heat lamps -rrb- , and delicious -lrb- and strong -rrb- limoncello . <sssss> fabulous date night . <sssss> my boyfriend 's calzone was clearly burnt to a crisp on the top , which he took off . <sssss> when the waitress came by to ask about the meal , he told her and she just said sorry . <sssss> a little disappointing , but the freshness of the ingredients sang to me and my little pizza was perfect with asian pear , arugula , and gorgonzola . <sssss> i liked it so much i had the left overs for breakfast the next day . <sssss> i would love to go back . <sssss> the crust also had the perfect bite and flavor . <sssss> yum !
?		love nordstrom rack . <sssss> good prices and good quality products . <sssss> great organization/selection .
?		cute chinese pancake vendor outside , delicious looking americanized pastries at the bakery , a quick fast food section like the other ranch markets but asian , and great produce/prepared foods at good prices . <sssss> no indian section like asiana market , but i am definitely a fan ... now to learn chinese so i can understand labels
?		i think buca is actually a pretty great place as long as you follow the formula : bring online $ 10 off coupon bring a good group of friends who will share 4 + be flexible came here for a white elephant christmas lunch with 11 people . <sssss> ordered cheesy garlic bread , meaty salad , two types of rigatoni , eggplant parm , and proscuitto stuffed chicken . <sssss> only leftovers for one serving of pasta . <sssss> success ! <sssss> everyone was happy , full , enjoyed making fun of the creepy rotating pope head on the table for sharing , and were well catered to by multiple staff . <sssss> my water was always 1/2 full : -rrb- final tab under $ 20 a person with drinks and over 20 % tip -lrb- they do n't add gratuity too which i love ! <sssss> -rrb- music was the perfect level too which i do n't think should be undervalued . <sssss> no shouting to be heard but not so quiet the whole restaurant could hear our conversation . <sssss> buca can be a good time as long as you come prepared !
?		very crowded on a weekday lunch and i can see why ! <sssss> largest quesadillas i have ever seen . <sssss> loved the corn tortillas . <sssss> the burrito in enchilada sauce was also good but smaller than the quesadilla ! <sssss> i ate half of the del rey torta and it was good but the chips that accompany are boring . <sssss> the tres leches could also be better . <sssss> next time i want to try one of the fruity drinks .
?		lately i find my tastes changing . <sssss> these changes ambush me without warning : not long ago i stopped putting splenda in my tea - cold turkey . <sssss> i started liking pastrami instead of corned beef . <sssss> i stopped watching the news on tv . <sssss> is this a function of aging ? <sssss> i do n't know . <sssss> one of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall `` character '' of a restaurant . <sssss> i find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable , or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way . <sssss> it does n't have to be fancy - but it ca n't be gloomy and boring . <sssss> this was brought home to me today at lunch . <sssss> our friend sue picked a place i had never been to - spinato 's pizza . <sssss> it 's a family owned and run local chain with four locations . <sssss> we went to the one at bell and 16th street . <sssss> sue brought along her friend/employer lee . <sssss> it happens that lee 's grandson works in spinato 's kitchen . <sssss> he always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family . <sssss> the place is cute - decorated in red , green and white . <sssss> there are striped awnings above the booths , and trellises with vines . <sssss> the chairs are white with green -lrb- or red -rrb- seats , and the table tops are white with the spinato logo in the corners . <sssss> the patio has tables with red-checked cloths . <sssss> we were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks . <sssss> ken and i ordered a large spicy italian pie -lrb- $ 19.50 -rrb- with added ricotta . <sssss> we also got a salad -lrb- $ 3.99 -rrb- . <sssss> lee requested garlic bread -lrb- $ 3.99 , $ 4.79 with cheese -rrb- , and a small spinach calzone , one of the house specialties -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . <sssss> sue got spinach too , but in the form of a `` lil '' -lrb- smaller than small -rrb- pizza -lrb- $ 7.50 -rrb- . <sssss> the salads arrived first , notable mostly for their large size . <sssss> while the ingredients were fresh , there was nothing exciting there . <sssss> the olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality . <sssss> the garlic bread , eight pieces in the order , was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter . <sssss> you have to make sure that everyone you 'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too . <sssss> the staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy . <sssss> the pizzas were served on a wire rack , a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp . <sssss> instead of slices , our pie was cut into many small squares . <sssss> i found that for some reason this caused me to eat less . <sssss> the pizza was n't loaded down with sauce , and it had plenty of toppings . <sssss> i tasted sue 's spinach pie and it was really good . <sssss> the spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza , and there 's tons of fresh garlic . <sssss> lee 's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home . <sssss> the menu is n't extensive . <sssss> besides the pizzas -lrb- 10 varieties , plus design your own -rrb- and calzone -lrb- there 's a spaghetti and meatball one -rrb- there are two pastas and five sandwiches . <sssss> we did n't inquire about dessert . <sssss> the story behind spinato 's is told on the back of the menu . <sssss> the family was worried that when they left chicago for phoenix , back in the `` 70 's , they would n't be able to find good pizza . <sssss> what choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor ?! <sssss> as the family grew so did the number of parlors . <sssss> while the prices are n't low , you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25 % off the entire bill coupon . <sssss> are n't coupons great !! <sssss> i have to say that if i was doing a blind taste-test between stumpy 's pizza -lrb- see the archives -rrb- and spinato 's , i 'd probably give the nod to stumpy 's . <sssss> but if you add in those other factors which have become important to me , as a dining destination spinato 's wins . <sssss> it 's also won awards from phoenix new times , the scottsdale culinary festival and city search .
?		i know a lot of you will disagree with me , but i have to be honest with you , i 've never been a fan of sam fox concept restaurants , mostly because the emphasis is on the concept , not the food . <sssss> and they tend to be outrageously expensive . <sssss> the exceptions are sauce , which in my opinion serves insipid food , the counter -lrb- it 's 25 cent coffee was the deal of the decade -rrb- and the new zinburger . <sssss> of course , zinburger is easy on the eyes , with it 's huge mural of happy cows , and it 's lighthearted use of chartreuse accents . <sssss> given that it 's in the the biltmore fashion park , $ 8-14 for various types of burgers is n't bad - and they 're big enough to share . <sssss> sides of french fries , fried zucchini , etc. are $ 3-5 , and salads range from $ 9-14 . <sssss> there are lots of milkshakes and floats at around $ 6 . <sssss> the trouble , as i see it , is that you can get better for less bucks at indulge or bluburger -lrb- particularly if you use a coupon -rrb- . <sssss> delux is a little less expensive , with a lot more food options , although the ambience is n't as pleasant . <sssss> i wo n't bore you with what we ate , suffice to say it was merely okay . <sssss> my favorite thing is the irony . <sssss> zinburger , with it 's emphasis on meat , sits a few doors down from sam fox 's tru , which specializes in being vegetarian and vegan friendly .
?		if you find yourself in downtown scottsdale at lunchtime you might drop in at don & charlie 's , the sports memorabilia paradise which incidentally serves really good steaks , chops and ribs . <sssss> the main restaurant is n't open , but the lounge hosts the burger bar from 11:30 to 2:30 pm . <sssss> the menu is small . <sssss> there are a few appetizers - guacamole -lrb- not the best in town -rrb- and a cabo style shrimp cocktail -lrb- $ 6.95 -rrb- which i 've heard is quite good . <sssss> a few salads - chicken caesar and mediterranean with chicken , both $ 8.95 . <sssss> they looked tasty and were quite large . <sssss> and a few uninspiring sounding sandwiches . <sssss> the real reason to come here is the burgers ; big , juicy and cooked to order -lrb- even if the menu says differently -rrb- . <sssss> the basic burger is $ 7.95 , and nine variations are listed -lrb- all $ 8.95 -rrb- , but you can create your own for the same price . <sssss> slaw is served alongside . <sssss> but , get this , for $ 1.95 you can get a huge plate of delicious onion `` strings '' . <sssss> i do n't know why they 're called strings , which are often dry and overcooked . <sssss> these are basically onion rings which have been cut open so they 're not round -lrb- again , i have no idea why -rrb- . <sssss> fries are the same price , or you can have half and half . <sssss> the other reason to go to the burger bar is the broasted chicken . <sssss> this is half a chicken deep-fried in a pressure cooker . <sssss> according to the explanation on the menu , `` pressure frying seals in the flavors and seals out the oil '' . <sssss> ken will attest to this . <sssss> the chicken was nice and crispy , not greasy and not salty . <sssss> and the price was right - $ 9.95 for a serving size that runs at least $ 16 almost anywhere else . <sssss> a word of caution . <sssss> the chicken is n't pre-cooked -lrb- thank heavens -rrb- so it takes 20 minutes to a half hour to reach your table . <sssss> there 's a mini creme brulee -lrb- $ 1.95 -rrb- for dessert . <sssss> this lone little offering struck me as very funny . <sssss> while you 're waiting for your chicken you can walk around and look for artifacts from you favorite team . <sssss> it 's a fun place and a most reasonable price for lunch .
?		a few days ago my favorite restaurant blogger , seth chadwick , wrote about a dim sum place with a twist - no carts . <sssss> instead you check off items on a printed menu , much like those in many sushi places , with an accompanying page of photos of the various dishes . <sssss> i thought this was a great idea since i 've always been intimidated by the servers who push the cart up to your table and try to force unwanted dishes on you . <sssss> china chan is at the metro center , a place we seldom go . <sssss> the freestanding building is unprepossessing , to say the least , as is the interior . <sssss> a few sad lanterns hang from the ceiling . <sssss> that 's about it for ambience . <sssss> but the servers are very nice , and those who speak english are happy to make suggestions and give explanations of the various dishes . <sssss> there are 28 dim sum dishes at $ 1.80 each including spareribs with black bean sauce , baked bbq pork buns , and tripe with ginger and scallions . <sssss> at $ 2.85 you can get steamed lotus flavor rice , pan fried rice noodles with dried shrimp , and 7 others . <sssss> next are those at $ 3.55 ; steamed shrimp filled rice noodles , beef tripe , chinese broccoli and shrimp roll steamed rice noodle . <sssss> finally , the chef 's specials , eight of them , are priced from $ 5.99 to $ 8.50 . <sssss> from this last group we chose roast pork and roast duck . <sssss> we also selected daikon cakes -lrb- i know these as turnip cakes -rrb- at $ 1.80 . <sssss> lastly , from the regular menu we ordered eggplant in garlic sauce . <sssss> our waitress , licking her lips , suggested we add beef to the dish and that we pour lots of chili oil on top . <sssss> the roast pork and daikon arrived first . <sssss> chunks of moist , slowly roasted pork were generously sprinkled with the cracklings of skin . <sssss> decadent . <sssss> and the portion was huge . <sssss> the daikon cakes , three large rectangles enough to serve 6 as part of a meal , were the silkiest i 've had , with just enough pan fry crust to satisfy . <sssss> a small bowl of hoisin was served alongside . <sssss> then the duck and eggplant were served . <sssss> the eggplant sauce was quite mild -lrb- our server was right about the chili oil -rrb- but beautifully flavored and the beef slices were a great addition . <sssss> again , the serving was huge . <sssss> i do n't recall how much this cost , but the dishes from the menu are remarkably low priced . <sssss> the only thing not stellar was the roast duck . <sssss> the skin was n't crackly , and there was lots of fat . <sssss> both menus contained dishes you do n't often find , and there were lots of asian diners , so china chans felt like the real deal . <sssss> i suggest you go there with lots of people so you can sample a great variety of dim sum . <sssss> give us a call - we 're ready to go !!
?		a great place to come for a romantic dinner . <sssss> absolutely love the pretzel bites with provolone dip . <sssss> you can sit in a booth and watch a basketball game in a fun & hip environment . <sssss> there is also bar seating , where a lot of people seem to come after work . <sssss> the decor , like at all sam fox concepts , is impeccably done . <sssss> the service this time around was great - our waiter was so attentive , funny and thoughtful , as was the rest of the staff . <sssss> it makes for a stress-free and totally fun night out .
?		on our 5-year anniversary , i had hoped for a slightly better experience . <sssss> * plus sides : fantastic fondue appetizer great crumb-topped mac n ' cheese in a cute silver dish wonderful blackberry lemonade servers were accomodating to our desire to change seats charming and open concept patio cute ice cream shop next door * down sides : 1 -rrb- valet parking almost gave me a heart attack . <sssss> first there was a long wait to get to the booth , where there were pedestrians meandering in the car line . <sssss> then , once we passed off our car to the valet man , we heard an ear-piercing shriek coming from our car as it was being driven away . <sssss> my husband guesses that he did not pull out the emergency break . <sssss> it was a little scary . <sssss> not a great way to start the evening , although i 'm sure it was a mistake . <sssss> 2 -rrb- interior a bit dark and overly masculine for my taste , especially where we were originally seated , crammed into a corner . <sssss> hence the desire to be moved . <sssss> 3 -rrb- music was not very enchanting . <sssss> rather , it was a lot of early-2000 's radio hits -lrb- think nickelback or linkin park -rrb- . <sssss> it did not match when we were seated in a fancy , beautifully-appointed outdoor patio . <sssss> i would suggest something lighter or more romantic . <sssss> so , overall : great food but the atmosphere needs a little work .
?		i am going to update my review according to some more recent experiences . <sssss> the staff has been a bit more brusque with me lately , especially over the phone when pre-ordering lunch . <sssss> also , since i became vegetarian i have been ordering my favorite sandwich but without meat - this has seemed to cause issues and my last sandwich was sloppy and thrown-together looking , even though it is essentially just a grilled cheese sandwich . <sssss> why is that so difficult ? <sssss> acacia cafe , you have disappointed me .
?		beautiful , charming farm with 2 restaurants on the premises . <sssss> lots of beautiful crops , pecan trees , awnings and pergolas to drool over . <sssss> there 's even a chicken coop ! <sssss> i honestly could spend all day here . <sssss> i wish i had known about this place when planning my wedding , it 's absolutely gorgeous .
?		i 'm not a big coffee drinker myself - lately i have just been getting iced tea . <sssss> but a little secret about this place - their gluten free chocolate chip & peanut butter cookies are to die for . <sssss> i seriously crave these little babies all the time . <sssss> they are so moist , dense and sweet . <sssss> they taste like cookie dough but they are entirely gluten free ! <sssss> i love that this place is hip and in the middle of the first friday happenings . <sssss> i can walk here from my apartment , which is an added plus . <sssss> only knocking off a star because the seating options are sometimes underwhelming . <sssss> definitely more seating than lola down the street , but sometimes the space is inefficiently used with one person per table . <sssss> there is always outside seating -lrb- but it 's so darn hot ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		some friends of ours had been trying to convince us to come to cyclo -lrb- pronounced sick-lo -rrb- for a couple of months , and i 'm so glad we did . <sssss> all the food was fresh , and very authentic , according to our friend who has been to vietnam . <sssss> the spicy green beans were amazing , i could eat them like french fries . <sssss> i had the pad thai with tofu for my entree and it was so good ! <sssss> the noodles tasted freshly made , the tofu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside , and the sauce was not overly peanutty or overpowering . <sssss> my hubby had a giant bowl of pho soup , which he thoroughly enjoyed . <sssss> i liked that they had so many vegetarian options . <sssss> as for the ambiance , i really enjoyed it . <sssss> the lighting , decor and music was happy and modern . <sssss> we met the owner , justine , and i was actually scared to meet her based on the previous reviews i had read on yelp . <sssss> well , turns out the reviews could n't have been more wrong . <sssss> she is sweet and personable and she lightheartedly joked with our table . <sssss> she gracefully floated throughout the tables the whole night , making people laugh and making sure they were taken care of . <sssss> in my opinion , more owners should be this way , because it shows that they really care about their customers and their experience . <sssss> bottomline : i will definitely come back !
?		this is the type of restaurant you only go to once . <sssss> i have now been there twice - once at the old location , once at the new one . <sssss> the reason you only go there once ? <sssss> holy wait time , batman . <sssss> i 'm sorry , but there has to be a way to make the seating more efficient . <sssss> when you 're hungry , there 's nothing worse than 30-60 minute wait times , or a giant party of 15 people who arrive later than you do and they get to `` squeeze in '' . <sssss> although matt 's has just upgraded to a new , bigger space , this still is n't the type of restaurant that should be accommodating 15-person groups -lrb- aka almost the entire dining area -rrb- . <sssss> we went here for my husband 's birthday on a friday morning . <sssss> after waiting about 45 minutes , we were next on the list but got bumped to the uncomfortable street-facing counter seats , when at that very moment there were three empty two-top tables , completely set with silverware and everything . <sssss> we asked if we could be seated there instead , but were turned down by the host , because they were being reserved for the aforementioned party . <sssss> my husband was having trouble with knee pain that morning and the counter seats did not physically accommodate his needs , so we asked our waitress if there was anywhere else we could sit . <sssss> again , we were turned down . <sssss> i was getting a little flustered , not the way you want to feel on your loved one 's birthday . <sssss> we considered leaving , even after we ordered our food . <sssss> eventually , they did allow us to sit at a two-top , which i appreciated . <sssss> the food was the only redeeming quality , but again i was too flustered to truly enjoy it . <sssss> i got the cheese omelette with hash browns . <sssss> very good , although hash browns were a greasy , mushy mess . <sssss> my husband got a ham scramble of some kind . <sssss> we had a side of rye toast , which was tasty . <sssss> beverages were served in cute little jam jars . <sssss> pros : food , decor , charm , ambience , supporting a local endeavor cons : the most hyper-inflated wait time and some of the worst seating options of any restaurant i 've ever known . <sssss> the take-out option sounds nice , and would eliminate a lot of my frustrations .
?		from what i remember -lrb- it has been a few months -rrb- , the food was ok , and the ambience was quite lovely . <sssss> it 's a converted historic home , so it definitely has a lot of charm . <sssss> there is handmade art on the walls -lrb- some much better than others -rrb- . <sssss> it does have an odd layout with many different room/levels , which again is a part of the aforementioned charm . <sssss> the food/drinks did not blow me away , so i have not been back there since , but i would be willing to give this place another shot , especially since they just put up a new shade-providing gazebo on the patio , something they desperately needed . <sssss> once the weather cools down i start loving quirky little places like this again : -rrb-
?		i went to jason 's deli on a recommendation from friends , knowing that i 'm a soup/salad/sandwich-type food lover . <sssss> but , i 'd say that i 'm pretty picky about which places i like , because if you 're going to get me to pay $ 7 for a sandwich , it better be darn good . <sssss> jason 's deli was good . <sssss> i 'd definitely go again . <sssss> i had a half ham & swiss on french bread and a cup of their cheddar broccoli soup . <sssss> yummy . <sssss> they also have a huge salad bar that i 'd like to try out on my next visit . <sssss> downside - all sandwiches come with a handful of potato chips . <sssss> wondering if they have any alternative for those of us not a fan of greasy chips ? <sssss> will find out on the next trip ps , outdoor seating , ftw
?		went for a weekday lunch with the boyfriend because this place was so highly recommended by matt s -lrb- who is currently `` the duke '' here on yelp 's new check-in app -rrb- . <sssss> we barely found this place because it 's tucked into the corner of a strip mall , right next to a pet groomer and a preschool/daycare . <sssss> once we walked in , we noticed that they have a covered patio as well as indoor dining . <sssss> the tables are covered in butchers block paper -lrb- and they gave markers to the tables with kids ... although none for me ? <sssss> hmmmm ... i am a kid at heart . <sssss> note : i shall ask for markers next time -rrb- . <sssss> i ordered the deli sub -lrb- ham , salami , and peperoni adorned with veggies , oils , and mayo -rrb- . <sssss> #nom . <sssss> this sandwich was huge , which was maybe my biggest complaint . <sssss> i literally could not smash the sandwich down enough to fit it in my mouth ... i had to pull a bit of the meat off , which made me feel sad for those slices of delicious meaty goodness . <sssss> for my side , i ordered the pasta salad , which was good -lrb- maybe too many onions for my taste , but still good -rrb- . <sssss> and , for dessert , i ordered a scoop of their homemade ice cream - brown sugar & cinnamon flavor . <sssss> double #nom . <sssss> the service was great . <sssss> our waitress was very attentive , checking back on us several times throughout the meal . <sssss> the 2 other staff that were there at the time also pitched in by clearing plates , which shows that they are a great time and they were laughing with each other which makes for a great atmosphere .
?		i 've been to teakwoods a couple different times and have enjoyed myself each and every time . <sssss> my last visit was one of the most memorable . <sssss> we were there in large group and they ran out of the larger draft glasses on the last 2 of us -lrb- me and my boyfriend -rrb- . <sssss> so , they brought us each out a mini-pitcher full of beer and charged us for the glass . <sssss> amazing ! <sssss> the service is great - quick and friendly and with peanuts on the table , you ca n't go wrong . <sssss> inside , it 's your standard local bar -lrb- with peanut shells all over the floor -rrb- . <sssss> and , on the outside , it 's tucked inside a strip mall with ample parking .
?		i went to heart attack grill after seeing it in the national nursing media headlines -lrb- they were putting this place down for creating a demeaning/sexualized view of nurses -rrb- . <sssss> so , of course , i had to go and see what the fuss was about . <sssss> i walked in to the very small location , to find only 2 other tables with customers -lrb- older , unhygienic , obese men -rrb- . <sssss> the two waitresses on staff were less than appealing -lrb- and i 'm the kind of girl that can look at an attractive woman and admit it -rrb- and the `` cook '' behind the counter , in the scrubs/doctor uniform looked like his clothes and hair had n't been washed in more than a week . <sssss> went ahead and ordered anyways . <sssss> their menu consists of 4 burgers -lrb- single , double , tripple , or quadruple bypass bugers -rrb- , flatliner fries , and soda ... but no diet soda . <sssss> oh , you can also order a pack of camel filterless cigarettes if your stash is running low . <sssss> i ordered a single bypass burger , flatliner fries , and a coke . <sssss> the burger was sub-par ... very greasy and the fries were soggy and half cooked . <sssss> the only positive thing i have to say is that i enjoyed drinking a coke out of a cold glass bottle . <sssss> i 'd rather go to hooters to see hot , half-dressed chicks ... and i 'd rather go ummmmm ... anywhere else to eat .
?		i love piano bars ... i ca n't say that i 've had a bad time anytime i 've been to one , but the atmosphere at the big bang might have been my least favorite out of the ones i 've been to . <sssss> we went on a friday night and it was beyond crowded ... we could n't get anywhere near the pianos . <sssss> heck , it was a loooong wait to get into the bathroom . <sssss> and , once we did get into the bathroom , we found out that there was only one usable stall because there were college girls puking in the other stalls - guess that 's a hazard of going out around asu . <sssss> they did have good drink deals and the piano players were great . <sssss> i 'd like to go again , but probably not on a friday or saturday night .
?		bj 's is one of my favorite restaurants in the east valley -lrb- and i 'm shocked to read the negative reviews done before mine -rrb- . <sssss> over the last 2 years , i 've probably been there for a few dozen visits with my biggest complaint being that they are extremely busy during your common weekend meal hours . <sssss> the servers have always been more than attentive and will even offer free samples of their made-in-house microbrews if you seem unsure of your beer selection . <sssss> personally , i get excited each fall for their seasonal selection called `` nitwit '' - it 's a wheat beer , similar to a hef , with a hint of orange just gives it a unique coloring and taste . <sssss> they have many options for meals , with some of my favorites being their salads -lrb- very large size , i have yet to finish one -rrb- , their baked potatoes -lrb- over a pound , then stuffed with your favorites -rrb- , chicago-style stuffed pizza , and signaure sandwiches -lrb- the crispy chicken is my favorite , by far -rrb- . <sssss> and , of course , you ca n't pass up dessert at bj 's - they have pizzookies . <sssss> for anyone who might not have already been introduced , a pizzookie is a big cookie -lrb- in a personal pizza sized pan -rrb- , baked to be slightly gooey with a couple scoops of ice cream on top .
?		love love love this place . <sssss> i have been to roy 's at many locations and especially enjoyed the roy 's on maui , but this is one of my favorites . <sssss> this place is amazing with a reoccurring hawaiian theme , whats not to love ! <sssss> it is a mix of european techniques and asian cuisine while meeting hawaiian hospitality . <sssss> honestly , i love the seared ahi tuna and get this dish most of the times come . <sssss> but when i decide to change it up , i am never disappointed . <sssss> for the appetizers we loved the crunchy golden lobster pot-stickers , for the salads we loved the roasted beet salad and grilled pear salad and for the entrees -lrb- besides the ahi tuna -rrb- the crab dynamite baked barramundi is delicious -lrb- a little rich so be prepared -rrb- , the mahi mahi and hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish is absolutely mouth watering !!! <sssss> if you are reading this , you must go and try : -rrb- i also heard from one of my friends that the filet mignon is one of the best around . <sssss> i have not had the chance yet to give it a whirl . <sssss> so maybe a surf & turf next ? <sssss> last but not least is the dessert . <sssss> this may be my favorite at any restaurant out there . <sssss> roy 's chocolate souffle . <sssss> a delicious chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and a tad of raspberry sauce - it literally melts in your mouth . <sssss> this is a must , make sure you order it ! <sssss> remember , there is always room for dessert ! <sssss> monday nights are usually a fix priced 3-course menu , so you should check it out . <sssss> great deal if they still offer . <sssss> my friend and i have dined here many times and we have had some issues in the past with take-out food , so make sure your order is correct before leaving . <sssss> aloha !
?		this place always popped up as a high-rated restaurant on yelp and after reading all the reviews , i decided to give it a try . <sssss> first of all , like everyone says this place is a true hideaway , there are no signs . <sssss> it is very small with only a couple tables , with dim lighting and rich wood as the decor . <sssss> second , it is a delicious new mexican/tex mex place . <sssss> as soon as you walk in the door , you smell the smoker and all the delicious flavors . <sssss> our waiter was awesome , gave us very helpful tips on the menu and portion size . <sssss> the meals are very large , extremely hot and impossible to go finish unless you come on a very empty stomach . <sssss> my friend and i both tried the carne adovada , which is n't your typical mexican but it sure was yummy . <sssss> the pork is so soft and it is marinated for hours in a rich chili sauce , you can really taste the smoker - it is so overpowering ! <sssss> let me just say , the beans served with the carne were some of the best beans ever . <sssss> this is by far some of the best southwestern cuisine i have ever eaten ! <sssss> next time , i would really like to try some other dishes !!
?		this place is just gross . <sssss> but a good place to watch sports and that 's it . <sssss> food is horrible . <sssss> sometimes i am forced to come here for lunch during the work week . <sssss> is it bad when you do n't want to order one thing off the menu ??! <sssss> i will give props to the outdoor patio area but this place is just a straight up bar . <sssss> there are many tv 's for viewing and shouting , whichever you prefer .
?		pizza is not to shabby here . <sssss> i like it better than bianco and in some ways is comparable to a new york slice . <sssss> but definitely a good decision to check out cibo if you 're in the mood for a good pizza in phoenix ! <sssss> one key to good pizza is the dough and the crust is soft ! <sssss> great atmosphere , ambiance , quaint any time of the year . <sssss> love the outdoor seating on the patio with fire areas , live music and an assortment of lights . <sssss> service was okay , i had an empty water the whole meal . <sssss> i would definitely come back here and try some other pizzas and maybe an entree . <sssss> for dessert , we had the strawberry banana crepe with nutella - i mean a crepe with chcoclate , yum . <sssss> but they were out of their other chocolate dessert : -lrb- let me rewind back to appetizer , caprese salad is enough for a handful of people . <sssss> the mozzarella tossed with pesto , oregano , evoo , chopped fresh basil and grape tomatoes is absolutely scrumptious . <sssss> check it out !
?		always come here for lunch except in the summer when they are closed . <sssss> i mean , at over 100 degrees f , it gets hot on a farm ! <sssss> you can always find fresh food at the farm kitchen and its a great atmosphere for lunch . <sssss> does not feel like you are in phoenix ! <sssss> there is a cute sitting area outside the kitchen and a bunch of picnic tables throughout the grounds . <sssss> tons of greenery and beautiful landscape you do n't normally see in the phoenix area . <sssss> it is great to come over here on a weekend with a blanket and have a picnic out on the grass . <sssss> if you need to relax and rewind , i highly recommended checking this place out - you wo n't regret it ! <sssss> sandwiches are great -lrb- chicken bltda -rrb- and so are salads , they are pre-made and sit on ice at the kitchen . <sssss> morning glory has great reviews for breakfast/lunch and i have yet to make it over there . <sssss> and as of now , i still have quiessence bookmarked on my list ready to try !
?		went there for lunch today ... i was craving a burger when a coworker suggested this place . <sssss> it was exactly what i was looking for . <sssss> the sliders reminded my of a place that i frequented in hackensack , nj called white mana ... the sliders that chicago hamburger co served were delicious . <sssss> i am not from the midwest , but this jersey girl did enjoy a little taste of chicago today !
?		i am so excited that baseball season has started !! <sssss> well , not officially , but spring training is giving a little taste of the upcoming season . <sssss> i was just at the phoenix municipal stadium to see the la dodgers play the chicago white soxs . <sssss> the stadium was great to watch the ballgame . <sssss> we sat behind home plate , the seats were comfortable and the beer was cold ... what else do you need on a sunny afternoon ?
?		if you do n't know where lon 's happens to be , you can drive right past it ... as i did . <sssss> as i walked into the restaurant , i first had to walk through the beautiful patio . <sssss> . <sssss> wishing that my party had reserved to sit out there , but greatful we did not because it had to be scottsdale coldest evening in a year ! <sssss> the ambiance of the restaurant was great , yes it was romantic but yet still inviting for larger parties . <sssss> we had a bottle of champagne and pinot noir which was recommended by the sommelier . <sssss> for dinner , i had the pan roasted alaskan halibut and the truffle scented mac and cheese ... the halibut was nicely prepared and had a wonderful flavor . <sssss> the truffle scented mac and cheese was cold and not as tasteful as i hoped . <sssss> it was a disappointment . <sssss> for desert , we decided on the chocolate cake with vanilla malt . <sssss> overall , lon 's was a nice dining experience . <sssss> the only reason i would go back to the restaurant is for the outdoor patio .
?		yes , this has dropped to a single star for me after our last experience . <sssss> we went in for a weekday lunch , so it was n't super busy . <sssss> i 'd say the quality of the food is the same . <sssss> what caused the change ? <sssss> the german cockroach climbing the wall behind us . <sssss> this was n't a sewer roach . <sssss> when your house becomes infested with roaches , these are the roaches you find . <sssss> there is never just one , and the fact that it was in the dining area has it a little too close to the food prep area -lrb- which is smack in the middle of the dining room -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm not generally one to generally worry about a bug or two . <sssss> flies come in through the door , etc. . <sssss> roaches are a different matter entirely . <sssss> our last visit was just that ... our last visit .
?		this was a tricky review to write . <sssss> i really wanted to like this place , it came so highly recommended , but my experience was less than ideal . <sssss> we went on a thursday for their $ 25 couples menu . <sssss> i 'll start at the beginning ... the hostess seated us . <sssss> that was it . <sssss> no menus , nothing . <sssss> just seated us . <sssss> ok . <sssss> fine . <sssss> i assumed that meant that the server would be along shortly , after all she was at the table right next to us . <sssss> we waited over 10 minutes just to be acknowledged . <sssss> we did n't even get a `` hi guys , i 'll be with you in one sec '' which i would have been fine with . <sssss> eventually the server came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink . <sssss> still no menus at this point . <sssss> luckily , we did n't want anything fancy , since we had no idea what they had in terms of drinks . <sssss> another few minutes passed and she brought us menus , and within 5 minutes came back sans drinks and asked if we were ready to order . <sssss> yeah , no . <sssss> she was more concerned about the 6 top of college kids than the 2 lesbians by the window . <sssss> we 'd been there almost half an hour before getting our drinks and our bread -lrb- which was good -rrb- . <sssss> i just was n't impressed . <sssss> our food , however , was excellent . <sssss> unfortunately , because i procrastinated in writing this review , i can no longer find what we ordered on their menu , so i ca n't even recommend it . <sssss> i think i had the penne pastore , which had incredible flavours , and my partner had something with farfale . <sssss> but since harley 's has since removed their date night menu from their website i ca n't tell you exactly what . <sssss> the portion sizes were perfect , and $ 25 per couple for an appetiser , 2 small entrees and dessert , the price was definitely right . <sssss> i do remember getting the calimari as an appetiser , and it was ok , but i 've definitely had better . <sssss> the pieces were thin , and it was kind of greasy . <sssss> there tended to be more breading than squid , which i hate . <sssss> if you 're a fan of good calamari , i 'd say try the bruschetta . <sssss> dessert was amazing , though ! <sssss> we got the chocolate lava cake and shared between the two of us it was just enough sweet and a great way to end the meal . <sssss> looking at the other reviews , i do n't think my service issues were a fluke . <sssss> it seems to be a recurring theme here . <sssss> you 'd think they 'd get the hint and start trying to fix it . <sssss> the food was good at least , but there 's nothing that can put a damper on a date night faster than awful service . <sssss> bring the service up to par with the food , and this could easily be a 4-5 star restaurant , between the food and the ambiance . <sssss> but seriously ... if i was rating on service alone it 'd be a 1 star ... if that .
?		this has been a staple for me since moving to arizona in 2001 . <sssss> i 've gone every year , and have only gone twice in street clothes . <sssss> every other time i 've gone , i 've been in `` garb '' -lrb- clothes that fit the time/period/event -rrb- . <sssss> i 'd recommend going in garb , either renting it at the entrance -lrb- starts around $ 35 for adults , $ 10 for kids -rrb- , or putting it together beforehand . <sssss> you can really get into the event that way , and feel less like a tourist . <sssss> plus , it 's just fun . <sssss> the tickets are usually around $ 20 for adults if you get them at frys , and $ 10 for kids under 12 , and to me , they 're worth every penny . <sssss> yes , food there costs money , as do any of the doodads and cool things for sale , but that should be a given . <sssss> all the entertainment is free . <sssss> one of the other reviewers mentioned that the entertainers ask for tips , and seemed to have an issue with this . <sssss> i do n't know why . <sssss> they entertain for a living . <sssss> there 's nothing wrong with asking for tips , and it 's not like there 's someone behind you with a great sword forcing you to tip . <sssss> it 's appreciated , but not expected . <sssss> and honestly , most of the acts are worth the tip . <sssss> expect to spend a decent amount on food , but it is less than state fair food . <sssss> and better , in my opinion . <sssss> steak on a stake , turkey legs , even soups , fish and chips and chinese food ! <sssss> there is soooo much to see that even spending a full 8 hours , from open to close , is n't enough . <sssss> this year i took my partner and her youngest -lrb- who is 9 -rrb- and he loved it ! <sssss> he loved the people , the food , all the cool stuff to see . <sssss> he wants to go back next year in garb , and save up money for a huge dragon puppet -lrb- drabbit -rrb- . <sssss> some of the best acts : adam crack , birds of prey , tartang , hey nunney nunney , the joust to the death , tortuga twins . <sssss> there are some acts i still have n't seen after having gone for 10 years straight . <sssss> ded bob used to be good , but his act gets old after seeing the same thing over and over again . <sssss> but go get your fortune told , hair braided or a henna tattoo . <sssss> kids love trying to climb jacob 's ladder and the new world joust . <sssss> take the time to watch the street performers and the jugglers , say hi to twig the faerie and the green man . <sssss> all in all , it costs about as much as a day at the state fair , but i think it 's more interesting and definitely more educational . <sssss> our 9 year old spent almost an hour with the medieval board games ... not a ds , psp or other video game . <sssss> . <sssss> board games . <sssss> it 's a full day of fun for the entire family !
?		this place is more about the scene than the sushi . <sssss> i just do n't think that the sushi is anything to write home about .
?		i used to be a regular here , but have stopped going because of the atrocious service i received on my last visit . <sssss> i will admit they do have some decent food and , depending on who you get as a server , the service can be decent too . <sssss> however , my last experience was just over the top . <sssss> my companion and i started off by ordering two coffees . <sssss> after waiting for about 15 minutes , the waiter finally came back with two cups of coffee , one of which was only half full . <sssss> we both stared with puzzlement at the coffee and when he came back a short while later , i pointed out the curiosity before us . <sssss> he looked down at the two cups , laughed , and then proceeded to pick up the full cup and pour part of its contents into the one that was only half full . <sssss> in the process , he spilled part of the coffee all over the table and then left us staring in bewilderment at the two , now semi full cups , and the puddle of coffee before us . <sssss> after another tedious waiting period , he finally came back for our order and when we pointed out the puddle of coffee on the table , he again snickered and sloppily sopped it up with a rag . <sssss> the remainder of the breakfast was similarly sloppy in service .
?		this place was just ok for me . <sssss> the service is slow and they do n't make enough use of the outdoor patio dining space . <sssss> they only had 3 tables out there and the space could easily and comfortably accomodate at least another 3 tables . <sssss> i had the breakfast that comes with the hamburger and the meat had zero flavor . <sssss> clearly , the chef has not heard of seasonings .
?		i must say that i am very impressed by the ownership . <sssss> within 12hrs i received a response to my review from tom . <sssss> this tells me that the owners are serious about getting things right and genuinely interested in their customer 's feedback .
?		jalapeno cornbread ... yummmmmy . <sssss> known for rotiserrie chicken and it is quite good and so is the rest of the menu . <sssss> i could get full on the cornbread and be fat and happy and ready to go . <sssss> there usually tends to be a wait on the weekends and last time we learned that no hats were allowed in the dining room . <sssss> a little stiff for a rotiserrie restaurant but it is still delish .
?		boar 's head meat and thick toasted bread make these sandwiches some of my favorite . <sssss> the soups are okay , but put them in a fresh bread bowl and who cares ? <sssss> the southwestern club is my fave with the tasty raspberry mustard . <sssss> the sandwiches are huge but they are so good you may not be able to stop after half of one . <sssss> the shop itself takes the minimalist approach so do n't expect any fancy decor .
?		i will be the first to admit , we went here for lunch and this restaurant is probably more of a dinner stop . <sssss> so , keep that in mind with this review . <sssss> first and foremost , the food was excellent . <sssss> my spinach ravioli with garlic creme sauce was delightful . <sssss> it was very light on the cream and topped with sauteed spinach . <sssss> highly recommended . <sssss> my husband 's pasta dish was light and tasty but the butter sauce lacked a little flavor . <sssss> however , the smoked chicken and bowtie pasta were cooked to perfection . <sssss> the sourdough bread and flavored butter were also a nice touch . <sssss> the atmosphere is cool and the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food . <sssss> we have spent this much at crappy burger joints . <sssss> the bar is good looking and we enjoyed the openness of the restaurant . <sssss> service was decent but it was almost as though we were in at an off time because our table was being covered by three or four different waiters/managers . <sssss> that did not really work for me . <sssss> i can imagine that dinner at bloom is spectacular and i look forward to giving that a whirl .
?		in the heart of old town scottsdale , los olivos delivers mexican food with an old style flair . <sssss> the decor is festive and the some of the waitstaff appear to have been working there forever . <sssss> first of all , they serve two distinct salsas . <sssss> i am not a fan of the enchilada type hot sauce , which is an arizona thing , but the other salsa is fresh and full of onions , tomato and cilantro . <sssss> it tastes as though it is made right before it is brought to the table ... so fresh . <sssss> we had to ask for a bowl for the salsa , which is apparently not normal at los olivos , but we were making a mess trying to use our little plates for the chips and salsa . <sssss> i ordered a combo plate and my husband ordered the enchiladas . <sssss> the flavor was delicious and much like tex-mex , which is my favorite . <sssss> the margaritas were also great . <sssss> the prices are reasonable and truly , this is the best mexican food i have found in arizona . <sssss> they offer fajita meat dishes , which is a rarity . <sssss> los olivos was packed at 6:30 pm when we grabbed dinner and we quickly learned why . <sssss> it has been around for decades and has earned a reputation for great mexican food .
?		this place has amazing deals ! <sssss> they have happy hour daily from 3-5 pm and again from 8-10pm ! <sssss> the lunch specials here are from 11-2pm . <sssss> i love the # 5 sushi roll bento . <sssss> it comes with soup , salad , spring roll , crab rangoon , california roll -lrb- the water of sushi -rrb- and you get to choose any two rolls from their roll , hand roll , and vegetarian roll sushi menu - all for $ 10 ! <sssss> that 's a lot of frickin ' food ! <sssss> side note : all their bento 's are ten bucks . <sssss> service , again , was great . <sssss> i noticed they got some new tables and chairs -lrb- although i did see a few of the old pick up stix ones -rrb- and there are two large tv 's to entertain you if your company is boring ; -rrb-
?		wowzas , i 'm impressed ! <sssss> like many other reviewers , i am not a fan of buffets , but when my family decided to meet up here for my uncle 's farewell departure , i sucked it up and tried out jasmine tokyo . <sssss> first of all , i love the fact that they kept the layout , with the tables , booths , and bar area the same . <sssss> second of all , they have sushi that is constantly being visabily made and set out ! <sssss> win ! <sssss> some of the rolls include : rainbow roll , caterpillar roll , fried jalapeño roll , a boring california roll , two other deep fried delicious looking rolls , and a few other maki rolls . <sssss> they also have sashimi -lrb- tuna , shrimp , yellowtail , squid -rrb- ! <sssss> aside from sushi , they have a mongolian stir fry station , prime rib , crab legs , salads , and tons of deserts , including gelato ! <sssss> i would definetly come back !
?		yes , i 've been drinking coffee since i was 16 , yes , i 'm addicted to coffee , no , i am in no way a coffee snob that can recite all the coffee barista lingo , but oh my goodness , press = so delicious ! <sssss> i just got a latte , but received perfection topped with a rosetta leaf latte art . <sssss> no added , milk , sugar , or spices needed here folks ! <sssss> the staff was very friendly bringing me to the conclusion that i need to visit press whenever i 'm at scottsdale quarter . <sssss> i 'd give it 5 stars , but i 'd like to try more drinks : -rrb-
?		im pretty sure i read about kim kardashian 's engagement , wedding , and divorce all while i was waiting in the 100 yard line to try on clothes here . <sssss> seriously , what takes so long to try on clothes ?! <sssss> every h & m i 've been to has a ridiculously long line , what 's going on in there ? <sssss> yes , h & m has trendy clothes for cheap -lrb- but ya get what you pay for -rrb- . <sssss> if you 're looking for an item that you wo n't be able to wash more than twice before it unravels , then this is the place for you . <sssss> why 2 stars instead of 1 , well the answer is simple . <sssss> i do , on occasion , find some cute top or dress from here that i end up purchasing cause i ca n't believe the price . <sssss> but , i 'm quickly reminded as to why the price is cheap when i pull my top out of the dryer . <sssss> this store also has shoes , hats , sunglasses , and jewelry to help accessorize you outfits and these items do seem to last longer then kim k 's marriage : -rrb- also , expect to wait long for checkout as well . <sssss> those extra two employees , behind the register that are n't open , are probably doing something important .
?		i do n't know much more to say to add to the other 216 reviews , but this place is pretty epic . <sssss> my mom and i decided to try out a new joint for my birthday lunch and i found this place via my yelp iphone application -lrb- win ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> this place is located on central and oregon -lrb- small side street -rrb- that we missed on our first attempt , but thanks to the circle k reference sign , we found our way into the parking lot and found a spot without needing to use valet . <sssss> we ordered an iced tea while we looked at the menu and decided we were going to start with the cheddar foundue , i was going to have the mixed grain salad and my mom was going to have the crab cake blt . <sssss> our waitress brought back our iced tea , we places our ordered , and then sipped our iced that turned out to be super tastey and was garnished with an orange . <sssss> we were already off to a good start ! <sssss> the cheddar fondue came out next with the tea light candle heat keeping the , generous portioned , cheddar cheese nice a creamy to dip our sausage , apple slices , and delicious scrumptious pretzel bread . <sssss> anyone that comes here needs to order this app ! <sssss> the mixed grain salad and the crab cake blt were both equally as enjoyable . <sssss> the sandwich came with three small crabcakes ontop of a toasted hoagie roll . <sssss> we chose the roasted veggies , that were doused in oil , but that 's want made is so scrumptious ! <sssss> the mixed grain salad was also scrumptious ... but on the more healthier side ! <sssss> : -rrb- the restaurant is decorated in super cute retro style and there is a very large patio , with misters , to enjoy lunch/dinner/happy hour on . <sssss> from beginning to end , our food -lrb- and drink -rrb- experiences were amazing and we will both be back really , really , seriously , really , soon !!!
?		blue nile offers something for everyone . <sssss> they offer raw foods during mondays while the entire week they offer dishes for vegan , vegetarian , and carnivores . <sssss> the staff is very friendly , but some days the service can be a little slow which is quickly forgotten once you have your food in front of you . <sssss> their house ice tea is delicious with all its spices -lrb- reminds me of chai tea -rrb- . <sssss> as a omnivore , i always find myself ordering and devouring the strictly vegan combo . <sssss> the shuro watt -lrb- chickpeas -rrb- , kik alitcha -lrb- yellow split peas -rrb- , and inguday -lrb- mushrooms -rrb- are a must try . <sssss> i love ethiopian food and eating with my hands ... the restaurant is heaven !
?		if you wake up one morning and ponder about where to go to get thymus gland , kangaroo , and/or quail then let me tell you my friend , posh is your place ! <sssss> i made reservations to sit at the counter and i would highly suggest doing the same . <sssss> interacting with the chefs and watching them cook and prepare each course is really neat and way better than any iron chef reality show . <sssss> service was fantastic , everyone was nice and my water glass was always full . <sssss> we were given a starter consisting of a peanut sauce with ricotta cheese and a splash of coconut milk in a japanese soup spoon . <sssss> that was followed by pumpkin soup that was good , but nothing off the charts . <sssss> it reminded me of something i got from trader joe 's . <sssss> my date received raw ahi tuna with a pear gelatin that was delicious . <sssss> my next course was a full deep fried soft shell crab with mushrooms and noodles . <sssss> holy crab , batman ... i have no words to describe the flavor party that occurred in mouth ! <sssss> i really wanted to take the crab out and take pictures with it , but i reminded myself that i am in a classy restaurant and that probably would have been frowned upon , but those would have been bomb-ass photos ! <sssss> my date 's next plate was sweetbread -lrb- yummy -rrb- that was served with a mustard sauce -lrb- that was okay -rrb- and cabbage . <sssss> the next course was kangaroo with delicious sweet potato puree -lrb- no seriously , i wanted some more of that for my desert plate -rrb- . <sssss> the kangaroos itself was fine , i 'm not a big red meat eater and honestly could n't tell the difference . <sssss> my date said it taste `` gamier '' than beef -lrb- whatever that means -rrb- . <sssss> i specified that i did n't like raw meat so i 'm wondering if maybe that would have made a difference . <sssss> anyhoo , my date received quail stuffed duck -lrb- or maybe it was the other way around , hmm -rrb- that had a lot of spiciness to it . <sssss> in my opinion , too much spice as that was all my taste buds could focus on . <sssss> for dessert i received some sort of creme brulee gelatin type that was delicious while my date received chocolate mouse with a homemade chocolate graham cracker that was the best part of the plate . <sssss> our next treat was the plum/blueberry frozen lollipops that a previous yelper had warned us all about and i 'm not going to lie , i was a little hesitant to try it for fear my lip would be the next victim . <sssss> however , i 'm proud to report that they must have learned their lesson because my lips along with my date 's lips are a-ok . <sssss> along with the bill , the restaurant gave us 3 little cookies in a bag which helped soften the blow ... clever posh , clever ! <sssss> my date and i had a great experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for something new , but we are not sure if we would go back on a regular basis .
?		i enjoy pf chang 's and usually come here for lunch for their yummy vegetarian wraps . <sssss> yes , that is under their appetizer section , but i always get it for my meal and am always super satisfied after all my lettuce cups are gone . <sssss> they do offer lunch specials , that will run you eight to ten bucks , that come with rice and a cup of soup , but i have never tried them because i am boring and always get the tofu wraps -lrb- seriously yummy -rrb- . <sssss> the service has never been great , but those veggie lettuce wraps still keep me coming back . <sssss> i also have to mention that pf changs is the first place i witnessed the `` mini '' desserts , which now i see almost everywhere . <sssss> i am a huge fan of their s'mores mini ! <sssss> so much flavor in such a little glass , with a fun little spoon , to eat your little calorie filled -lrb- well in comparison to the full size -rrb- dessert . <sssss> nice job pf chang 's , now to train for your rock n roll half marathon i am running to help burn off the calories i consume at your restaurant year round ...
?		the crab soup is to die for !
?		i used to be a regular here at gallo blanco , although i have to say this place has gotten a little brazen ! <sssss> we took our sister in law for her birthday and arranged for a table of six , we also asked the hostess if the outside tables were first come first serve . <sssss> she stated to us it was first come first serve . <sssss> we purchased a margarita at the bar and asked for an extra shot of tequilla in which the bartender charged me $ 6.00 plus the $ 5.00 for the margarita then did a no sale and just collected the cash . <sssss> we then proceeded to sit outside and have our cocktail , the hostess immediately came outside and told us in a very rude manner '' you ca n't sit there '' i know you have reservations , but all these tables on the outside are reserved '' the hostess left , we were miffed , we asked another waitress if the tables were first come first serve and she said yes ! <sssss> we decided to take our dinner party to hillstone , where people treat you with dignity , i guess gallo blanco has such great crowd that they feel they do n't have to have any decorum ! <sssss> sad for you guys , it 's not worth it anymore !
?		no frills here . <sssss> they come take your order , it comes fast , it 's cheap , not much of an atmosphere . <sssss> try the snowpeas and chicken - it is a nicely crafted dish when they actually stir fry it , the other day they deep fried the chicken and it was awful !
?		darn good coffee !
?		this place is great ! <sssss> right when you walk in the door you get greeted by girls with smiling faces . <sssss> i did n't bother looking at the menu because you could tell that everything about this place was fantastic . <sssss> when they asked what i wanted for lunch , i simply said , `` surprise me ! '' <sssss> i paid my bill and sat down an waited . <sssss> a few moments later a lemonade with ginger ale showed up . <sssss> it was all freshly squeezed and fresh . <sssss> lots of flavor and very refreshing . <sssss> later , they brought out my french dip . <sssss> wow this looked good . <sssss> big thick hogie bun and a generous amount of beef . <sssss> dipping the sandwich was great and the food melted in your mouth . <sssss> this was great ! <sssss> i will definitely be back to this place again !
?		the food was good but not spectacular . <sssss> the atmosphere and service was great . <sssss> i love the bocce ball court is great . <sssss> fun to play while enjoying a cervesa . <sssss> i 'm very willing to give this place a 2nd chance .
?		you have to try this place . <sssss> first time was a great time . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back . <sssss> everything was very good and fresh .
?		when on a wed night and as the reviews said it was packed . <sssss> i liked the laid back vibe the place gave and neat menu on chalkboards , i tried the raspberry citer beer and it was excellent . <sssss> the only think holding my experience back was the lack of choices in food and flavor in what food we choose . <sssss> we ordered `` the mess '' because a review said it was great , i personally thought it was nothing to get hyped about . <sssss> it tasted like leftover fries and gravy from thanksgiving after a week ... so i tried the wings , thinking ill call it safe , the wings were dry and the sauce could have been better ... i definitely would go back but not for the food ... just drinks .
?		i have heard great things about this place and it was nice to finally get there . <sssss> the atmosphere was awesome . <sssss> i went for a friends birthday so it was nice being able to show up dressed up and still feel comfortable when others were in casual clothes . <sssss> the waitress was great handling a party of 10 . <sssss> she always made sure we had drinks and was doing okay on food . <sssss> i had the prickly pear and cucumber margs while splitting nachos with friends , fantastic . <sssss> the only disappointment was the taco i tried . <sssss> i heard the tacos were `` soooo gooooud '' , i was not impressed at all and would not get tacos again . <sssss> other than that , i will venture back there , specially for happy hour .
?		i must say that oregano 's is my second favorite restaurant , ever . <sssss> no matter which one i go to im always pleased . <sssss> i took my mom here for her birthday and service was great , staff was friendly . <sssss> my waiter was a tad bid weird but hey , no harm in that . <sssss> weird goes along way these days . <sssss> i got the anti-pasta salad -lrb- large -rrb- , and split it with my boyfriend , it was great . <sssss> will always be a fan of this place .
?		i went to this place when it first opened and i thought it was overrated . <sssss> but i recently went back to meet a business client and it has changed ! <sssss> the service was great , the food was excellent - now i know why it is always packed now ! <sssss> had the crispy chicken and spinach salad which was really good ! <sssss> really fresh and the dressing was an amazing mix of flavors . <sssss> we also had split an order of fries . <sssss> which were real good . <sssss> my client had the howie burger and she liked it too ! <sssss> she told me that they have a new chef and has done some great things . <sssss> just lunch was enough to talk about . <sssss> can not wait for dinner ! <sssss> free valet rocks !
?		first time venturing into this new spot after a movie . <sssss> it was about 10pm and were lookin for a snack and some drinks . <sssss> was not packed as a normal spot is for a saturday . <sssss> which was good . <sssss> we walked in and there was not sign or anyone to tell you to go to hell or to sit where ya want . <sssss> we just sat at the bar , no worries . <sssss> mrs wanted to try a something from their drink list and the bartender was nice to point out some good choices . <sssss> she had a tasty le fresca margarita . <sssss> i had my hopes up for a blue moon , but no dice . <sssss> for some reason , half the taps were down . <sssss> the 4peaks heffe was good . <sssss> we ordered the nachos and the pot stickers . <sssss> was ok food . <sssss> nothing special . <sssss> good presentation and was tasty . <sssss> the interior was cheescake factory meets yard house meets a chain bar . <sssss> it was ok . <sssss> low lights , made it comfortable . <sssss> but you could tell that they were running on limited staff . <sssss> there were unbussed tables around the place . <sssss> the music was alternative and was t a good level at the bar . <sssss> we were able to have a conversation with out yelling , but the as you walk the space , there are more loud spots throughout . <sssss> the bar in the middle of the space makes it a great people watching place . <sssss> good mix of people , not alot of asu students , but not alot of families . <sssss> the service was good because we were at the bar , but there was a few times that people from tables came to the bar to get someone to come over to their table . <sssss> bartenders had a certain bitchiness about them that is good for a night club , but will probably hurt them if a more professional crowd shows up . <sssss> will be back . <sssss> just hope it will still be there ! <sssss> reading the history of this place , it has tried 3 times to exist in the valley , but never makes it .
?		i say i will never return after waiting 1.5 hours to eat mediocre food , but i do it anyway , maybe it is me hoping that it will be better the next time i go . <sssss> it was as disappointing as the last 8 times have been there ! <sssss> had friends in town visiting and they wanted to meet and eat there . <sssss> we got there with a large group , and was told if we call an hour ahead of time , we would be ok . <sssss> wrong ! <sssss> it was a saturday night and of course it was busy . <sssss> so i understand that . <sssss> the wait is not bad because of the bar outside , but $ 3 for chips and salsa ? <sssss> $ 21 for a pitcher of ice and sangria -lrb- more ice -rrb- ? <sssss> luckily there are comfy seats to consume the overpriced drinks with a bunch of grouchy hungry people ! <sssss> finally a gentleman from our group went in and said we would squeeze into a corner booth if they let us . <sssss> that is what we did . <sssss> i did not mind the squeezing , actually it was kinda fun . <sssss> but after we ordered the drinks and then waiting for a waiter who was a smart ass - it was getting old . <sssss> the interior is cool , the booths are an old carved wood and with all the crap on the walls , you know there is some history . <sssss> the patio is comfy in the springtime , but feels like the owners took their old patio furniture to work . <sssss> there is plenty of places to sit , but it is someway awkward . <sssss> careful , you might turn an ankle on the patio with all the chairs . <sssss> ordered the blue corn chicken enchiladas with red chile . <sssss> i know this place is not a new mexican style place . <sssss> my family roots are in new mexico and i know what is hot and good new mexico cooking . <sssss> so i do not know why i expected that from my order . <sssss> the food came and is was not a heaping large portion of rice and beans and entree like you normally get . <sssss> i thought that was chincy . <sssss> i dug into the meal and found the tortilla to look like it was a dyed blue , not a real blue corn tortilla ! <sssss> my wife 's order came with rice and she barely got a spoonful portion . <sssss> wth ? <sssss> where was the meat ? <sssss> the rice use to be hot too , but someone must have raised hell that it made all the food so spicy that there was no flavor . <sssss> now it is a normal mexican food place boring rice . <sssss> although spicy , everyone was on the clean plate club , not because it was not good , but because we were starving ! <sssss> one person in the group ordered the tamale , and it looked really good ! <sssss> she said it was good . <sssss> dinner at 6:30 - it was not going to happen . <sssss> we finally left at 9:45 ! <sssss> everyone left kinda disappointed . <sssss> i left muttering the same words ... never again !
?		made an 8:15 reservation on yelp for a late vday dinner with the mrs. last friday . <sssss> wanted to check out cowboy cio , but then saw the reviews about cph and decided to give it a try . <sssss> got there at 8pm and was greeted with a smile . <sssss> our table was still at 8:15 , but the hostess said we could hang at the bar or the stinky patio . <sssss> had quick service for a glass of pinot and tanqueray and tonic -lrb- $ 20 without tip -rrb- . <sssss> ok pour . <sssss> short wait and we were whisked away to a table for 2 . <sssss> was greeted by clark who quickly got us more drinks and asked if we had any questions . <sssss> good guy , very helpful and honest about his choices . <sssss> we switched gears to a lagunitas ipa -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- and sangria -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- , which was served nicely . <sssss> read about the pork bellly pastrami app and the citizen chop salad , so we ordered both . <sssss> clark hooked it up so we could have each in courses per say . <sssss> pork belly was awesome ! <sssss> c'mon - rye spaetzle , brussels sprout sauerkraut = goodness . <sssss> citizen chopped - chayote , snow pea greens , grape tomato , heirloom popcorn , grilled halloumi cheese , cucumber-onion salad & parsley-garlic dressing ! <sssss> very unique tastes and refreshing . <sssss> would like to have that salad in the summer for sure ! <sssss> main courses - the mrs. had the short ribs -lrb- $ 28 -rrb- and i ordered the meatloaf ... yeah , i know ... i was hoping for something epic in meatloaf , but it was good . <sssss> nuthin special . <sssss> the short ribs on the other hand were epic ! <sssss> it is served with this dried cherry bbq sauce that you would not hesitate to lick the small bowl dry ! <sssss> the short rib had a dark right out the bbq pit look . <sssss> it was awesome ! <sssss> comes with roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg . <sssss> dessert - `` donuts & coffee '' -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- - bourbon glazed donut bread pudding , vanilla sauce , cafe au lait ice cream , brown sugar streusel ... + more awesome ! <sssss> if you go , get it ! <sssss> overall , a good experience . <sssss> i want to give it 3.5 stars . <sssss> service was prompt , food was good , but it was the surprises in the ingredients that made it fun . <sssss> good mix of people too . <sssss> the price is a little high by a few bucks for items in my opinion . <sssss> i mean a $ 20 meatloaf should have been effin epic - right ?!
?		wonderful , welcoming service . <sssss> my friend and i cam here for a girls night and just loved it . <sssss> everything we ate was incredibly fresh and delicious - excellent pad thai and curry !! <sssss> they make everything fresh to order , which translated to wonderful meals , but not a long wait . <sssss> the place itself is super cute and large , and our server was attentive but gave us plenty of space to chat when we had what we needed . <sssss> looking forward to our next visit !
?		lovely , rich food , adorable atmosphere , spotty service and prices that are about a third more than they should be . <sssss> if you 're trying to wow a date , or just have drinks , this is a great place . <sssss> for dinner , for the money , you might be able to do better . <sssss> i 've been to two parties here , and it looks really impressive . <sssss> the atmosphere alone is worth the trip for a special date night . <sssss> i 've tasted/ordered many of the dishes . <sssss> they were all delicious and well made , rich but not too heavy and in perfect portions . <sssss> however , the dishes are quite pricey , and , in my opinion , not quite remarkable enough to merit it . <sssss> i think there are plenty of fine restaurants that charge a little less and wow a little more . <sssss> the service is , well , odd . <sssss> the hostesses and bar tenders seem nice . <sssss> however , i noticed that asking even simple questions sent the servers back to the kitchen to check - when i was a server , that was pretty rare , and they had almost the same menu many months apart , so constant changes were n't to blame . <sssss> the first time , the server was nice . <sssss> the second time , the lady was just bordering on rude , and bizzarely insistent that the salad i ordered contained no avocado -lrb- even though the menu expressly listed it -rrb- . <sssss> in a place that charges so much , i would have expected polite , knowledgable staff .
?		wonderful warm welcome and delicious bagels ! <sssss> my husband and i came in for the first time and i felt like we came over to a friend 's house . <sssss> the owner offered to let us taste the bagels , made me a special order sandwich , and told us all about how their bagels are home made from scratch , every day . <sssss> she even reminded us that we get half a dozen bagels to take home with our check-in - how generous ! <sssss> the bagels themselves are delicious , as were the fixins . <sssss> we ate them for serveral days afterwards : the pumpernickel is light and flavorful , the everything has tons of stuff on it , and the rest were great , too ! <sssss> we 'll definitely be back !
?		always yummy thai food - pad thai , curries , kung pao , spicy eggplant - all delicious . <sssss> the prices are reasonable , especially considering the generous portions . <sssss> the service can be a bit on the slow side if you come at a busy time -lrb- noon , 6:30 pm -rrb- , but they 're always nice . <sssss> i used to go to their frank lloyd wright & 101 location , and this one is much nicer inside .
?		i 've been through a lot of airports and this one has some of the cleanest and most modern facilities , friendliest employees , shortest lines and nicest restaurants . <sssss> clean , easy to navigate , lots of parking options , frequent shuttles from off site parking , and food from some of the city 's best restaurants . <sssss> since i travel so often , i 'm thrilled that this is my airport .
?		this place has been a favorite for a while - wonderful food and drinks for girls night happy hours and such . <sssss> my husband and i chose to throw our post-elopement dinner here and it was an incredibly positive experience !! <sssss> first of all , the back patio is beautiful ! <sssss> it 's got an extra bar , tons of room , fire pits . <sssss> . <sssss> our party was on a saturday night , so they had a wonderful acoustic guitarist playing softer versions of pop songs . <sssss> it added to an already lovely ambiance . <sssss> the food was delicious !! <sssss> everyone really seemed to enjoy it , and the choices varied wildly . <sssss> my husband 's and my sushi was melt-in-your mouth delicious , and they even gave us a complimentary slice of key lime pie in honor of our celebration ! <sssss> our large party of about 20 people did n't phase them a bit . <sssss> i talked to the manager beforehand and had the whole thing scheduled in minutes , plus he was gracious when i called multiple times with questions . <sssss> the servers were super nice and very attentive - no one ever had to wait for anything . <sssss> they split the check in weird ways with no issues . <sssss> all of the guests had a wonderful time , and so did we ! <sssss> we were only sorry they closed the patio at 10:30 . <sssss> i 'd definitely recommend this location for large parties , intimate dinners and everything in between .
?		looks like solid twos are the thing here . <sssss> was seated quickly , order taken quickly and first round of drinks all appeared . <sssss> going quite well . <sssss> the garlic fries came out shortly after and that 's when it started to go from 4 stars downwards . <sssss> cajun pasta : nothing original or subtle , i should known better . <sssss> monotonous taste with all the right shapes present but it 's a hit of their sauce and that 's all you get for the rest of the meal . <sssss> ny steak sandwich massive , but dry . <sssss> the sauce was minimal and the lack of drinks stopped erin from getting through more than a third of it . <sssss> also had those wonderful garlic fries but they either need to revisit the sauce and perhaps trim the gristle off come to think of it this was a lame $ 14 sandwich . <sssss> coffee : tepid , like it 's being heated by a lamp . <sssss> only had to suffer two of these . <sssss> service : started out great but the drinks stayed dry for most of the meal . <sssss> this was not on game night , rush hour so it looked like the usual mis match of staff to customers that seems to be phoenix area speciality in casual dining . <sssss> mediocre to the point that i ca n't even make fun of the place it 's just not worth it . <sssss> for non beer drinkers i ca n't see this being a place to seek out when their close , but tastier analog that actually has hard cider , yard house , is within a mile away .
?		after a couple of years going here i am upping it to a well deserved five . <sssss> i realized this after being on a low iodine diet for 2 weeks , eating nothing with salt , dairy , seafood or more than 6oz of meat a day , i waited and drove the extra 30 minutes from where i was to break my fast here . <sssss> i solved my hash brown issue by putting a cup of their green chili over it : perfected my burrito with 1 egg , chorizo , american cheese , peppers , avocado , and jalapenos -lrb- as i said mine ; -rrb- -rrb- and the amex thing , pah i 'm an idiot . <sssss> . <sssss> that 's been corrected , the review i mean i 'm still an idiot . <sssss> staff have been uniformly great , coffee barely goes dry , prices are totally reasonable because i usually do n't need lunch on the days i eat here .
?		i think i have found the secret power source that fuels the awesomeness that is captain bill 's . <sssss> firstly this place has more bumper stickers than a vw microbus convention , secondly the paint scheme could be a landing light for the white stripes but i digress let 's get back to the power . <sssss> on the sf2 game a sticker proclaims . <sssss> `` your honor student never gets laid '' to the left of the register . <sssss> `` my kid has sex with your honor student . '' <sssss> this sets up a reality inversion field which prevents much electronic equipment from working that 's why they do n't take credit cards -lrb- duh ! <sssss> -rrb- but also seems to power the time bubble back to a prior decade . <sssss> i 'm really impressed and annoyed that i had n't tried them out prior . <sssss> the two staff on today were described , e.g not lacking in the pulchritude department , from the other reviews but i did n't notice a lack of cs service , nor would i expect it based on looks so wanted to kick that one out the door . <sssss> we had a cup just collapse and a refill / mop appeared within seconds . <sssss> oh the food , yeah the food is not likely to be the best sandwich you have ever tasted but you may forget that while eating it . <sssss> smacks the chains silly -lrb- all i ask really -rrb- and offers well priced sodas , ice chips rather than cubes and fresh main ingredients . <sssss> as unpretentious as the bumper stickers that adorn the walls . <sssss> a statement of single intent . <sssss> feed me , fresh , cheap now : -rrb-
?		in context of eating prior to hockey . <sssss> we 've usually avoided this location on game night since the 30-45 min waits rarely fit in with our plans.this saturday , mar14th , we made a deliberate attempt to get in , waited 30 mins . <sssss> got in around 1800 , game starts 1900 . <sssss> the appetizer , entree and drinks were pretty good but we had 2 1/2 yard drinks which made it hard to have the plate right in front of us . <sssss> 1/2 a burger and 1/2 the fries are just swept up by the staff . <sssss> no attempt to verify our intentions just whoosh . <sssss> server aimee was apologetic and would have gotten us replacement fries -lrb- no burger seemingly -rrb- or the manager but we had a game to get to that would have been disrupted by either offer . <sssss> the $ 80 check for two people has to come with a degree of care and attention that were n't obvious . <sssss> so the food is certainly worth a 3.5 , but i ca n't recall the last time we had our plates taken with such `` reckless efficiency '' update : have received a $ 25 certificate for this process and will put it towards another outing -lrb- probably at another of their locations -rrb- . <sssss> update 2 : actually we reconsidered it and decided that this was a poor attempt to resolve a situation that should n't have occurred . <sssss> it 's off our list .
?		it 's not that the food is spectacular ; it 's only very good as a matter of fact . <sssss> houston 's gets five stars because they consistently produce very good food along with impeccable service and a cool dark ambiance featuring great 60s ' jazz in the background .
?		decor : dark and depressing . <sssss> the photos on their website are pre-remodel , so expect none of the fun colors and atmosphere . <sssss> service : really slow ... i do n't care if you spend an hour making my first appetizer , you have to get a drink in my hand right away , especially on a friday night . <sssss> it was only about 3/4 full in there so they have no excuse . <sssss> food : we ordered a bunch of small plates and they ranged from very tasty tuna ceviche to steak tacos that were so tough , you could barely bite through them . <sssss> the pork belly `` large plate '' was dry and way overpriced at $ 20 . <sssss> the portions are outrageously tiny there ; they make the mission 's portions seem like claim jumper . <sssss> my overall impression of this place is that the `` iron chef '' made a really interesting menu , but then has not been back in the restaurant to ensure things are being executed properly by the staff . <sssss> take distrito and strip away all the pretension , then add great service and amazing food , and you 're left with the mission ... so just go there !
?		they have a great selection of superb beer . <sssss> the service is always friendly and prompt . <sssss> they have really good food that will blow you away considering the college-area , micro brew setting .
?		i think the lady behind the counter did n't like me . <sssss> could 've just been me . <sssss> i do n't know . <sssss> it 's just how i felt . <sssss> when my boss first told me about this place , i thought he said `` al molina '' and i was like , `` you mean the guy who played doc ock in spider-man ii ? '' <sssss> i 've been here a few times , today was the first time i 'd been to el molino in about 8 months . <sssss> i happened to be in the area , popping in to buy a backpack at staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when i got back to my office . <sssss> one thing i really did n't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom . <sssss> that 's something very typical of , like , a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor . <sssss> i went to the bathroom and it said i had to ask for the key . <sssss> i went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so i kinda just did a little pee-pee dance until she came back . <sssss> it was a little too expensive for what it was . <sssss> a thing of chips was like $ 4.50 . <sssss> that 's crazy . <sssss> granted , the chips are really good and you get a lot of em , but ... do n't you have a thing of chips i can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion ? <sssss> i got all these chips in the fridge at work that wo n't be edible on monday , probably . <sssss> the burrito i got was very tasty . <sssss> the salsa they gave me was also super good . <sssss> nice and smokey and spicy . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> man , that shit was spicy . <sssss> i kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me . <sssss> i had to laugh when i opened up my to-go back once i got back to work because i actually thought maybe i did n't get any salsa , but when i took a look they gave me soooo much . <sssss> i made a small tower beside my meal , like a stonehenge of heat . <sssss> three stars : good . <sssss> not great . <sssss> weird bathroom . <sssss> unfriendly lady . <sssss> good food . <sssss> too expensive .
?		the salsa they hand you with the chips tastes like , i do n't know , agent orange ? <sssss> it does n't taste good . <sssss> my tostada was swimming in a pool of grease . <sssss> my enchilada was decent . <sssss> the taco i had gave off an aftertaste that was remarkably similar to a fart . <sssss> it had a crunchy shell that can cut up your gums . <sssss> goddamn , everyone who works here is so nice . <sssss> i feel bad giving it two stars but the food was really , honestly , not very good . <sssss> i am not a picky eater , really . <sssss> i am easy to please . <sssss> if i tell you a place has lousy food , then man , you are gon na shit your pants .
?		i ride my bike to work . <sssss> today i was running a little bit later than i usually do . <sssss> i had the slightest of hangovers , so getting out the door was a bit more delayed than is typical . <sssss> i was riding my bike down scottsdale rd. . <sssss> i 've peaked in the window of lo-lo 's before and i saw that it was under construction . <sssss> today , i saw people standing around inside . <sssss> it was open . <sssss> i decided , fuck it . <sssss> i 'm never late to work , so today i can be a few minutes behind schedule . <sssss> i still made it to work on time , but i set down a styrofoam box next to my computer with chicken and waffles . <sssss> the waffles have a taste of cinnamon to them and they 're super buttery and delicious . <sssss> the chicken is not the best chicken i 've ever had , but the best chicken i 've ever had was so good that if i told you how good it was , you would simply assume that i was exaggerating . <sssss> the chicken is damn good though . <sssss> the recipe that they use is very much complimented by using a splash of louisiana hot sauce . <sssss> it was phenomenally bomb . <sssss> i stared out the window , watching the clouds loom in the distance and raindrops spit down the glass ... all the while chewing on a chicken bone and feeling my hangover dissolve into genuine comfort .
?		i feel like top 's has been getting angrier and more bitter over time . <sssss> i called on fourth of july just to see if they were open and they guy on the other line told me , `` yeah and we 're a madhouse . <sssss> each minute i spend on the phone with you is another body out the door , '' and hung up on me . <sssss> i wanted to call back and tell him , `` you know , the amount of time that it took you to say that , you probably lost two bodies out there door . <sssss> you could have just said , ` yes we are ! ' <sssss> and that would have sufficed . <sssss> instead , you had to be snarky so i 'm calling you back specifically to waste your time . '' <sssss> instead , i 'm just going to yelp about it . <sssss> on multiple occasions coming back over the past few months , i feel like i 'm tip-toeing through the house when someone 's mad at me . <sssss> i do n't get it . <sssss> there 's a serious vibe of negativity going on . <sssss> specifically , the guy who acted like a fuckface over the phone has been snarky and bitchy a few times to me . <sssss> oh , and refrigerate your fucking beer . <sssss> i 'm tired of having to pop my shit in the freezer for 45 minutes cause the beer or champagne i buy is piss warm .
?		their hours overall are kind of sucky . <sssss> like , i do n't think they 're open on sunday . <sssss> i love pizza on sunday . <sssss> oh , how i do . <sssss> sunday is my lazy day -lrb- i do n't do shit ! <sssss> -rrb- , so having a nice piece of pizza pie while i dutifully color an aladdin coloring book or watch mst3k flat on my back is great . <sssss> they 're also not open very late . <sssss> if you only want otto 's on a friday night , you 're fucked . <sssss> however , they are very good . <sssss> i love their pizza . <sssss> i love it . <sssss> i ate there not too long ago and the pizza was not nearly as good as it was in the past , but it was a fluke , thank god . <sssss> it 's not pizza that 's going to be world famous , but there 's a certain and specific taste to the crust , the cheese , the toppings ... i do n't know what . <sssss> it 's taste made for me and i want to have a large pizza made for me , the size of a car , baked all around me , and i want to eat my way out of it . <sssss> also , i love their desserts .
?		tempe farmer 's market is rad . <sssss> their selection has grown immensely since today and when it had first opened . <sssss> it 's not a one-stop , get all your groceries for the week kind of place , but it works marvelously as a neighborhood market with a few necessities and a great variety of delicious fruits , vegetables , olives , pasta and frozen meat . <sssss> goddamn am i glad this place opened . <sssss> prior to this , my closest convenient neighborhood market was rollin 's market with its rotting bell peppers and frozen banquet dinners . <sssss> there 's always fry 's or safeway , but i like hitting up a small little market on the corner of my neighborhood and build a rapport with the employees and owners as part of establishing a community . <sssss> the dude who runs the place will sometimes thrown in a tomato or apple or lime in with your bag of groceries . <sssss> hey , free apple . <sssss> not everything they have is permanent . <sssss> sometimes something new will be there , and the next week it will be gone , but in a way , i like that about it . <sssss> you go in there , and they have these indian pickles made from wild cucumbers . <sssss> next week , in its place , will be garlic pickles or something else awesome . <sssss> for what the place is , it 's marvelous . <sssss> it 's a little place and about as un-ghetto as it gets . <sssss> it 's nice having a little market where you can pop in and buy polish sausage from a local farmer , organic soup , goat cheese with kalamata olives but you can also get your regular ass skippy peanut butter and campbell 's soup .
?		this all around one of my absolute favorite places to go whenever i have the energy to make it out there . <sssss> it 's not far from where i live , but you have to understand , i 'm incredibly lazy . <sssss> if i can get away with it , i 'll pick up the remote control with my foot so that i do n't have to sit up . <sssss> if you can , make it for lunch . <sssss> their lunch menu is , i would n't say `` cheaper , '' but ... you know , it 's pretty damn cheap . <sssss> ah , le mot juste ! <sssss> their hummus is damn good , i loved the shit out of their lamb 's tongue when i had it and they serve good , strong , kick-you-in-the-ass turkish coffee . <sssss> i asked the lady who works there what a great dessert was and she steered me toward this stuff that was like baklava but it had custard in it . <sssss> holy shit , it was incredible .
?		i saw a really great show here with my girlfriend and friend . <sssss> the venue itself , i think , has too many bizarre rules and they are pretty disorganized . <sssss> going to take a piss , i 'd just bought a beer and , hey , i kinda like pissing with a beer . <sssss> it 's fun ! <sssss> above the urinals they have these metal deals that are perfect for setting a drink on , in fact i ca n't think of a single other application in which they might come in handy . <sssss> as i walk in , this security dude goes , `` hey ! <sssss> you ca n't bring your beer in there , '' and i 'm like , `` well , i 'm gon na set it down right here , then ... '' when i came out , fuck , my beer was gone and so was the security dude . <sssss> thanks , asshole , this place does n't charge you up the ass for a drink or anything , anyway ... later on that night , the bar lost my friend 's atm card , and as she periodically checked the balance , she saw that at least one charge she was n't present for at $ 2 went through . <sssss> lovely . <sssss> the venue itself is fine , in terms of set up . <sssss> it could stand to be bigger , because this fucker gets packed to the gills , and apparently it gets ten times more packed than it was when i saw it .
?		3.5 stars . <sssss> after we went to the movies it was dinner time so we went across the street to la parilla suiza . <sssss> we were greeted and seated and then about 10 mins went by before our server came to take a drink order . <sssss> chips and salsa had been placed on the table but no water or drink orders taken . <sssss> our server did not seem all that enthusiastic . <sssss> she seemed as though she was just going through the motions . <sssss> i told her it was our fist time there so she pointed out some house specialties and then went to get out drinks . <sssss> i saw they had chilequiles on the menu and i love them and not many places serve them . <sssss> when i placed my order our server seemed a bit suprised i did n't order one of the higher priced specialties . <sssss> our food arrived and it was hot and the chilequiles were good . <sssss> we were never offered more chips and only checked on once during the meal . <sssss> the food was fine but the service was lacking , in my opinion . <sssss> if i was in the area again i would go back and give them another chance . <sssss> everyone is entitled to a bad day .
?		since i moved here 5 months ago , i am always looking for the local businesses . <sssss> i like to support local anytime i can . <sssss> and , in my opinion , it is almost always better than a chain . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , there are some chains i like , but if you buy local it goes back into the local economy more than if you went to a chain . <sssss> so i found mary coyle 's on yelp and thought it might be good place to take my daughter . <sssss> and we both love ice cream . <sssss> saturday evening , we had been at home all day and needed to get out a little bit . <sssss> 6 year olds start to go stir crazy after a while . <sssss> i did n't tell her where we were going . <sssss> we pulled into the parking lot and when she saw the sign she yelled `` ice cream ... yum !! '' <sssss> we walk in and are promply seated . <sssss> it 's busy with families on this labor day weekend and they all seem to be having a good time . <sssss> the menu is extensive but we like things simple . <sssss> my daughter had a child 's sundae , which i thought was resonabley priced at $ 1.75 . <sssss> she got a big scoop of mint chip with carmel sauce and whipped cream . <sssss> and ate every bite of it ! <sssss> i asked our server what she would recommend . <sssss> she suggested the vanilla carmel cinnamon swirl . <sssss> i had a scoop of that in a waffle cone bowl . <sssss> it was a large scoop and the ice cream was delicious !! <sssss> i asked if they did seasonal flavors ... my favorite is pumpking pie ice cream ... and , yes , in fact pumpking pie is one of the flavors that will be comeing next month !! <sssss> yay !! <sssss> i will be back ! <sssss> not many ice cream places ... real ice cream places , have a drive thru . <sssss> mc 's does ! <sssss> what a great idea if you just want to get a pint or a quart to go and be on your way . <sssss> for those of you who want to espose the evils of ice cream , go right ahead . <sssss> yes , it 's got fat in it . <sssss> yes , it 's a dairy product . <sssss> yes , you should not sit and eat a pint by yourself in one sitting . <sssss> but go ahead , live a little once in a while ! <sssss> it wo n't kill you . <sssss> and you must be a sad person if you never have just a little of this delicious goodness . <sssss> i know mc 's has been around a long time . <sssss> i know it moved locations . <sssss> if you take it for what it is , a phoenix institution , then you will be fine . <sssss> the night we were here , it was busy but the bus boys were cleaning up right after the tables were emptied and doing a decent job . <sssss> i did not venture into the restroom so i ca n't say anything there . <sssss> my daughter was enjoying the 50 's music that was playing while we ate . <sssss> i liked the overal vibe of the place . <sssss> yes , the staff looks very young but did n't you work somewhere when you were 16 ? <sssss> they just need someone to keep them in line . <sssss> the young lady that waited on us was very pleasant and came back to check on us twice . <sssss> i will be back for sure to try some of that pumpkin pie ice cream yum !!!!
?		my daughter and i had a mom/daughter day last week . <sssss> she had a dr. appointment and it would have been silly for me to drive all over trying to get back to work so i took the day off . <sssss> we went to the mall and she spent gift certificates for build-a-bear workshop that we had since we moved over a year ago ! <sssss> she was so excited . <sssss> by the time we were done , we were hungry and she said she wanted pizza . <sssss> well , it was wednesday and kids eat free at nypd pizza on wednesday . <sssss> so off we went . <sssss> i have been to the camelback location several times and it was always good . <sssss> we now live in chandler and this is the closest location . <sssss> we were greeted and shown to our table and my daughter got some crayons and a plate to draw on while we waited for our food . <sssss> everything here is fresh and i have no complaints . <sssss> the service is good and always with a smile . <sssss> i think the pizza is top notch and the pastas are great too . <sssss> the pasta portions are generous and i always have some to take home . <sssss> great for lunch the next day ! <sssss> i love the sayings on the back of the t-shirts too ... unique like a brooklyn accent is my favorite . <sssss> i think tony soprano would be proud .
?		this is still a 5 star store . <sssss> they have everything i need and then some . <sssss> but i searched and searched for the sweet republic ice cream and , sadly , i did not see any . <sssss> maybe they were all out ... i hope that was the case because i loved that i could go to whole foods and get my sweet republic without going all the way to their store . <sssss> i also noticed that they now have local beers from san tan brewery . <sssss> i even found a pamphlet that tells what they offer in the store that is locally grown or made . <sssss> i love it !
?		i received a gift card to amc for my birthday so i decided to take my daughter to see rango last weekend . <sssss> a $ 25 gift card bought our admission but did not cover a kids snack box , a medium popcorn and small drink . <sssss> i have to shell out an extra $ 6 . <sssss> and we went to a matinee ! <sssss> i spent $ 31 . <sssss> the theater is a little older but still comfortable with stadium seating , movable arm rests , and cup holders . <sssss> when i sat down i noticed something slippery under my feet . <sssss> it felt as though there was butter on the floor in front of my seat . <sssss> i did n't see anyone coming into the theater after the movie was over to clean up . <sssss> the bathroom was clean and there were plenty of stalls for when it 's busy . <sssss> but i just can not get over the price . <sssss> i have another amc gift card but maybe next time i 'll bring my large purse and bring snacks in with us .
?		for my birthday this year , my wonderful friends from san jose flew in and hung out with me !! <sssss> i could n't have enjoyed this dinner more !! <sssss> we all had a really lovely dinner . <sssss> the service was great , the food was delish and , in my opinion , the company was awesome !! <sssss> and we still got in on happy hour before we were seated . <sssss> when i was growing up my favorite food was my mom 's fried chicken . <sssss> so my birthday dinner was always fried chicken and mashed potatoes . <sssss> needless to say it 's been years since i 've had that meal on my birthday so i was pleasantly surprised when i found fried chicken on the menu at roaring fork . <sssss> of course i had to have it ! <sssss> and it did not dissappoint . <sssss> first off it was a huge chicken breast with a wonderful crunchy coating . <sssss> it was fork tender and served on a bed of loaded mashed potatoes and gravy . <sssss> yum !!! <sssss> i was a very happy birthday girl . <sssss> my friends have also written reviews . <sssss> julie k and vicky t both loved their experience as well . <sssss> i am glad since i chose where i wanted to go for my birthday . <sssss> i had read the reviews and the roaring fork was high on my list of places to try . <sssss> i 'm glad i chose it . <sssss> the atmosphere is a big steak house like but still intimate . <sssss> i totally enjoyed my birthday dinner at the fork !! <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back . <sssss> i know i 'll think that i 'm going to try something else but i 'm sure the lure of that fried chicken will be too much . <sssss> somebody stop me !!
?		this is located in the same area as red seven computers so when i came to pick up my laptop i has already made up my mind that i was going to have lunch here . <sssss> my friend vicky t. had tried this out and i know she has good taste , she 's my friend . <sssss> it was pretty busy when i came in and i grabbed a menu as i waited in line . <sssss> it 's the same premise as pei wei . <sssss> you order and they bring it to your table . <sssss> they guys in the kitchen were working fast and furious to get things out . <sssss> i was n't sure what i wanted so the young women asked me a few questions and made some suggestions . <sssss> i went with chicken broccoli and brown rice . <sssss> it came to my table about 5 minutes later , piping hot and fresh . <sssss> it was delish !!! <sssss> the broccoli was cooked perfectly , still a bit crisp , and the chicken was so tender . <sssss> the sauce used was also very good , a nice combination of a liitle sweet and a little sour with a small bit of heat . <sssss> ya , i know , but i 'm a wimp when it comes to heat . <sssss> i devoured it all ! <sssss> i watched as a steady stream of people came in , most got their food to go . <sssss> the price point is about on par with pei wei too . <sssss> i spent $ 10 for my lunch and a drink that was refillable . <sssss> this was quality food and fast ! <sssss> this is a great spot , a local business , and i loved it ! <sssss> support local and go try it !!
?		meh . <sssss> i had an amc gift card so we went here on afternoon . <sssss> it 's an older theater . <sssss> the inside was fine , seating is good with high backs and all . <sssss> the floor of the theater was sticky and that 's a pet peeve of mine . <sssss> the bathrooms are small for a theater with 24 screens . <sssss> and as i said in a previous review about another amc location , it 's overpriced . <sssss> the prices at the concession stand are pretty crazy . <sssss> i had a $ 25 gift card and spent $ 8 over that . <sssss> $ 33 for an afternoon at the movies for one adult and one child ? <sssss> that 's pretty expensive . <sssss> unless i get another giftcard , i probably wo n't return to amc theaters anytime soon .
?		i will preface this by saying i did not go for dim sum , i went for dinner . <sssss> saturday night and i did n't feel much like cooking so i checked yelp and found china king . <sssss> when i pulled in the parking lot there were almost no cars ... hmm ... at 6pm on a saturday evening ? <sssss> well , ok , it is , after all more known for it 's dim sum so we walked in and were warmly greeted and seated and drink orders taken . <sssss> there were two other tables occupied but after a few minutes some larger parties came in . <sssss> i went over the menu and found lunch specials and dinner specials , some appitizers and some pictures of dim sum . <sssss> nothing more . <sssss> where were the lists of noodles , rice , and chicken , beef , pork and seafood dishes ?? <sssss> did they give me the american version of the menu ? <sssss> no worries , i ordered the shrimp with snow peas that came with won ton soup , egg roll , crab rangoon , and rice . <sssss> my daughter had her fried shrimp appetizer that she loves and rice . <sssss> she got eight shrimp and said the rice was yummy too . <sssss> she was happy . <sssss> my dish was very good . <sssss> won ton soup was tasty , egg roll was not greasy , and the shrimp with snow peas had tons of shrimp and snow peas that were cooked perfectly . <sssss> service was great . <sssss> we were checked on to make sure drinks were filled and that we did n't need anything else once the food arrived . <sssss> and everyone was friendly and smiling . <sssss> i do n't know if this is a common practice but i noticed the other families that were there let their children run around the restaurant . <sssss> it was not crowded and they kept to the back so they were not bothering us but i do n't let my child do that . <sssss> she even asked me why they were not sitting at the table . <sssss> i 'm the first one to know how challenging it is to teach your child to sit at the table but you have to teach them , not let them run around . <sssss> i think it 's rude to the other diners but that 's just me . <sssss> one thing i noticed ... there was a large party in the corner that ordered off a different menu . <sssss> they were eating family style . <sssss> another couple came in shortly after we did and seemed to be regulars and they got a different menu . <sssss> did i just look like the white person that did n't know anything about chinese food ? <sssss> next time i will ask for the `` other '' menu ... the one with all the good stuff one it .
?		was a cool spot due to its support for ua athletic events and loved the location in scottsdale . <sssss> would probably check out again .
?		i 'm far from any kind of casino expert , but this one i do enjoy . <sssss> it truly has a little bit of everything for everyone . <sssss> the casino itself is pretty large with a nice variety of slots and blackjack tables . <sssss> a nice element is the bar right in the heart of the casino , makes getting a drink easier while you 're playing . <sssss> there are a couple bars along the exterior of the casino that usually has some good live music thurs-sat nights . <sssss> along with a couple pretty nice restaurants theres a dance club upstairs that i hardly ever frequent , not really worth the $ 10 cover im my opinion . <sssss> as far as arizona casinos go this is one of the best that i have been to . <sssss> with close proximity to my home , it offers a good time if you are n't expecting vegas . <sssss> = -rrb-
?		oh yeah , i 'm a fan . <sssss> the bistro is definitely off the beaten path , we almost could n't find it . <sssss> i 'm so glad we did . <sssss> the chili relleno was very much to my liking . <sssss> the sauce that covered my entree was spicy and so yummy . <sssss> it really was a beautiful dish . <sssss> the black beans and rice were full of flavor too . <sssss> i was so stuffed from the entree , that i got a slice of key lime to go . <sssss> i tasted my sister 's and was blown away . <sssss> the food was so good , i 'm not even going to remove a star for the flavorless lime mojito . <sssss> this place is a hidden gem .
?		i like this place , alot . <sssss> it 's classy , spacious , and the food is excellent . <sssss> i did n't know what to expect when i decided on the bento box for lunch . <sssss> everything was fresh and delicious . <sssss> salmon , grilled asparagus , mixed green salad , with spring onion soup . <sssss> it was filling , but i was stuffed . <sssss> ummmm , i want more . <sssss> i have been to the one in chicago , but that was a long time ago . <sssss> the next time i go , i think i 'll try the key lime pie . <sssss> our waitress was a little forgetful , but that did not take away from the experience one bit .
?		yes , it 's as good as everyone says . <sssss> both the shrimp and fish tacos were fresh and flavorful . <sssss> they put a nice spin on the guacamole too . <sssss> i 'm going back next week and can hardly wait .
?		i 've always looked forward to going to an original pancake house . <sssss> this was my first visit to an oph outside of illinois . <sssss> i ordered the spinach omelette with a side of bacon and of course pancakes . <sssss> the omelette was supposed to have cheese in it , and if it did the amount was so small that i could n't taste it . <sssss> it was n't very flavorful , but the bacon and pancakes were on point . <sssss> beware that they have a tiny little parking lot that fills up quickly . <sssss> service was quick and they refilled coffee regularly . <sssss> my sister ordered the coconut waffles ... one word ... yum !
?		i 'm pissed that i shared my desserts with my husband . <sssss> he did n't appreciate the freshness or the quality of the ingredients . <sssss> this place is awesome ! <sssss> next time i go , which will be next week , i 'm will not share . <sssss> the lemon cupcake melted in my mouth and the cookie , what 's in there ... crack !?
?		amazing breakfast burritos ! <sssss> heat up so well the next day , go here at least once a week !
?		great place for breakfast ! <sssss> awesome combinations , friendly fast service ! <sssss> omelet was super good and so were the pancakes . <sssss> we will be back for sure !
?		great salads/pizza and fun place for families !!
?		this restaurant is great ! <sssss> . <sssss> mike , the celebrity look alike - lol , was amazing as our server . <sssss> i had chicken pepper pizza and my fella had the lobster ravioli . <sssss> we`also had caprese salad and tiramusu . <sssss> all of the food was delicious and the service was tremendous.to let you in on a little secret , i loved the pepper dipping sauce they served with the bread . <sssss> i had heard about this place and when a groupon came along i jumped all over it . <sssss> i was not disappointed at all
?		dahl 's charlie has nothing on me . <sssss> we walked into a room where four scoops of gelato was only the beginning of this diabetic coma affair . <sssss> we then walked into the back kitchen and there were 5 tables full of any sweet treats you can imagine . <sssss> scones , muffins , cupcakes , cakes , brownies , and cookies . <sssss> also , a table of wine spritzers and water to wash down the indulgence . <sssss> they even had their signature , and oh so yummy , english muffins . <sssss> it was fun watching them bake them too . <sssss> i honestly have to say for the first time ever in my life that i am full . <sssss> lol -- i am actually so stuffed right now and full of sugar i am just staring at the walls in a daze . <sssss> teehee . <sssss> the thought of ever eating another sweet treat again is making me sick . <sssss> okay , ask me again in three hours and i am sure i will deny ever saying that . <sssss> by the way , the swag bag is to die for . <sssss> inside were two ten dollar credits to come back for more sweet treats and even more sweet treats in the bag . <sssss> sigh , again boo to the summer goal of getting skinny . <sssss> i have no will power at all . <sssss> thanks as usual to lindsey who is the queen ! <sssss> oh yeah , wow ! <sssss> did i mention there was even a wedding proposal at tonight 's event ? <sssss> so sad i was in the front room and i missed it . <sssss> i heard the cheering though . <sssss> how sweet -lrb- no pun intended -rrb- of the future groom who knows his gal likes to bake . <sssss> i wonder if he put the ring inside one of those huge cookies or cupcakes ? <sssss> :0 -rrb-
?		what a fantastic dining experience from the very first impression to the last . <sssss> the entire experience was just terrific . <sssss> i had called earlier in the day to get directions and parking information . <sssss> the woman on the phone was just so wonderful and friendly . <sssss> i was happy that my first impression was starting out just great . <sssss> from the moment we walked in we were made to feel like family . <sssss> as an italian restaurant should and is usually so good at . <sssss> -lrb- hint , hint to other vendors in town -rrb- the pizza here is totally , radically delish and i am very picky about pizza . <sssss> pomo 's is one of only two places in town to be certified in the making of authentic italian style napoletana pizza . <sssss> even with the burnt crust , which i am never a fan of , the pizza was still wonderful . <sssss> we also ordered the flatbread app -lrb- loaded with garlic and the size of a pizza , so heads up -rrb- and the caprese salad -lrb- delish -rrb- . <sssss> for dessert we ordered the tiramisu , and the creme puffs with mousse . <sssss> the creme puffs were light and airy and yummy . <sssss> the tiramisu was one of the best two i have ever had . <sssss> i have eaten a lot in my life since it is my favorite dessert . <sssss> now the impressive part to make me homesick . <sssss> as we were sitting and digesting our carb load and contemplating a roll out to my car one of the owners came to our table to say hi . <sssss> besides being an extremely handsome italian , friendly , and chatty he had a bottle of limoncello in his hands . <sssss> my version of the perfect man . <sssss> hello , but i digress . <sssss> he served us complimentary shots of their version of limoncello . <sssss> it has an icee creamy texture to it . <sssss> it took me a minute and a few tries but in the end i decided i liked it very much despite the unusual texture for this drink . <sssss> it was very inventive and i love food inventions/experimentation . <sssss> i believe he said he adds heavy cream and some other ingredient to it to make it thicker . <sssss> he also gave us a sample of deep friend dough strips with powered sugar . <sssss> it was kind of like a zeppole but flatter and harder . <sssss> the owner walked the floor chatting with his guests making them feel at home . <sssss> now that is the type of italian restaurant i remember from the old neighborhood .
?		the food is delicious , the service was grand and very attentive , and the decor is delightful . <sssss> it really is a pretty restaurant . <sssss> they have the best churros with carmel dipping sauce . <sssss> i ate a lot of them in spain and it is hard to find good ones here . <sssss> a suggestion would be to offer a deep dipping chocolate option too . <sssss> i read the two bad reviews and have no idea what that is all about . <sssss> they were all over us with great service and the only other restaurant with as good street tacos and such is gallo blanco . <sssss> i did not try the chips or guacamole . <sssss> i might have to go back if it is as good as others say .
?		i am reviewing sunday brunch at wrights . <sssss> lovely and outstanding ! <sssss> james our server was a dear , the food was delish ! <sssss> i wish i had more room for all those wonderful desserts , very unique menu , veal stroganoff . <sssss> vanilla bean soaked infused fruit salad with pineapple . <sssss> banana cream and caramel brule . <sssss> the cold buffet included all the standards like shrimp , italian ham , caprese , muffins , scones , and breads . <sssss> loved the zucchini bread . <sssss> the hot menu upgrade included lobster eggs benedict , lavender infused waffles , flapjacks , organic tortilla chicken . <sssss> it was delightful ! <sssss> the resort is so beautiful . <sssss> looks like a type of old school , european castle . <sssss> the lobby is gorgeous ! <sssss> parking is not that great here though . <sssss> this was a lovely day treat !
?		i was a little nervous reading the reviews about kids in bars which is not okay and not like one yelper wrote , `` innovative '' by the owners . <sssss> hire a babysitter if you want to go out to a bar . <sssss> a non supervised play area in a bar is frightening concept to this teacher . <sssss> however , it was my bff 's birthday and this is where we were going so i bit the bullet . <sssss> i was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> there were no kids there on a saturday at 8pm . <sssss> i was thrilled about how much fun we all had . <sssss> one of the owners/investors hung out and joked around with us for a little while , and the service was great ! <sssss> the place is more like a `` u '' shaped restaurant then a bar , and looked to have a pretty patio although i never made it out there . <sssss> we loved the band that was playing . <sssss> -lrb- `` the real thing . '' <sssss> boy , those gals can sing . <sssss> check em out -rrb- we even made our own dance floor and danced the night away , the food was yet another surprise . <sssss> it was good for bar food . <sssss> the pretzel was amazing ! <sssss> soft and fluffy with some type of cheesy/hummus/artichoke / whatever sauce that 8 gals had a different opinion on what was in it but all agreed was super delish ! <sssss> we also had the tater tots , -lrb- crunchy and flavorful -rrb- teriyaki wings , -lrb- yum -rrb- and a hummus duo dish . <sssss> -lrb- it was `` okay '' for ms. picky on the hummus here -rrb- the drinks were drinks , i mean how do you review alcohol ? <sssss> lol just kidding , i had a `` dragons bite '' which is like a fruit type tasting drink . <sssss> i tasted the `` cesar tangerine '' too . <sssss> they also have a few ice tea options for the dds and teetotalers . <sssss> there were a few negatives deducting a star . <sssss> the valet closed at 9pm . <sssss> we did not get that at all . <sssss> the bar died down at around 10:30 pm which is way too early even for az standards forcing us to head next door to jt 's for two hours . <sssss> this is another factor that cements it in my mind they are more like a restaurant , not a bar . <sssss> they forgot my yelp check in credit on the final bill , they advertised a special on their website that they did not honor -lrb- a business should always honor these things -rrb- and the back bathroom by the kiddieland had an issue with the door closing . <sssss> this might make for an awkward scene for sure if a child or other drunk patron walked in on you . <sssss> -lrb- `` onsie '' stall and the main door leading to the eating area does not close right . <sssss> arcadiatavern , you need to fix that -rrb- so , if you want a restaurant atmosphere with sports on the tv 's , yummy food , and music , this place is great . <sssss> if you want a bar atmosphere , maybe not so much . <sssss> i myself really liked it for what it was . <sssss> thank you at for the fun . <sssss> you just need to lose the kids area please , okay ?
?		i used to go here years ago when it was a casual cheese steak sandwich shop . <sssss> they sold the business 6 years ago and redecorated the place to a small intimate italian restaurant . <sssss> the food is great . <sssss> cheese-steaks here are still delish ! <sssss> service was good , and i loved the singer accordian player . <sssss> until next time - yummy dreams ! <sssss> ps - they have gelati here that is good . <sssss> we had the hazelnut chocolate one - sigh !
?		mary beth from the museum contacted me this morning after reading this review in an attempt to make my experience better . <sssss> i was most impressed by the call . <sssss> i will update my review after we take the trip . <sssss> i appreciated the reach out .
?		i finally went to lo-lo 's yesterday for a late lunch or early dinner . <sssss> after dreaming and hearing about it for years we visited the new scottsdale location and were not disappointed . <sssss> there was no wait . <sssss> we did go off hours though . <sssss> my guy tells me the place is always packed , so be forewarned . <sssss> we both got the betty boop and it was yummers . <sssss> they have fantastic waffles here . <sssss> moist , with a hint of cinnamon ! <sssss> awesome ! <sssss> the chicken was delish . <sssss> i loved the golden batter outside more than the chicken inside-teehee ! <sssss> the thing that really rocked it for me was the service ! <sssss> outstanding ! <sssss> i love carl . <sssss> carl rocks . <sssss> his twin brother micheal works there too . <sssss> in fact everyone treated us very welcoming , as house guests . <sssss> which kind of fits the down home , southern feel of the place . <sssss> i like it here very much and ca n't wait to go back , my diet can , but i ca n't - lol . <sssss> yes the food is not that good for you so it will have to be a once in a while splurge . <sssss> enjoy !
?		ok a short and sweet review . <sssss> a place to get stuffed for cheap . <sssss> this place has slices for $ 2.50 for a piece of pizza that is actually half a pie . <sssss> the pizza is n't the greatest but not the worse i ever have had . <sssss> small place , fun , cheap . <sssss> great service , enjoy . <sssss> good place if you are poor-lol !
?		how in the world have i missed this place ? <sssss> this place transplanted me right back to my ny roots . <sssss> i can just see this place in queens right up to the timely , wrought iron enclosed small patio area that opens up into a shady parking lot . <sssss> hahahaha ! <sssss> the previous reviews were right about the parking oddities , to say the least . <sssss> no parking lines and you are not sure where you should park since it is not a flat area . <sssss> i went to the restaurant earlier and i recommend you should too . <sssss> they say they open at 11am but i got served at 10:30 . <sssss> i got a half meatball sub , potato salad and a pickle . <sssss> it was one of the best meatball subs i have had in az . <sssss> . <sssss> i know granted that is not saying much but the sub was really good ! <sssss> however , what is really wonderful here is the bread . <sssss> delish ! <sssss> they make their own . <sssss> az is sorely lacking in the bread dept and it is one of the best sub rolls i have ever had . <sssss> i will have to go back and try something else .
?		i have no idea how i lived here so long and have never eaten at this location . <sssss> it seems sacrilegious . <sssss> i even worked at the pointe when it was located at south mountain for many years and still never went to this phoenix staple . <sssss> i was determined to go today since i had an event nearby . <sssss> if you like tex mex then you might not agree with my three stars and i say go ahead and give it 4 or 5 stars - probably one of the better ones in town . <sssss> wow , they even won a zagat . <sssss> i 'm impressed . <sssss> pros - * spicy -- yum * chile rellenos - huge meal for a la carte , but that could be a con - too much food . <sssss> they were tasting okay . <sssss> spicy yes but you could still taste the ingredients . <sssss> that can be a trick in itself to get it right . <sssss> * great salsa/hot sauce - i did not find this salsa very hot though , weird . <sssss> i liked the salsa a lot . <sssss> i worked at a lot of mexican restaurants in my day and i am picky in this regard . <sssss> * guacamole is not that bad for a tex mex restaurant . <sssss> not the best but good . <sssss> * wonderful funky decor . <sssss> it is like a mini mexican village . <sssss> very eclectic . <sssss> * carlos is amazing ! <sssss> * i liked that they serve water in actual beer glasses and left me an entire pitcher of water for myself . <sssss> it was very hot today and their food is pretty spicy . <sssss> * their bathrooms are cool . <sssss> cons - * the door was locked or hard to open when i got there . <sssss> good thing i called and did not leave . <sssss> since i was the only one there at the time i thought they were closed . <sssss> * the girl who sat me and first served me was not very friendly * far away in the middle of nowhere , at least for me . <sssss> * very spicy if you are a lightweight . <sssss> lol i am not but if you are , beware . <sssss> please , ask the server what you should order instead . <sssss> i overheard him tell others they do have mild choices . <sssss> * i found this restaurant to be very expensive browsing the menu . <sssss> i asked about the gift shop and carlos laughed at me . <sssss> he then told me it was closed 14 years ago . <sssss> i swear i read somewhere they had a gift shop . <sssss> oh well . <sssss> ha-ha to me . <sssss> the birthday gift has to be purchased elsewhere , `` friend who will remain nameless for now . ''
?		i went in today 10/18/10 to sell some cds for my landlord that a renter left behind . <sssss> i was treated very well . <sssss> -lrb- much better than the last time i was in -rrb- i also received an email in regards to my prior review from the store manager last week . <sssss> that is very impressive . <sssss> i still think they are expensive on some items but i understand they are a private owned , non chain store . <sssss> however , i am very happy to see the manager try to retain me as a customer.i was impressed when she tried to offer me a free coupon for a future visit , which was totally unnecessary but very classy ! <sssss> i love great customer service ! <sssss> it really makes a difference to me . <sssss> i was thrilled to see the dexter books on the `` hot item '' shelf . <sssss> i could n't believe it ! <sssss> they were both on my reading list and a long wait at the library . <sssss> so i bought them . <sssss> they were a bit pricey for used but in great shape so the deal was good .
?		despite having about as many restaurants per capita as is physically possible , old town offers up a pretty meager selection of wine bars -lrb- and good mexican food but that 's a topic for another time ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> luckily , 5th and wine has upped the ante since taking over from fine 's cellar and is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots : the good : - perfect for just drinks , appetizers , full meal , large group , date night , etc. - fantastic bruschetta and appetizers pair well with the vino - good wine selection and price points - fantastic hh specials with $ 5 glasses and $ 20 bottles - excellent service - live music on the weekends , nice patio the bad : - appetizers are definitely their forte , entrees have been hit and miss - i had a prime rib bbq sandwich that had more salt in it than the dead sea ... and i eat salt like it 's a part time job . <sssss> they were very nice about replacing it with something else though and at no charge . <sssss> overall a solid 4 and i 'll definitely be back .
?		there 's a reason oregano 's has an hour wait on a regular monday night : awesomeness . <sssss> luckily , it 's almost never as long of wait as they say , and you can always relax and enjoy a beer or cocktail while you wait . <sssss> our last visit was a party of 4 , and we only waited long enough to have a single round before being seated -lrb- which is not long ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> oreganos is just a fantastic overall value , and i 've always had great service and food . <sssss> they 've done whatever it takes to achieve the magic formula of restaurant success , and maintained this over a number of years . <sssss> parking can be a bit interesting for this location , and if you do n't want to wait i recommend arriving outside the 5 - 8pm dinner rush . <sssss> the only other advice i have is the cookie pizza is worth saving some room for !
?		eclectic or just `` off '' ? <sssss> i really ca n't knock anything about the food , but i ca n't rave about it either . <sssss> the decor is a combo of modern -lrb- think citizen 's public house -rrb- and one of the stores you find in old town hawking topaz and indian jewelry . <sssss> not my thing but oh well . <sssss> our server was average at best , and seemed pretty disinterested . <sssss> i would recommend some prompts at various stages in the meal vs. his approach of just standing there . <sssss> here are some examples -lrb- i base these on having dined out once or twice -rrb- : - may i get a drink order put in for you ? <sssss> - would you like to start with some appetizers ? <sssss> - would you like to see the desert list ? <sssss> - can i bring you the check instead of making you wait here 30 minutes in these tiny wooden chairs while your buttcheeks cramp up ? <sssss> the short rib i had was cooked well , but had little flavor and the jus just appeared to be basic beef broth . <sssss> little lady had the mushrooms -lrb- which were excellent -rrb- and the pops had the swordfish which he enjoyed . <sssss> i was amped about having anchor steam on tap ... but alas , it was warm ! <sssss> the brew from local san tan brewery was slightly cool . <sssss> such a disappointment with the suds . <sssss> there is obviously some skill with the chef , and 2 stars would be unfair , so based upon the whole shebang 3 stars it is . <sssss> ` nuff said !
?		while harkins is my favorite movie theater chains . <sssss> i like coming to this theater because they have the cine-capri . <sssss> cine-capri is one of the biggest movie screens in phoenix . <sssss> it is always fun waiting a new movie at harkins . <sssss> most of the time i come here with my family . <sssss> the popcorn here is great and i always being my harkins cup to get a refill for $ 1.50 . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		if you have not been to trader joes then you are missing out . <sssss> the reason why i say that is because everything at their store is awesome . <sssss> first the employees are amazing . <sssss> they are always asking you if you need help or just saying hi and welcome to trader joes . <sssss> second the store is not that big and you can be in & out of the store in 15 minutes . <sssss> last but not least the prices on everything in the store are excellent . <sssss> so , if you are looking for a grocery store . <sssss> you should totally go to trader joes . <sssss> my favorites that i get at trader joes is the sugar free chocolate , hummus and the instant coffee . <sssss> happy yelping .
?		i like coming to this amc on the weekends because the movies are only $ 5.50 before noon . <sssss> it is pretty cool that we are normally the only ones in there . <sssss> also the staff is always really nice and the theatres are really clean . <sssss> : -rrb- if you are ever in downtown and want to see a moving you should head over to amc . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		last night we went to angel 's trumpet with our friends andrew s. and erin m . <sssss> it is a cool new local restaurant and bar in downtown phoenix that opened a couple of months ago . <sssss> they have a huge variety of draft beers and a great selection of food that you can choose from . <sssss> we were going over the menus and andrew s. was telling us about the spam sliders . <sssss> that is right i just said `` spam sliders '' . <sssss> they were pretty amazing . <sssss> the spam was fried the perfect amount and it had feta and coleslaw on it . <sssss> i will definitely be back for those sliders .
?		it is fun coming to studio movie grill . <sssss> i like the concept of this movie theater where you can order food or drinks and watch a movie at the same time . <sssss> the downside is that the staff is always walking around when someone needs a refill or wants to order sometime else . <sssss> i will admit that the food is really good and they even have gluten free food too . <sssss> my favorite things are the skinny tea and potato skins . <sssss> normally at the movies the food is not all that great . <sssss> but it is nice to know that when you come to the studio grill you can have decent food . <sssss> if you are looking for a place to see a movie and wanting to have dinner , you should just go to studio grill .
?		this was my first time here and will probably be my last time here too . <sssss> i will admit that it was a cool place to go to and see the biggest organ in the world . <sssss> the restaurant is two stories ; they only take cash or checks for food and drinks . <sssss> when the organ plays the lights go out and you can not see your food that you are eating . <sssss> : -lrb- also luckily i had cash that night to pay for our food and drinks . <sssss> well it was a cool place to go to and see the organ playing . <sssss> if the lights stayed on all the time i would probably give it another try .
?		today i had the club sandwich for lunch and it was without a doubt one of the top five sandwiches of my lifetime . <sssss> a club sandwich seems easy enough to master but lucky strike threw an egg on top and change the game . <sssss> mind = blown . <sssss> also , i had been a little underwhelmed by the service in visits past but today everything went nice and smooth . <sssss> your stock is rising , lucky strike !
?		superb job by the copper blues staff during last night 's grand opening . <sssss> the crowd was asses to elbows but we never waited terribly long for snacks or drinks . <sssss> when you consider it was a hosted bar and the girls probably were n't making a ton of money in tips their effort becomes even more admirable . <sssss> if you like a beer selection that runs 60 + deep , eclectic music , a killer patio with downtown views , and wading in a sea of attractive people , odds are strong you 'll have a good experience at copper blues . <sssss> it really is a beautiful space with exposed ceilings , rich wood floors , gorgeous bars areas , and sumptuous attended bathrooms . <sssss> aaron may 's menu is still a bit of an unknown based on last night 's samplers but it 's hard to doubt the man responsible for so many restaurant successes -lrb- vitamin t , over easy , mabel 's on main , etc. -rrb- . <sssss> the big man was in attendance last night overseeing the finger food service , which included caprese on crackers -lrb- meh -rrb- , meatballs -lrb- strong -rrb- , tuna tartare -lrb- spicy and delicious -rrb- and sweet pea guacamole -lrb- five stars -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm looking forward to getting busy with one of his entrees soon . <sssss> copper blues is a big win for downtown .
?		i saw `` the glass menagerie '' at herberger theater last night -lrb- 3/27 -rrb- and not only was the play great but the herberger staff made the entire experience memorable . <sssss> as a first-timer i appreciated the attention and thoughtful each theater-goer received . <sssss> i 'll definitely be back for `` the second city does arizona , or close , but no saguaro . ''
?		i understand the comparisons to hooters -- cute gals serving up cold suds and wings to a mostly male crowd -- but the kilt has a much more sophisticated menu and incomparable draft beer list . <sssss> some of the downtown girls are a little green -- this location just opened july 5 -- but i 'm guessing that all-star week provided a nice trial by fire . <sssss> they 'll thrive during the diamondbacks ' pennant chase and upcoming suns game . <sssss> close proximity to the stadiums with excellent second-level cityscape views . <sssss> nice patio too once the summer heat breaks . <sssss> the only entree i 've ever eaten is chicken tender wrap . <sssss> it 's excellent . <sssss> the nachos are decent and enough to feed 6 . <sssss> would n't recommend the barbecue chicken quesadilla . <sssss> the tilted kilt has good food , not great , but really it 's the atmosphere you 're coming for .
?		viet kitchen opened a second location at 114 w. adams st. in downtown phoenix -lrb- tucked between downtown dining stallwarts the hero factory and z pizza -rrb- today and it was packed ! <sssss> while i kept it light with the spring rolls -- extremely fresh and they use the clear white paper i like so much -- folks sitting around me were enjoying the tofu with vegetables , vermicelli , and classic beef pho bowl . <sssss> despite being overwhelmed by first-day traffic , the servers and kitchen did a great job getting the food out hot and fast . <sssss> great job ! <sssss> owners jenny and tom nguyen are the nicest people you 'll ever meet so i do urge you to give them a try . <sssss> you wo n't regret it . <sssss> i 'm excited for the downtown location to be unlocked so i can start checking in once or twice a week .
?		make sure to check in on yelp to get a buy one/get one credit . <sssss> the biltmore store is a ton of fun with its goofy red floor and its looping cartoons . <sssss> and you may even run into a pro athlete -lrb- suns ' forward grant hill , who opened the door for my niece , who about died when i told her who he was -rrb- . <sssss> mojo is not cheap , but the service and atmosphere are superb and i 'd say the price point for the total experience is about right . <sssss> kids and adults appreciate the sample cups and the ingredient bar is always well stocked . <sssss> for lactose hating guts , mojo offers a dairy-free yogurt , which i 'd never put in my mouth but seems like a very nice gesture toward the afflicted .
?		best breakfast in town ! <sssss> but enough about the food , i 'm writing to regale you with tales of my encounters with the sexiest servers i 've ever seen . <sssss> i do n't what exactly it is , but whomever does the hiring at this joint deserves a firm handshake . <sssss> the servers all wear skin tight black workout pants -lrb- yeah you know the ones -rrb- that accentuate every beautiful curve of the buttocks . <sssss> the best view can be had while sitting at the bar -lrb- it 's wonderfully positioned right behind the expo line -lrb- where they put the food for you non-industry peeps -rrb- -rrb- . <sssss> these gorgeous women put the servers at hooters to shame . <sssss> honestly , the food could be total crap and i would still enjoy it with a smile on my face ...
?		great lunch buffet ... for some odd reason when i wake up hungover the only thing i want is plate after plate of indian food . <sssss> they have the usual assortment of curry dishes , vegetables , and bbq 'd meats , as well as sauces for the naan . <sssss> the best thing about this restaurant -lrb- bumping it to a 4 star instead of 3 -rrb- is that : they refill my drinks when they 're not even halfway down ; and they bring around fresh , hot bread once when you sit down and again halfway through the meal . <sssss> the price is normal for a lunch buffet , and everything else is what you would expect .
?		i am so happy this place just opened ! <sssss> chances are if you 're a fan of great sports bars you 've been to one of their other locations , but this new location on indian school is one to go out of the way for . <sssss> after entering , i first noticed that they did some great remodeling , knocking down all the walls and really opening the place up to show off the almost infinite amount of flat panel hi-def tv 's . <sssss> the hosts were comically over-inviting , and i 'm pretty sure i heard 5 or 6 enthusiastic `` hello ! '' <sssss> 's , but that 's the least of my worries when i enter an establishment . <sssss> after being led to the booth -lrb- yes they were packed , but there 's booths lining every wall -rrb- it must 've taken 30 minutes to read through all the specials , and i believe there 's only one hour throughout the entire day when there are no specials ! <sssss> we ended up ordering better than average chips and fresh guac and the best wings -lrb- golden -rrb- i 'd had in a while , and that 's when i saw it ... four massive flat panel hi-def tv 's set on transforming robotic arms that periodically shift them from one massive tv structure -lrb- showing one channel -rrb- to four separate tv 's -lrb- with four different channels -rrb- !! <sssss> i do n't know who thought of that , or if it was an original idea , but it was a really cool touch . <sssss> our servers were so nice and attentive , the food was fresh and generously portioned , and the overall experience was perfect . <sssss> it was great to get the same great things i had expected from zipps ...
?		one word best describes this place : overpriced . <sssss> i had the miso soup , the seafood yaki soba , mint lemonade , and shrimp tempura , and our table split a lotus on fire roll . <sssss> the lotus on fire roll was great . <sssss> spicy and tasty . <sssss> ca n't complain there . <sssss> the mint lemonade was also a nice tasty surprise . <sssss> there really was n't much else beyond that . <sssss> the yaki soba was bland , and the calamari was overcooked and rubbery . <sssss> the shrimp tempura was tasteless , and the sauce that came with it had no flavor . <sssss> and the miso soup was weak . <sssss> one of my colleagues ordered a plate of pickled veggies -lrb- i forgot what the dish was called -rrb- . <sssss> it was mostly a pile of boring dill pickles , and a small spattering of other , more interesting vegetables . <sssss> what a ripoff . <sssss> our bill ? <sssss> $ 25 apiece . <sssss> a little ridiculous considering the quality of food . <sssss> they seem to have a motif at tempe marketplace : it fits right in with its neighbors , lucille 's and maria maria , with its artsy-fartsy decor and disappointing , overpriced food .
?		there are a lot of pizza joints in the valley , and reading the reviews of each one , you 'd think they all serve the best pizza in town . <sssss> the parlor is no exception . <sssss> i did n't think the parlor would be the best in town , but it had one thing going for it : the menu . <sssss> i like their space . <sssss> it 's not as quaint as cibo or bianco , but it has a far nicer vibe than federal a few miles down the road . <sssss> they get points for having professional , yet relaxed , servers , and no loud music . <sssss> there is n't a scene here : just a variety of people out to have a nice meal . <sssss> it 's not a glorified hipster bar like federal . <sssss> right after being seated , i perused the menu , and found several promising pies . <sssss> the only thing i really liked about federal was their pizza ideas : the parlor is even better . <sssss> in addition to pies , the parlor has sandwiches , salads , and some tasty looking appetizers and antipasti . <sssss> i had the lemonade -lrb- allegedly from a farm in mesa -rrb- , the caponata bruschetta , and a 8 '' puttanesca pie . <sssss> the bruschetta sounded like an excellent idea : eggplant caponata , currants , roasted peppers , pine nuts , and ricotta on toast . <sssss> the flavor was a little more bold than i was expecting , but it was good . <sssss> i think i would 've cut back on the currants . <sssss> of course , the pizza is the centerpiece of the restaurant -lrb- it is a pizzeria , after all -rrb- . <sssss> i am sad to report that the parlor does not make the best pizza in town . <sssss> the crust is average at best . <sssss> it was n't bad enough to be a distraction , but it did n't have the best flavor or texture . <sssss> the ingredients -lrb- i 'm looking at you , cheese ! <sssss> -rrb- did n't seem to be the highest quality . <sssss> my pizza was much greasier than a pie with nothing but calamari , shrimp , capers , spicy tomato sauce , olives , and fennel should be . <sssss> the cheese is clearly the culprit . <sssss> that said , the toppings were delicious . <sssss> calamari on a pizza is something that needs to be done more . <sssss> it could 've used more capers and olives -lrb- were there even any olives ?? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the flavor profile was very good , even if the ingredients were subpar . <sssss> my friend went with the mare . <sssss> i tried a slice ; this was actually a very good pie . <sssss> possibly one of the best pies i 've had , as far as toppings go . <sssss> when it comes down to it , the parlor is a solid restaurant , with a very solid menu and a nice ambiance , that could benefit from a little more attention to detail . <sssss> it strikes me as the type of place where the chef 's heart is in the right place , but he is probably dealing with investor owners who do n't want to shell out for the best ingredients . <sssss> it 's hard to say , but at any rate , it 's a place i 'd go back to . <sssss> you could do worse at some of the valley 's more popular pizzerias .
?		i will admit , i have always been a detractor . <sssss> the moment someone labels something `` best -lrb- whatever -rrb- in -lrb- wherever -rrb- ! '' <sssss> my immediate reaction is to think there is a giant media conspiracy afoot to trick all the gullible peons into thinking they 're onto something really special . <sssss> so you can imagine my disappointment when , over a year ago , i finally got the chance to try this place , and found it to be ... good ? <sssss> ok , i still did n't think `` best in america !!! '' <sssss> was warranted , and i did n't think it was worth the 2-3 hour wait to eat dinner at a reasonably early hour , but the meal was clearly enjoyable . <sssss> fast forward a year . <sssss> we 're driving around town on a noble quest to locate the best pizza in phoenix , and we decided we ought to try bianco again , just as a yardstick . <sssss> now i have had some of the most highly rated pies this fair metropolis has to offer : i 've had different crusts , different toppings , different sauces , and i 'm starting to notice the little things that make the difference between a good pie and a mediocre one . <sssss> going into bianco with this perspective yielded a whole different outcome . <sssss> i can no longer deny it : pizzeria bianco makes an incredibly good pizza . <sssss> the little things were all there : the crust was perfect , the sauce was fresh and flavorful , the ingredients were high quality . <sssss> the toppings were simple , yet sublime . <sssss> this time i had the sonny boy , which has nothing more than tomato sauce , mozzarella , salami , and olives . <sssss> a very unassuming mix of toppings indeed , and one in which the flavors worked together in perfect harmony to placate my tastebuds in the most authoritative manner imaginable . <sssss> no , it was n't my favorite pie ever . <sssss> but it may have been the most well-constructed , and finessed . <sssss> in fact , i do n't even know if i can say pizzeria bianco is my favorite pizza place . <sssss> i have had a few pies i liked better than the one i had at bianco , but this one may have been the most technically sound , if that makes any sense . <sssss> so there you have it . <sssss> as much as it pains me to admit it , this place deserves its reputation . <sssss> one friend complained that they are too pretentious : i think they 've earned the right to be a little bit pretentious . <sssss> if you 're not too concerned about the details , you may not find this place to be that special . <sssss> but if you do n't at least enjoy your pie , there is probably something wrong with you . <sssss> i do n't know if bianco will always be this good , since they 're opening up other locations now , and when that happens , quality can suffer . <sssss> let 's hope for the best .
?		my favorite restaurant in gilbert . <sssss> this is my kind of bbq . <sssss> i 'm a huge fan of pulled pork , and their pulled pork is perfect . <sssss> i like the pulled pork so much that i have n't been able to try any of their other meat selections , which look great as well . <sssss> on the sides frontier , their beans are excellent , as are the garlic potatoes and macaroni -lrb- real macaroni and cheese , not the box garbage -rrb- . <sssss> the root beer is also a ca n't miss . <sssss> i 'm no root beer connoisseur , but let 's just say that i quit drinking soft drinks , yet always have the root beer at joe 's . <sssss> if you want something different , the root beer cake is also delicious . <sssss> the best part ? <sssss> the reasonable price . <sssss> a jumbo sandwich -lrb- 1/3 pound -rrb- , two sides , and a drink will cost you only $ 11 - $ 12 . <sssss> cut that to the regular sandwich and one side -lrb- a more reasonable lunch option -rrb- , and you 're under $ 10 .
?		the first time i walked in here , it was crowded . <sssss> not wanting to wait for a table , i decided to simply get a sonora burger to go . <sssss> it was decent ; the cheese-filled patty was unique and kept the meat nice and moist . <sssss> i recently had a chance to dine in and build my own burger . <sssss> now that the dust has settled , i realize that indulge burger is not that great . <sssss> there was nothing wrong with the toppings on my burger . <sssss> no , the problem was more the burger itself . <sssss> you see , this was my first meal after running a marathon earlier in the day , and i was ready to stuff my face with protein . <sssss> i had an appetite , and i was thirsty . <sssss> would have been nice to have a high quality non-alcoholic beverage that evening . <sssss> every respectable burger joint has something good to drink , whether it is the local sonoran root beer that delux and the grind serve , or the blackberry peach lemonade at zinburger , or even diablo burger 's bottled cokes . <sssss> indulge burger ? <sssss> pepsi products . <sssss> lame . <sssss> i ordered my burger medium rare , as usual . <sssss> and because i was so hungry , i went with the 2/3 pounder . <sssss> i figured after burning 4,000 calories in one day , i deserved it . <sssss> but what i got was 2/3 pound of well-done , dry beef that becomes even more difficult to break down when your saliva reserves have already been long exhausted . <sssss> it was like eating a sponge with nice toppings . <sssss> i ordered fries , but the burger had already sucked me dry , so those fries were about as easy to eat as cotton balls . <sssss> it certainly did n't help that they were just not very good , with no special seasonings or anything . <sssss> for a burger joint as popular as this , they really need to do something about their fries . <sssss> luckily , the bartender saw that i barely touched them , and took them off my bill without even being asked . <sssss> perhaps he realized how boring they are . <sssss> whatever the reason , this earned them an extra star . <sssss> when you compare this place to the other great burgers of the phoenix metro area , you 'll notice that the price is the same , but the food just does not measure up . <sssss> the sonora burger is worth trying once , but even that is a little bit of a gimmick . <sssss> i 'll take a properly cooked , succulent meat patty over a cheese-filled and peanut butter-topped novelty any day of the week .
?		now this is good caribbean food . <sssss> we wandered in a little after noon , and the place was empty ... four tables , and the nice lady who runs the place . <sssss> i could tell right away that this was going to be authentic . <sssss> i ordered the curry goat , and washed it down with a bottle of kola champagne . <sssss> it was just like old times , when i was offered curry goat by a jamaican woman i knew in new york : `` would you like some curry goat ? '' <sssss> `` i do n't particularly care for goat . '' <sssss> `` have you had curry goat ? '' <sssss> `` no . '' <sssss> `` you 're having some curry goat . '' <sssss> yes , curry goat is delicious . <sssss> this curry goat definitely met expectations , with a hearty flavor , and very tender . <sssss> it had the texture of a good pot roast . <sssss> and it had some potatoes mixed in , which taste great when soaked in curry goat juice . <sssss> the plate also came with some rice , some of the most delicious plantains i 've had , as well as a green salad i could have done without , but ultimately appreciated because i really should eat my vegetables . <sssss> no , they 're not the fastest place , but it 's really like eating home-cooked caribbean food . <sssss> and you do n't go eat at someone 's house and expect their service to be the most efficient , do you ? <sssss> the essence of this place was perfectly captured by my coworker , who after i mentioned it might be added to the rotation , said , `` f@#k the rotation , i 'm eating here every day ! ''
?		beaver choice is an excellent place which i have had the chance to visit three or four times . <sssss> this is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant . <sssss> it 's like eating at mom 's house , if mom happens to be swedish . <sssss> i 've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu , pork medallions , seared gravlax -- and all were delicious . <sssss> especially the gravlax . <sssss> the sides are also great , and you usually get three per meal . <sssss> the poutine is perhaps not as good as what you 'd get in quebec , but it 's easily the best i 've had in arizona . <sssss> the fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points . <sssss> i have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty , the beaver supreme . <sssss> this mess of chocolate , meringue , cream , mandarin orange , and possibly a few other things , is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting , but ultimately find your free will diminished , invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes . <sssss> also , it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap . <sssss> i just have to ask , why would anyone go to a scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap ? <sssss> can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a viking camp and order a chicken wrap ? <sssss> your head would be off before you could recite one measly odinian incantation .
?		i 've been here three or four times now , and i figured it 's about time i review this place . <sssss> first of all , the only reason i ever come here -lrb- after the first trip , of course -rrb- is because someone else is buying . <sssss> because i would never pay $ 8 for two giant slices of bread with a few meager slices of lunch meat in between . <sssss> they have some great sandwich ideas there , but it 's hard to realize any of those ideas when you ca n't even taste them between all that bread . <sssss> at least at dilly 's -lrb- at least the last time i went there -rrb- , they actually put some meat on your sandwich , even if it does n't hang over the edge . <sssss> oh , and dilly 's also gives you * both * a pickle and a choice of various sides , instead of a pickle * or * a crappy bag of chips . <sssss> truth be told , i 'm being generous with this two star rating . <sssss> bison witches really sucks , when you consider how much it pales in comparison to dilly 's , which itself is n't exactly a gourmet sandwich shop . <sssss> edit : allegedly they 'll give you the pickle for free if you ask for it . <sssss> not sure why that 's not just the default option , but whatever ...
?		happy hour was awesome at the yard house . <sssss> the ahi stack was great and $ 5 !! <sssss> wow !! <sssss> loads of beer ... choices . <sssss> . <sssss> good times !!! <sssss> great happy hour !
?		had n't been in north scottsdale in a while , recalling quickly all that i had been missing . <sssss> as i walked in a lovely was coming out in her high heels and all dressed up ready to go hit the town . <sssss> . <sssss> oh yeah . <sssss> . <sssss> the food the food . <sssss> this was an evfn event , they extended the happy hour for us for a couple of hours , and buy was that a good thing . <sssss> the sushi is incerdible , the miso soup , the salmon the tuna . <sssss> . <sssss> all fantastic . <sssss> i even tried the little burger for $ 2 ... amazign tastes all around . <sssss> leelani was our server , sweet and pretty gal who could tell you everything about the menu and what to get . <sssss> . <sssss> still see her smile . <sssss> hope to get back there again one day . <sssss> . <sssss> although they knew it was my bday ... an no real deal .
?		blue adobe catered the toys for tots poker tournament sponsored cstor and larry gentry . <sssss> the food was amazing , the pork loins tender , the size of the shrimp outstanding with many condiments to make it even better the chipolte sauce had a great tangy taste . <sssss> also the mini chimichangas were great . <sssss> the two gals there had smiling faces and kept the set up stocked . <sssss> ca n't wait to see this place for a meal in the restaurant .
?		i 'd keep going back just for the sweet potato chips and the patio dining . <sssss> it 's a perfect place for lunch . <sssss> two can share many of the menu items . <sssss> we loved the pear and gorgonzola flatbread . <sssss> the service and the orange blossom iced tea helped provide an upbeat atmosphere . <sssss> i 'm eager to try some of the other flat breads , as well as the smoked trout beignets , the white bean chili and some of the salads . <sssss> do n't pass this up if you are in downtown scottsdale .
?		tapas papa frita is a good place for tapas . <sssss> location and decor is great , you 'll like the patio , the ambience , the service . <sssss> we 've tried it twice , once by ourselves for lunch and once with a party of eight for dinner . <sssss> there was plenty of variety to the tapas menu , and most were ok -- worth an occasional visit -- but nothing really thrilled us . <sssss> same thing for the entrees . <sssss> most were ok but not memorable . <sssss> the paella was the dreadful exception . <sssss> i had the paella de pollo , and a friend had the paella valenciana . <sssss> they may as well have been rice soup . <sssss> very watery and none of the crispy scrapings that makes paella so good .
?		four of us went there for dinner on 11/29/10 . <sssss> it is newly opened and the atmosphere is elegant and spacious . <sssss> the menu runs closer to southwest/mexican rather than mexican/american . <sssss> among us we had the pork tamale , the chicken & mushroom quesadilla , the guacamole , the chicken enchilada , fish tacos , yucatan pork stew and sopapillas . <sssss> service started with the margaritas and a basket of yellow corn , black corn , yucca , and plantain chips with two salsas . <sssss> everything was excellent , but the real standouts were the guacamole and the margarita de taberna . <sssss> we 'll surely go back . <sssss> our only reservations were that the menu could have been larger , and the waiter over-reacted when two of the diners expressed an aversion to cilantro . <sssss> instead of bringing a cilantro-based sauce on the side , he skipped the sauce entirely on the tacos and tamale .
?		i really wanted to love tradiciones . <sssss> really . <sssss> but i did n't . <sssss> after weaving my way through the perplexing plaza that is in front of the patio in front of the restaurant -lrb- i saw a sign that said this not the entrance , but not one that said this is the entrance -rrb- , i finally found the entrance . <sssss> the smallish entranceway opens into a grand space that is incredibly lovely with tons of bent steel and bright colors . <sssss> i could n't believe that i was in the same building as the ranch market . <sssss> i was so mesmerized by the beauty of the location , and the display of a gajillion tequilas , and the music of the roving mariachis , that almost any food set before me would have been forgiven . <sssss> almost . <sssss> the chips and salsa were okay , but my entree was really disappointing . <sssss> i ordered the spinach enchiladas and got a bland enchilada with barely cooked button mushrooms and hardly a shred of spinach ! <sssss> seriously . <sssss> i expected to bust into my little rolls to find a plethora of greens , but actually had to dig and search for a mere shriggle . <sssss> and the beans and rice were mediocre at best . <sssss> but , i must confess , my partners pollo looked incredibly tasty and he said it was . <sssss> i 'll have to take his word for it , because i wo n't be going back to try again when i could just as easily go to la tolteca for much better food .
?		considering the lack of dive bars left in downtown phoenix , the bikini gets 5 stars , otherwise it would get 4 . <sssss> we started going there about 6 years ago when we lived in the fq story district . <sssss> we love dive bars , and the best time to go is during the week or on a sunday afternoon if you really want to get a feel for the typical clientele . <sssss> i love the wackiness of this place and believe it or not , they have cleaned up the place a bit . <sssss> this was the very first bar that anyone ever bought us a drink for no reason . <sssss> the owner was hanging out with her csi buddies and her boyfriend brought us over two beers . <sssss> in buffalo , regulars and bartenders often buy drinks for other clientele , but we had not yet experienced this in phoenix . <sssss> this man renewed our faith in bar etiquette . <sssss> more recently , we spent nye here and even though i was the designated driver , i had a great time . <sssss> we walked in and before my cohort could decide what they wanted to drink , we noticed that a gentleman had left his dentures in his hat on the bar while he was about 10 feet away playing video crack . <sssss> where else does this happen but the bikini ? <sssss> later , my husband was outside smoking and some guy with no shoes came up to him to ask `` are you down for whatever ? '' <sssss> again , where else would this happen ? <sssss> and , we managed to entertain ourselves throughout the night by sending boys into the restroom to purchase postage stamp sized porn from the porn and wierd condom machine . <sssss> hilarious . <sssss> then the bar owner started handing out fringed squakers , hats and noise makers at about 11 , which meant that for an hour people were making tons of noise . <sssss> i had a blast .
?		wow . <sssss> i 've been reading the other reviews and i 'm honestly shocked . <sssss> i 've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it . <sssss> i liked it better when it was small and unknown , but that 's because i could enjoy it at my leisure . <sssss> the owner would often come out and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new phenomenon . <sssss> the food has been consistently tasty and fairly priced . <sssss> the only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor . <sssss> i 've taken all sorts of people here to eat and no one has ever disagreed that it was the best chinese food . <sssss> i have always had at least adequate service on first fridays . <sssss> the rest of the time , the service is as wonderful as the food .
?		oh xtreme bean , our time is coming to an end . <sssss> we have spent many hours together fretting over exams and the basic science boards . <sssss> and , i just want to take this moment to let you know how much i appreciate you . <sssss> i love your employees . <sssss> consistently nice , sometimes funny , and always quick to fulfill my order . <sssss> their music selection is pretty awesome too . <sssss> sometimes classic rock , sometimes a blend of old and new indie , but always good enough that i rarely put on headphones unless it 's to cover up people talking . <sssss> i love your coffee , your ginormous selection of herbal teas , your jalapeno-cheddar cream cheese on a bagel , and so much more that i 've tried . <sssss> i love the smell of beans roasting in the corner . <sssss> i love the comfy desk chair that my heiny is planted in at this very moment . <sssss> i love the study cubicles in the vault . <sssss> i love the ability to sit here for hours when i have to and not feel as if i 'm a hinderance to your business . <sssss> you are a student 's dream . <sssss> and your drive-thru window is fabulous . <sssss> except ... ugh , i hesitate to even bring it up . <sssss> it 's not you , it 's me . <sssss> sometimes it 's so busy i ca n't get a seat . <sssss> and , sometimes your wifi does n't have enough oomph to satisfy . <sssss> but your goods far outweigh your bads and i 'm sure that you will make other students very happy in the future . <sssss> i will always treasure the time we have already shared and looked forward to these last few months that we have in our future . <sssss> love always , jen
?		awesome wings ! <sssss> they 're big and meaty , cooked to our specifications of crispy and with a really good spicy/vinegary sauce . <sssss> actually i do n't think i 've ever had a bad meal at seamus 's . <sssss> it 's not fancy , it 's just a bar with a sampling of american and irish food . <sssss> service is always good . <sssss> they have a variety of booze and beer from ireland , as well as crap beer for lame people who would dare step foot in an irish pub and order something that is n't a guiness/harp/smithwick 's . <sssss> and i 've had many good times at this place over the years .
?		went here to have lunch and they serve such a great selection of appetizers that we order off that menu and shared ! <sssss> good food , well prepared and pretty good service for a very busy sunday afternoon . <sssss> they have a good mix of food with a fresh sushi bar . <sssss> nice outside seating area too . <sssss> go out and try it !
?		this is a great place to eat `` except '' they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service . <sssss> on occasion when my wife and i stop on for lunch , there always manages to be some issue with the food in one another 's meal . <sssss> given there are 2 of us ? <sssss> that translates to them hitting the mark 50 % of the time . <sssss> the menu selection is awesome . <sssss> the dark molasses indian bread with butter is worth the trip and if you can get a great service , try the appetiser salad of pecan , endive and blue cheese . <sssss> the take out cheese cake cant be beat .
?		great great food , but go to the bank first and check you account balance cause the prices are ridiculous . <sssss> guacamole is very different but in a good way . <sssss> appetizers are amazing . <sssss> main dishes , although flavorful , are incredibly expensive . <sssss> their version of carne ' asada is serving them taco style . <sssss> it might be mexican cuisine , but i 'm not a fan . <sssss> their favored margarita known as the `` low rider '' will sneak up on you so be careful . <sssss> it will also sneak up on your wallet at 13 dollars a pop . <sssss> service in the restaurant for us was good but the food came out too slowly so be aware that you might have to wait a while . <sssss> it 's also very loud with hard floors and the place packs up pretty fast . <sssss> my advice is to go for a nice bottled beer and share a main course meal or go at happy hour and save some coin on some incredible good appetizers . <sssss> at lease you can enjoy the food and not break the bank ! <sssss> would i go back again ? <sssss> prolly ' not ... stew ~
?		this is a really great theater for a mall . <sssss> with each theater they all have their different attributes and pluses and minuses . <sssss> this is a clean theater and close to parking and other restaurants . <sssss> what i like the most is that there are other eats and activities and shopping that can be part of a full day of fun if you include a movie . <sssss> you can catch a great lunch or quick treat , see a movie , go have dinner , shop and return home .
?		6:30 pm monday night , empty empty empty . <sssss> but that did n't stop me from getting the most delicious crepes in town ! <sssss> the hosts/owner ? <sssss> was very friendly , had us sit anywhere we wanted . <sssss> our waitress was super hot and nice ! <sssss> later there was a couple more people that came in but i think that was it for the night since they close at 9 and it was about 8:30 pm when we left . <sssss> anyways . <sssss> . <sssss> so we ordered the traditional flammenkuchen for the appetizer ... mmmm crispy tart crust with bacon , onions and melted swiss cheese . <sssss> tasty ! <sssss> i ordered the nordique crepe - - crepe filled with smoked salmon , melted swiss cheese and drizzled with lemon dill sauce . <sssss> yummers ! <sssss> and it came with a side green salad . <sssss> = -rrb- although i have to say it was a bit on the salty side ... it was great but i think the smoked salmon was a bit salty . <sssss> my bf ordered the savoyarde crepe - - filled with bacon , onions , sliced sauteed potatoes and melted raclette cheese . <sssss> yummers ! <sssss> this one is not as salty even though it 's loaded with bacon . <sssss> we also had a side order of sweet potatoes fries , crispy and perfectly seasoned . <sssss> = -rrb- unfortunately i was so stuff with the heavenly goodness of the savory crepes that i really did n't have room for dessert so my bf promised we would go back for the sweet crepes ^_^ . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back !
?		roche gelato ! <sssss> thought it would be yummy ... well it was n't bad . <sssss> . <sssss> but it was n't super yummy ... the mint chip gelato was much better . <sssss> after a long day at the sea life aquarium in tempe , the shopping mall in scottsdale and the mediocre dinner at wildfish seafood grille , my bf and i thought we would top off the night by sharing a cup with two flavor scoops of gelato . <sssss> it hit the sweet spot alright ... but not exactly a satisfying one . <sssss> for some reason the gelato tasted a lot more like regular ice cream ... which is n't really what i want . <sssss> . <sssss> therefore that could be the reason why i was n't satisfied . <sssss> but it was a good quick fix for those with a sweet tooth . <sssss> . <sssss> = p
?		wow this theater is pretty big and nice ! <sssss> saw the muse concert here this past saturday and it has very clean restrooms and a different concession stands - even though my bf had vip tickets to the lounge with complimentary dinner , i still noted that they had a good selection of concession stands because they had cold stone creamery and that 's rare that i see that in venues - at least the ones that i have been to . <sssss> but of course the prices are still high - but options are nice . <sssss> the complimentary dinner that came with the vip tickets - not sure if it was part of the venue or not but it was pretty darn good all you can eat three types of meatballs , there was salad , bread , vegetable quesadilla and grilled mozzarella caprese . <sssss> our seats were on the front row on the left side of the stage - super duper close ! <sssss> nice to be able to overlook the pit at such a close range . <sssss> the seats were n't too bad to sit on but we stood most of the time anyways . <sssss> overall everything was pretty awesome - muse , food , company and venue .
?		i am a fan of this place . <sssss> you always know what you are going to get . <sssss> good food , cold beer at a decent price and a great view of a tv . <sssss> we watched all the coyotes playoff games here and had no complaints . <sssss> not sure i would go here if not to watch a game , but when there is something we want to watch , this place is the best !
?		i work downtown and chloe 's is by far my favorite . <sssss> every salad is amazing and the food is very fast so it 's great when your in a rush ! <sssss> i prefer to make my own salad and enjoy the fresh ingredients . <sssss> but , when i have ordered from the menu , i have never been disappointed !
?		i ca n't stand this place . <sssss> it 's always filled with a bunch of drunks , it smells , and the karaoke could put me in the grave . <sssss> the last time i went , i was dd and the waitress tried getting a double tip out of my drunk friends . <sssss> i did n't appreciate her taking advantage of my friends -lrb- who had no clue what was going on -rrb- so swore i 'd never be back . <sssss> and , i have n't .
?		there are a lot of things i miss about socal and one of those things is the rich and ever present multicultural food experiences . <sssss> so i 've been on a mission lately and i am quite the happy camper now that we 've found legit pupusas here in phoenix . <sssss> salvadoreno is a neat hole in the wall joint that just screams authenticity with a family run affair and kitschy decor on the wall . <sssss> we arrived early for the dinner hour on a weekday so there was n't any other customers in there at the time . <sssss> a little disconcerting at first had i not read the other yelp reviews . <sssss> the service was pleasant but the food out a little slow . <sssss> not a big deal since everything came out so freshly hot and just prepared . <sssss> with the four of us in our party we managed to try the pupusas in carne asada , revueltas -lrb- pork , beans and cheese -rrb- and the loroco flower -lrb- a squash/okra like veggie -rrb- with cheese . <sssss> the pupusa dough was perfect and perfectly fried as well . <sssss> the accompanying rice was buttery and delicious . <sssss> the homemade tortilla chips were sinfully satisfying and the fried plantains -lrb- a separate order -rrb- added a fabulous twist to each bite of pupusa . <sssss> all in all we were pleased with our meal and i was even more pleased that salvadoreno is fairly close to home . <sssss> we will surely be headed back . <sssss> note to self : the horchata here is not the typical rice and cinnamon drink you 're used to from the mexican joints like albertos . <sssss> here , the menu described it as a morrow seed drink . <sssss> since it was not what i was expecting i had a hard time drinking it but it was good ... just in a different way that 's going to take some getting used to .
?		i have been an avid daphne 's fan for years ever since i discovered this place when i was in college . <sssss> it actually introduce me to greek food in the first place which i have since expanded my horizons to some really wonderful mom and pop greek restaurants . <sssss> but i would still frequent daphne 's when i wanted to satisfy my greek food craving in a pinch . <sssss> their convenient locations and fast service made it ideal when i just wanted to pick up some greek food and head home . <sssss> however , times are a-changin ' and it seems to be extremely obvious at daphne 's nowadays . <sssss> my go to meal here was the shrimp & gyro combo plate . <sssss> it always hit the spot with a little bit of everything . <sssss> but lately , my combo has become a little less satisfying . <sssss> the tzatziki sauce is now super runny/watery when it used to be perfectly creamy/yogurty . <sssss> the rice is less flavorful and less fluffy than it used to be . <sssss> the gyro meat seems to be more on the dry side and the breaded shrimp are n't so breaded anymore . <sssss> even the pita bread seems smaller and thinner . <sssss> i do n't know if these things were simply bad experiences for me or if they are , in fact , changes that were put in place to battle the trying economic times . <sssss> whatever the reason , it just is n't quite the same anymore . <sssss> at one point in time i would n't have batted an eyelash at spending $ 12-14 for my quick greek food fix but lately the plates that are being served just do n't seem worth it anymore . <sssss> it 's not always feasible to go to a sit down greek restaurant because sometimes i just do n't have the time or finances so i really hope that daphne 's will one day be restored to glory in my books .
?		this place is a little tucked away hidden treasure ! <sssss> the venue is awesome with so many areas to sit and enjoy . <sssss> the yelp event i went to had the exclusive use of the large outdoor patio - totally cool , right ? <sssss> it is so open and had great space for the stage , the buffet set up and other little fun attractions set up around the place ... hello beer burro ! <sssss> it immediately had me thinking about what kind of party or celebration i could have on this patio ... guess that means i 'm sold on the venue , huh ? <sssss> the food was great and offered a lot of variety . <sssss> my favorites were the tamale and the desserts . <sssss> the service was excellent and the staff was super friendly . <sssss> definitely a fun place to stop by for a good meal , a good drink or if you want to have a full on fiesta with you and 50 of your closest friends ! <sssss> ole !
?		found this place as we were driving by wondering what we felt like for lunch . <sssss> glad we stopped because this place is a keeper . <sssss> the staff is legit , service is decent considering how busy it was during the lunch rush and the food is just amazing . <sssss> we had our usual fare at any thai place . <sssss> the dishes we use to measure our fondness for the place . <sssss> yellow curry and pad thai . <sssss> the lunch portions are good for a good price . <sssss> the yellow curry had tons of chicken in it and was delicious . <sssss> the pad thai was tasty and peanutty ... just how i like it . <sssss> i 'd like to go back and try their tom kha kai - the coconut milk soup and i wanted to try their dessert - mango with sticky rice - but i was already too full to handle it . <sssss> that 's okay , another reason to go back .
?		perk eatery definitely has its perks . <sssss> it 's convenient and easy to spot , large enough so that a wait on a sunday morning is n't bad at all and has outdoor tables for enjoying a leisurely sunday brunch day . <sssss> plus , they had some pumpkin pancakes that i demolished in 5 seconds . <sssss> good food , good portion sizes , good service . <sssss> the staff here is very friendly ! <sssss> all in all this place made for a pleasant sunday brunch day experience .
?		i am a bonafide food truck fan . <sssss> from the very early days of waiting for the kogi bbq truck in socal way before the entire food truck revolution when groups would be gathered at seemingly odd spots with people curiously wondering what the heck we were waiting for . <sssss> well , it 's not so weird anymore with the rise of numerous food trucks and i was happy to see that phoenix was no exception . <sssss> when i moved from socal , i was really bummed about leaving my food trucks . <sssss> i 'm dead serious . <sssss> but life is a bit brighter now that i 've found several delicious food trucks here in phoenix , including short leash dogs . <sssss> of the few that i have tried so far , sld is definitely the meal that gave me the most bang for my buck . <sssss> my fiance and i tried the lady combination on a bratwurst . <sssss> i did n't know what to expect so when we received our hot dog wrapped in flatbread as opposed to a regular hot dog bun we were pleasantly surprised . <sssss> think about it ... the larger flatbread holding the hot dog can also hold more toppings and thus , more yummy flavor ! <sssss> sld has quite a few options to choose from so it will be fun going back to check out other flavors . <sssss> and as others have pointed out , the service is great . <sssss> the wait time is as expected for a food truck serving lots of customers - no biggie , that 's just how food truck dining rolls - besides , as every foodie knows the good stuff is worth the wait .
?		tott 's is this amazing little neighborhood asian restaurant that has quickly become a favorite of mine ! <sssss> the simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky . <sssss> the service is very friendly and helpful . <sssss> they are always smiling and it actually seems sincere ! <sssss> this is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables . <sssss> there is a nice little patio as well . <sssss> there are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> fill your cup with your beverege of choice -lrb- soft drinks and tea only - no alcohol , hence only 4 stars -rrb- . <sssss> do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-and i do ! <sssss> and because i am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough , i grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the hot chili paste to bring to my table . <sssss> you can , of course , choose chopsticks or a fork . <sssss> i usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks . <sssss> i pretend i know exactly what i am doing . <sssss> but these never work as i can not get enough food into my mouth quick enough so i end up with at least 1 fork . <sssss> i am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table . <sssss> i barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming hot korean with black bean sauce and tofu , or the yellow curry `` panang '' also with tofu . <sssss> you can aslo get chicken , beef or fish . <sssss> the meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places . <sssss> the vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees ' faces . <sssss> i must also confess my longing for pf chang 's or pei wei has certainly diminished after discovering tott 's . <sssss> tott 's even has excellent won ton soup . <sssss> now if they could only get a beer and wine license .
?		i came here once before a long time ago for a birthday bash . <sssss> because of the large size of the party , we were relegated to a large room separate from the rest of the bar . <sssss> at the time i thought it was good , very crowded and fun atmosphere . <sssss> as i was facing a white wall during most of the somewhat uncomfortable evening -lrb- ie my brother 's friends , my grandma and lots of booze -rrb- , i barely noticed all the beautiful woodwork in the main bar area . <sssss> i have been there twice this week . <sssss> once for a nightcap and a second time for take out . <sssss> both were very enjoyable . <sssss> the nightcap was after midnight and a few stragglers were ramped up and kinda vocal , but otherwise a friendly and warm atmosphere . <sssss> i minded my own business and discovered a drawing application i my phone which kept me entertained . <sssss> the vodka soda was fine with fresh lime . <sssss> bartender was friendly and did not try to rush anyone out - it was getting late and yet he was still relaxed and attentive . <sssss> today i picked up a turkey avacado sandwhich and it was great ! <sssss> thinly sliced turkey w / sliced avacado and bacon on a nice roll . <sssss> some tomatoes and lettuce and it was perfect . <sssss> i recommend checking this place out for both the food and the casual atmosphere .
?		i got to check this cool restaurant a few weeks ago . <sssss> the staff could not have been nicer or more professional . <sssss> the sustainable menu is very nicely done and is geared towards comfort foods with varying combinations of textures and flavors not usually found around here . <sssss> to be honest i do not usually go for this type of menu and can be pretty picky . <sssss> that being said , i was really surprised at how much i enjoyed everything i tasted . <sssss> i did not try the roasted bone marrow dish that someone ordered . <sssss> i could not help thinking that my dogs would have loved the bone marrow . <sssss> i also bypassed the `` things in a jar '' section . <sssss> i 'm just not `` there '' yet and will refrain from further comments . <sssss> we sampled many of the popular items that other yelpers had mentioned , i.e. the duck fat fries , the muscles , the roasted beets and of course , the lamb burger . <sssss> they were all deliscious . <sssss> the star of the show was the crispy brussel sprout leaves . <sssss> savory charred edges with a light delicate crunch . <sssss> yummy ! <sssss> i had one of the special entrees which may have been created for the restaurant week . <sssss> it was an amzing halibut topped with asiago . <sssss> there would be no left overs this night . <sssss> we finished up with the bananas foster beignets which were light and toasty with decadently tasting vanilla ice cream and honey . <sssss> i would highly recommend this unique and comfortable experience for anyone looking for something a little different and definitely rewarding !
?		not bad for taiwan food . <sssss> the dumplings were pretty good though . <sssss> the service could have being better ... they need to work on customer service . <sssss> the eggplant and tofu dish was interesting . <sssss> the seafood pancake was n't that impressive . <sssss> hey ... i was very hungry ... so i eat anything .
?		okay so this is a good pizza but not the best . <sssss> i love the ambiance of this place brings , reminding me of a typical portland or eatery . <sssss> love the friendly customer service we got and the beer served on draft was good -lrb- sunbru -rrb- . <sssss> the pizza itself is a wood fire burned style reminiscent of italian pizza . <sssss> the brucheta was good and the ingredients seems of good choice . <sssss> one pizza can be eaten by a hungry brat and even a normal sized girl . <sssss> best way to eat is order different pizzas -lrb- sonny boy is my fav -rrb- and drink beer or wine with friends and comrades .
?		ah very good . <sssss> i love the biriyani with lamb and chicken ... lamb curry was n't bad either . <sssss> the garlic naan was on par . <sssss> oh also it seems they have shrimp and beef curry ... nomnomnomnom . <sssss> wait i thought the cow was holly ... nomnomnomnom .
?		gem in the middle of the desert ... i was surprised how chic this place was . <sssss> lanterns , nice furniture , and cleanliness . <sssss> great service and a knowledgeable waitress ... thumbs up . <sssss> we had the veggie mushroom and some fish balls and meat . <sssss> half with hot chilli peppers and one side mild . <sssss> oh and we had bean curd , which was freshly cut . <sssss> it was delicious ... me sweating as i eat the hot side of the pot . <sssss> if you have n't tried hot pot ... this is a good place to start . <sssss> oh and great hip music playing ... good for young people .
?		i ran into this place while looking for an asian market . <sssss> i thought the name was funny but it seemed it got good enough reviews ... so why the hell not . <sssss> i tried their egg noodle soup with everything on it including fish ball , salmon , pork , chicken and what not ... i was blown away ... this i was very good and by far the best i had . <sssss> my gf tried the pho ... well ... nothing special but seem like the same old pho compared to other established pho places . <sssss> also their appetizers ... i tried their pork sausage rolls ... well they were okay . <sssss> overall good service and fair price.g approved !
?		yea i being to many bww ... this one was average good . <sssss> the wings are always a good choice . <sssss> i kind of hate how they did the menu -lrb- no more flat bread ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> good drink menu but can be better . <sssss> i just feel the set up as so close together ... need more space . <sssss> anyways there are other bars to watch sports on .
?		loved this place ! <sssss> not only was the food delicious , and cheap , but a few of the waitresses were pretty hot . <sssss> sorry ladies , but i 'm a guy and sometimes i ca n't help but notice . <sssss> will be back next time i 'm in town .
?		i 'm not sure what to say about this place . <sssss> i 'm from vegas , and i was going to run home and give this place 4 stars , but then my girlfriend and i got sick . <sssss> now i was n't feeling awesome the morning we had lunch here , but she was just fine . <sssss> coincidence , maybe ? <sssss> or did we get sick from the food here ? <sssss> not sure . <sssss> that aside , the food was definitely above average . <sssss> it was n't the best jewish deli we had been to , but it was a pretty cool find considering we were driving down the road talking about going to a non-chain sandwich joint when we saw the sign for a deli . <sssss> goldman 's did not disappoint in that regard .
?		i think we ordered the wrong items . <sssss> i had a slice of sicilian pizza , my date had the spaghetti , and we split a salad . <sssss> salad was just ok , pizza and pasta were decent but nothing to get super excited about . <sssss> if i lived next door i 'd frequent this place , but i probably wo n't see this place again . <sssss> maybe we should have just gotten a regular slice of pizza ?
?		this place is a hidden gem in the city of glendale . <sssss> it 's in a grungy strip mall that most people would not stop or give a second look at . <sssss> but , once you step in , the restaurant gives off a nice ambiance . <sssss> the food is delicious . <sssss> we got the pad thai and the green curry , which was more than enough to feed 3 people for lunch . <sssss> they dishes are approximately $ 10 to $ 15 each . <sssss> they even have a brown rice option for the more health conscious . <sssss> our mango sticky rice at the end was a little lacking though . <sssss> the amount was rather economical compared to its price . <sssss> for entrees , this place is solid and authentic , but i would probably go elsewhere for dessert . <sssss> we ate at rather an odd hour so the service was okay . <sssss> not spectacular but not lacking either .
?		this is the best steakhouse -- i am in love . <sssss> everything is amazing . <sssss> we started off with the ahi tuna tartare and it was delicious ! <sssss> i absolutely enjoyed every bite . <sssss> and the bone-in fillet is a must . <sssss> there is nothing quite like it . <sssss> the marrow juice glazes the cut giving it a unique flavorful juice . <sssss> next was the lobster mashed potato and that was huge - mixed with butter and garlic with real chunks of lobster . <sssss> we had sauteed mushrooms for sides . <sssss> the amount of food for two people was overwhelming . <sssss> and for someone , like myself , who does not like to take leftovers back -- we attempted to devour everything and still managed to save enough room for the chocolate raspberry cake . <sssss> thick dark chocolate cake topped with chocolate syrup and a couple strawberries . <sssss> delicious .
?		for dinner , we started off with the arugula & sour apple with balsamic onions , blue cheese & candied walnuts . <sssss> that was deliciously done with just the right amount of blue cheese for someone like me who is not a huge fan . <sssss> every piece of arugula was covered with just the right amount of dressing also so it maintained a fresh taste without being overbearing . <sssss> i have the miso glazed chilean sea bass with crispy oyster mushroom , which was good but probably not the best choice in the house . <sssss> the texture just did n't seem quite right . <sssss> i am more used to japanese restaurants that cut the sea bass in thin slices then cover it with miso rather than having faint miso accents on the fish . <sssss> the modern burger is much better with your choice of cheese and made to the way you want them too . <sssss> oh , they also have amazing bread - bacon potato and rosemary paired with two different whipped butter spreads . <sssss> delicious .
?		yes , add me to the list of fans of this fine establishment . <sssss> i ordered the carne asada tacos and the jamaica -lrb- uh , it was mui authentico served with a punch ladle -rrb- and fell in love with the beach bar atmosphere . <sssss> definitely recommend .
?		stumpy 's is a family-owned restaurant just off the 51 freeway and northern . <sssss> i love them . <sssss> they have a zany-garlicky homemade house italian dressing to top their crunchy salads . <sssss> yes , they told me you can buy it by the bottle , if you end up loving it as much as i do . <sssss> their pizza ? <sssss> delicious crust , tons of cheese and generous toppings . <sssss> their baked wings ? <sssss> tangy and delicious , perfect for dipping into their homemade bleu cheese dressing . <sssss> even though they are normally crazy-busy on a friday night , they still called my cell just to make sure i received my order and enjoyed it . <sssss> online ordering , too . <sssss> http://pizzabystumpys.com/ just go . <sssss> -lrb- closed on sundays . <sssss> -rrb-
?		perfect ... really .
?		fifth & wine is a nice wine bar in old town . <sssss> the staff was great , very helpful . <sssss> in fact , they sat down with us repeatedly throughout our visit to check on us , tell us a little bit about the place and the menu . <sssss> the bruschetta is delicious , inventive and reasonably priced . <sssss> they only have one sauvignon blanc , but the one they have is pretty good . <sssss> lots of cozy couch seating in addition to the bar and table set-ups . <sssss> great happy hour . <sssss> check it .
?		yeah , well , like i need to review lux . <sssss> either you love acid green or you hate it . <sssss> ditto with the atmosphere of lux . <sssss> i personally adore dave , one of the excellent baristas who moonlights as a photo assistant when he is n't making perfect americanos . <sssss> it 's very hipster , very busy , the djs have computers , but let 's not kid ourselves ... everyone in the place does -lrb- mac , os 10.5.2 , in fact -rrb- . <sssss> the pastries , scones and other delights have no protective glass covering , bake sale style -lrb- unless they are frosted cupcakes , which drives one of my friends crazy because he 's a bit of a germaphobe -rrb- . <sssss> the yogurt parfaits are probably the best i 've had . <sssss> maple ? <sssss> oh . <sssss> so . <sssss> good . <sssss> if you want to meet a writer , this is the place to go . <sssss> if you want to avoid a writer or other creative individual , well , you probably will want to order an unusual soda pop at pané next door and call it a day . <sssss> mmmm , i can totally smell the coffee grinding as i write this . <sssss> they recently changed up their tea and it 's delightful , particularly with a squirt of agave nectar . <sssss> agave nectar or not , never a dull moment .
?		durant 's is an icon . <sssss> every photographer in phoenix can show you at least one portrait of a political figure or celebrity they have shot in these hallowed -lrb- red flocked -rrb- walls . <sssss> every single person you come into contact with as you walk through the kitchen into the restaurant says hello to you . <sssss> i just have one more thing to say : when you order a beer at the bar it comes topped with a toothpick skewered with meat and cheese . <sssss> respect .
?		stacy 's smokehouse is delicious . <sssss> i tried it today with a friend for lunch . <sssss> after eating there , i 'm not sure why it is n't completely packed out during lunch . <sssss> i ordered the bbq beef brisket sandwich , it came double-wrapped and full of juicy deliciousness . <sssss> you know when you get the best part of the brisket ? <sssss> a mix of crispy bits and shredded pieces ? <sssss> it 's that . <sssss> plus lots of tasty smokey bbq sauce , tucked into a fresh bun . <sssss> i ordered the large , and it was the perfect size . <sssss> my friend ordered the small bbq chicken sandwich and was quite pleased with hers . <sssss> -lrb- for the difference in size , think large costco hamburger bun and the small was more like a mcdonald 's hamburger bun size . <sssss> -rrb- hers was small chunks of chicken swimming in bbq sauce . <sssss> as far as the ambiance goes , think of a mix between lo-lo 's and carolina 's .
?		bad skinny margarita and just o.k. food . <sssss> not a fan
?		organic and tasty . <sssss> went there for my daughter 's going away event . <sssss> they were so sweet and gave us the big room .
?		i definitely did n't love this restaurant like other `` yelpers '' . <sssss> i do like the idea that all of the owners spots are right in the same area , especially 3 right in a block 's distance and another right up the street . <sssss> got the wings to start , they do have a good amount of chicken on them , but the sauce did n't do it for me . <sssss> i also tried the pizza and hamburger . <sssss> i have read before that they have the best burger in the area . <sssss> i did not think it was the best , but i also did n't order the green chili burger , which was the one i read so much about . <sssss> to me the pizza was very basic , but i know others have enjoyed it . <sssss> i was not completely disappointed with my experience , but i 'm not rushing to go back either .
?		when you come here be ready to eat ! <sssss> for those of you who do not know how this place works ... you get a bowl and basically go to a buffet style set up where you pack raw meats and uncooked veggies into your bowl . <sssss> you can put as much as you want , i would n't exactly say fit in your bowl , because the food is always overflowing . <sssss> once you have loaded up your bowl you pick the sauce -lrb- s -rrb- you want to use . <sssss> there are recipes for different kinds of sauces available for you . <sssss> after that , your food is cooked infront of you in about 3-5 minutes . <sssss> after that you take it to your table and enjoy ... i would suggest filling your bowl up with a lot of noodles , even if your bowl is completely filled .
?		what an awesome restaurant ! <sssss> it is a pretty small place , they can probably seat around 25 , but i had reservations and was able to sit at the counter . <sssss> normally , i would n't want to sit at the counter for dinner , but i was able to watch the chefs cook the meals , which was very cool . <sssss> one of the chefs was very outgoing and the service was very good . <sssss> i had the tuna tartare to start , which was excellent . <sssss> it had some spice to it , which added so much more to this appetizer . <sssss> i also tried the mexican street corn and the soft tacos . <sssss> they were both pretty good . <sssss> i would like to go again and try some of the other things on the menu and it seems like they change their menu fairly often . <sssss> for dessert the chef convinced me to have the banana bread . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> it came with a vanilla dipping sauce which was awesome . <sssss> overall i would love to go again . <sssss> it is not very expensive too , which is always nice , especially in scottsdale .
?		i could n't stand this place ! <sssss> i am actually very surprised other people gave it a good review . <sssss> aside from the service being very poor the food was nothing too exciting . <sssss> i did like the spicy chicken and rice soup , however they brought me out the wrong soup the first time . <sssss> i was also brought out the wrong drink too ! <sssss> my date ordered a salad which was not bad , but not very good . <sssss> there was too much dressing and it made everything else in the salad very soggy . <sssss> i had the sweet & sour chicken , but was not impressed at all . <sssss> the food is not the worst , but i can get better chinese food down the street from this restaurant . <sssss> i do think the service was so bad that it did bring down the rating , i did get a laugh however because they seemed to mess up on everything we ordered like we were on a hidden camera show .
?		this location usually has a wait during peak hours , but that is because it 's tasty and worth the wait . <sssss> i have never had anything that i did n't like . <sssss> i have tried the pablo picasso mexican salad , which has a really nice chipotle dressing . <sssss> i have also had their artichoke dip , which is huge , and pretty good . <sssss> i think my favorite thing is their italian gold wings , it has a great honey mustard sauce and there are never any stingy wings . <sssss> also great waffles fries . <sssss> they have a ton of options for pizza styles too , i have never got one that i did n't enjoy .
?		i have been to butters twice , and thought it was great both times ! <sssss> i have been for lunch , and had the turkey burger with sweet potatoes fries , and for breakfast , where i had an omelette and pancakes . <sssss> both meals were really tasty . <sssss> the prices are also very reasonable and the service was n't great , but was n't awful . <sssss> the patio seating was great on the morning that i went .
?		not what i expected . <sssss> the food was nothing special , especially compared to other fox restaurants . <sssss> the restaurant itself is a nice place to go with a group of people . <sssss> the margaritas and mojitos were alright , but there are definitely places to find better in the area . <sssss> i was not crazy about the food either . <sssss> overall this is not a horrible restaurant by any means , i just went in expecting better food and drink . <sssss> they do have outside seating which could make the ambiance much better for a larger group of people .
?		perhaps and it is very possible i do not understand the concept of restaurant week . <sssss> it seemed it was or is to attract potential customers with less than average prices for above average food and service , you know so we will come back when we feel like spending what it normally takes . <sssss> we went to kincaids because a friend of mine wanted to try the place and this seemed like the right time . <sssss> our dining companions are referred to as m & m . <sssss> first off , how does this place stay in business ? <sssss> the location is desolate when no games or other venues are in play . <sssss> nothing to do or see before or after eating here , too bad . <sssss> we were greeted and seated by a nice guy . <sssss> at first we were placed in a booth , it seems to be the choice of most . <sssss> unfortunately it does not fit my legs so we moved to a table . <sssss> we made a reservation , but it was apparent it was not needed as they were not busy . <sssss> no one in the bar , and only about six tables or groups in the dining room . <sssss> our server tina greeted us with a big smile and ready to take our drink orders along with telling of her favourite appetizers . <sssss> gus and i both ordered a classic mojito , something we have never had . <sssss> one sip and i could feel accelerated tooth decay taking place . <sssss> god what an overly sweet drink , and not in a good way . <sssss> neither of us drank this experiment in sugar . <sssss> our dinner companions ordered something more in the line of an adult drink and enjoyed very much . <sssss> i found out about an hour ago gus wanted to order off of the main menu but did not want to appear as a party pooper so he stuck with the rw menu . <sssss> i too felt the same way and this is a good example of not speaking up and finding you should have . <sssss> we both had the maytag blue cheese salad , yes it was cold , and yes it was crisp but uninspired . <sssss> m & m one maytag and one clam chowder , neither made comment as to being good or bad . <sssss> we then went on to the bacon wrapped kobe meatloaf , mashed potatoes , mushroom gravy and sweet-sour - red cabbage , this being 18 dollars on the main menu . <sssss> again uninspired comes to mind , we make better meatloaf at home and our gravy has flavour . <sssss> the cabbage was neither sweet nor sour but a rather dull flavour of what it should have been . <sssss> our deserts were the chocolate cake and a key lime pie . <sssss> neither were the best or worst we have had . <sssss> m & m had the salmon and chicken , again no mention of enjoyment . <sssss> i know it sounds from what i just wrote that it was pretty horrible . <sssss> it was n't it was just not at the top of anyone 's game . <sssss> the restaurant is a nice looking place with friendly folks who seem to be rushing around getting things done for a non crowded place . <sssss> the intervals between courses were a bit longer than they should have been , but did not upset any of us since we enjoyed our company and conversation . <sssss> the only way i can think of to describe the quality of the food is that it was cooked by a line cook and not a chef . <sssss> again i could be wrong , but it looks as though some restaurants were added to the list after we went to kincaids , some offering an actual steak at the steak houses . <sssss> kincaids offered the least they could . <sssss> polishing makes most things shine , this place needs a good hot waxing . <sssss> too many places in phoenix that shine to make this a place on ones rotation . <sssss> one last thing , gus was up all night with an upset stomach . <sssss> he never gets upset tummies so we suspect something here was not settling well with him .
?		have been several times over the years and have found each visit a nice comfortable place to get a decent meal . <sssss> good service , good food and right price .
?		bruce and i went to look at one of our listings in that part of town last week , god what a horrible little home . <sssss> well we decided we should reward ourselves for putting our senses in such shock that we decided to go to mimi 's . <sssss> bruce being such a picky eater he does not have many places he will go . <sssss> and by picky i mean odd . <sssss> any-road i have not been in several years and it was just as i remembered . <sssss> a nice filling sandwich and cup of soup . <sssss> it was all good and the service was just spiffy too . <sssss> in fact when i asked where the rest room is , i was taken by hand and led there . <sssss> a little strange actually , but great service .
?		ikea is fun to walk through , but for me that is the extent of it . <sssss> my personal style does not include the sterile college dorm look . <sssss> but it is fun to see what odd little things they have in the bins . <sssss> now that i think of it , i did by some cable lighting for my garage there a few years ago .
?		i met a client here for lunch yesterday . <sssss> it was his choice and since i really enjoy working with him and consider him a friend ; i figured why not . <sssss> easy parking that 's for sure . <sssss> nice big dining room that does not feel cramped , seemed clean too . <sssss> a lot to choose from as far as food goes . <sssss> the wait person was smiling and checked on our drinks often . <sssss> what i ate was decent , but did not eat much since i was talking and talking and talking . <sssss> so it for me is worth another visit when i am not planning on talking so much and get to try more of the food . <sssss> so yeah i will be back ... ...
?		i have had food form this restaurant a few times over an extended period of time . <sssss> i have never eaten at zoe 's it was always take out and i did not do the picking up of the food . <sssss> so no comment on the structure or service . <sssss> it is not horrible , but also not quite good either . <sssss> very uninspired in all foods i have tasted . <sssss> sorta like eating dry white bread . <sssss> we ordered as a group each time i ate , so i just figured it wo n't kill me so why not . <sssss> really a lousy reason to spend too much money for bland , but there you go .
?		this strip mall is probably the busiest corner among the rest . <sssss> it has few of my favorite places in the same plaza , changing hands , trader joe 's , express mie , and wildflower breads . <sssss> i love changing hands for their book events , authors signings , amazing selection of bargain books , and other fun gift items . <sssss> i wish i live a little closer ...
?		nobu offers japanese fusion cuisine in an elegant modern but yet traditional japanese setting . <sssss> there were numerous courses of beautifully prepared and imaginatively presented food on small plates the standard japanese isakaya -lrb- tapas -rrb- . <sssss> my favorites were teeter tots which were absolutely incredible . <sssss> the spicy miso sauce was very addictive , and fried tofu with green onions on top is excellent . <sssss> the soft shell crab sandwich was good , but i think i like it more in a sushi roll . <sssss> as for dessert , after seeing everyone 's order , i just could n't resist not to order one for myself . <sssss> i have ordered the orange-almond fritters , the smell of the orange in the warm fritters are splendid , and tasted even better . <sssss> the exotic flavor of the jasmine tea ice cream was very refreshing ; just wish they have another scoop on it . <sssss> i took the pork belly buns home , and tried the next day . <sssss> the braised pork belly buns with preserved mustard cabbage vegetable remained me of a chinese-style dish that my dad loves . <sssss> actually , i preferred something different than the fatty pork belly in the bun . <sssss> i just do n't like the texture of the fatty part of the meat . <sssss> overall , i had a superb uye dinner at nobu . <sssss> i am glad that they participated in yelp eats week . <sssss> i hope they will be back for next yelp eats week . <sssss> thanks so much for organizing this , lindsey !
?		my favorite things at tj : inexpensive wine selections desserts cheeses coffees chips naan breads -lrb- try the curry one if you have n't -rrb- yummy food samples flowers and plants -lrb- so fresh -rrb- friendly staffs
?		love the music here ! <sssss> the live band was amazing . <sssss> i was n't amused on the overpriced martinis . <sssss> ladies get in free and guys pay $ 10 . <sssss> i will go back just the music !
?		this place gets really busy even on a thursday night . <sssss> the line was out the door . <sssss> we decided to do the to-go route , and seat outside so the kids can run around . <sssss> it was my sister 's b-day , which got a free meal -lrb- $ 12.00 value . <sssss> -rrb- anything off the menu . <sssss> bbq ribs were tender and tasty . <sssss> hot link sausage must have ! <sssss> chicken breast - save money and order more ribs ! <sssss> cheesy potatoes - yum ! <sssss> turkey jalapeno sausage - not recommended - save your money and order more hot links sausages . <sssss> unlimited sauces !!!!
?		thank you a for inviting me to dine at coup des tartes . <sssss> i love that it was a byob place . <sssss> we were told that we only have 45 minutes to dine due to all tables were reserved . <sssss> that means to eat quickly and dash out . <sssss> we seat in a little corner , but i ca n't help admiring the french elegant decor all around us . <sssss> we had ordered the roquefort salad , mixed of organic greens , roasted apples , dried figs , toasted hazelnuts & premier cru roquefort . <sssss> this was probably the best salad i had so far . <sssss> it was that good ! <sssss> we thought it was funny that they would have a dish named `` jose pasta '' at a french restaurant . <sssss> so we decided to give it a try . <sssss> it was linguine tossed in a chili garlic cream sauce with vegetables and parmigiano-reggiano . <sssss> you can add chicken for $ 5 more . <sssss> the linguines were well cooked with light cream sauce and a little kick . <sssss> i think it 's still missing something in the dish , but i 'm not sure what . <sssss> it does go well with the wine . <sssss> according to the waitress , the chef had made the dish for himself one night , but the employees tried and liked , so now it 's on the menu . <sssss> after the main course , we had ordered the mocha pecan tarte . <sssss> it was a petite warm pecan tart with chocolate , kahlua , and vanilla ice cream on the side . <sssss> this was not meant to be shared . <sssss> sorry , a ! <sssss> : -rrb- shortly after the dessert arrived , we did n't have much time to enjoy it . <sssss> we were told by one of the waitresses that our time is almost up . <sssss> if you want to enjoy full french experience here make sure you have reservation .
?		sunday , may 5th , green tea ice with condensed milk topped with green tea mochi & red bean . <sssss> the green tea was really refreshing and tasted like green tea . <sssss> mochi was chewy with red bean made exactly how i like it . <sssss> monday , may 6th - original and taro with condensed milk , red bean , black sesame . <sssss> this combo was n't my favorite . <sssss> the black sesame sounded better than it was for me . <sssss> the original with condensed milk was the classic , tasted so creamy and so good . <sssss> friday , may 10 - it was a busy night . <sssss> there was a long line and one cash register . <sssss> they might want to consider opening another cash register to handle the weekend crowd . <sssss> i think i found my favorite combo . <sssss> it 's the thai tea with condensed milk and red bean . <sssss> thai tea unbelievable , highly recommend ! <sssss> a friend suggested to try the almond milk tea with almond pudding . <sssss> i love almond milk tea but never had it with almond pudding . <sssss> a lot of places make this tea way too sweet . <sssss> this drink was made perfectly ! <sssss> i think i have an addiction now . <sssss> i do not need an intervention yet , because i will be returning soon to mix more combos . <sssss> = -rrb-
?		great burger ! <sssss> love the fact that you have so many add on options for your 1 or 2 patty burger . <sssss> the fries are good too ... you can actually taste the potato , not just oil and salt . <sssss> overall with fries and a drink the cost for lunch is $ 10.00 + so it 's not the cheapest place to grab lunch but i would have to say it 's worth it . <sssss> i 've been to this site a few times and have had great service everytime .
?		nothing bad to say ! <sssss> however i am embarrassed to say that after living here for 11 years this is my first time going here . <sssss> i am going to frequent this place as i found out they have one close to my house -lrb- pv mall -rrb- had the pastrami sandwich with 1000 dressing and sauerkraut . <sssss> and the matzo ball soup all i say is , mmmm !!!! <sssss> ca n't wait to try breakfast ... they even serve bloody marys and mimosas for those extra hungover weekend moments .
?		olive oil has a ubiquitous influence in the foodie world , but how much do we know about what goes into producing a fine extra virgin ? <sssss> the queen creek olive mill is where all of your questions will be answered . <sssss> begin your visit with a $ 5 tour , which `` walks '' you through the growing process , and what makes queen creek an excellent location for olive groves . <sssss> why , although not organically certified , these olives are not treated with chemicals or pesticides . <sssss> find out about the olive harvest , why there is no such thing as a black olive , and why the mill 's master blender carefully and meticulously supervises each harvest from begin to end . <sssss> the tour takes you into the heart of the operation , the presses . <sssss> all olive oil is extracted by mechanical means , keeping its integrity . <sssss> in the pressing room , you can sample varieties of olive oils as well as olives . <sssss> after experimenting for over a decade with different olives , the result is a grove of over a dozen varieties of olives . <sssss> their extra virgin has a distinct flavor due to a few practices inherent in their harvesting . <sssss> olives are harvested by hand -lrb- no fallen olives -rrb- and cold pressed within 24 hours . <sssss> due to late harvests between the months of september and december , their olive oil has a fruity yet buttery taste . <sssss> and you can sample all of their infused oil at the olive oil bar . <sssss> i highly recommend the meyer lemon for dipping and cooking , as well as the white truffle oil . <sssss> for baking their chocolate olive oil and vanilla bean are amazing , and can replace the need for regular vegetable or cooking oils . <sssss> the differences in moisture and flavor are astounding ! <sssss> ~ there is a reason why they claim that `` you are literally buying one of the best olive oils in the world . '' <sssss> along with a plethora of cooking oils , there are body care products made with their evoo . <sssss> the body creams leave my skin moist and fresh for nearly a day , the lip balms are also exceptional . <sssss> the cafe has a fresh assortment of sandwiches and salads . <sssss> although the bruschettas look great , they are tiny pieces of extremely dry and crusty bread , the various toppings lacking in freshness and flavor - unfortunately . <sssss> but the most important thing to try on your sojourn here is the olive oil cake you will never have cake that is more filled with flavor , more buttery , and for lack of a better word - more luscious . <sssss> wines from around the world can also be purchased by the bottle in their wine section . <sssss> a fantastic place for a date , a relaxing lunch , an education ...
?		with so many mexican and modern mexican restaurants in the valley , one wonders how a new addition to the fold can raise the bar . <sssss> i feel that taberna does just that . <sssss> with chef alex padilla 's modern spin on mexican with central americal influences , food that is artfully prepared and plated , and flavors to entice and enhance , this is one destination for your tastebuds . <sssss> the cocktails and even non-alcoholic offerings are made fresh , and are a sweet way to begin the culinary fiesta . <sssss> the `` sangria de taberna '' was excellent , served with fresh fruit and just the right combination of wine , brandy , and juice . <sssss> all margaritas are hand crafted and feature freshly squeezed juices - a must for a decent margarita . <sssss> they have a tremendous assortment of non alcholic offerings as well - fresh pressed juices combined with spring water and simple syrup . <sssss> we sampled pineapple , lemon , and watermelon - and each came with a juicy slice of fruit . <sssss> these were delicious ! <sssss> as we were here during lunch hour , the menu had a smaller selection , but did not sacrifice on flavor . <sssss> in an unconvential move by me , i ordered the fajita burger . <sssss> this burger was highly recommended by the server , and i am so happy that i sampled this delectable `` torta . '' <sssss> -lrb- the spicy black beans with cortija were also an excellent side ! <sssss> -rrb- a well seasoned and juicy skirt steak , with cheeses and peppers , doused in a garlic aoli , left beautiful memories in my mouth . <sssss> we also delighted in the braised chicken with ranchera sauce and epazote crema . <sssss> chicken was also juicy and flavorful , the sauce and crema a delicious complement to the chicken . <sssss> lunch menu offerings were `` taberna tacos , '' street style tacos with ingredients such as grilled fish or chicken and chorizo . <sssss> enchiladas and grilled sandwhiches were also on the menu . <sssss> average price for an entree at luch is $ 12 , but the fresh ingredients and flavors are worth the price . <sssss> from the blue tortilla chips and plantains served with their flavorful salsas , to the flavorful entrees , this is a must try for mexican food enthusiasts .
?		not much needs to be said about a bar devoted to being besotted . <sssss> the various signs with catch phrases and college colloquialisms attest to this . <sssss> `` i like your pants . <sssss> especially on my floor , '' says it all . <sssss> perhaps a devoted patron of this bar would respond with '' do n't take life too seriously , you 're not going to make it out alive , '' another turn of phrase that can be found mounted with rocky point pride in this establishment . <sssss> the atmosphere is meant to be very casual , laid back - like you were spending your spring break in puerto penasco . <sssss> but the similarities end there . <sssss> quite possibly home of the worst house margarita - so full of the synthetic and syrupy sweet and sour mix that there is nothing more discernible . <sssss> despite there being a full bar , the bartenders have little knowledge of cocktail recipes - i would recommend ordering beer by the bottle . <sssss> although a full menu is available , there is no better word to describe the food than ... bad . <sssss> if you have ever had a bonafide street taco in mexico , then you will be dismally disappointed by their poor imitation . <sssss> one would assume that it is quite difficult to mess up a taco , but here they got everything wrong in both the preparation of the meat and the salsa that shamefully tried to mask the poor taste of the meat . <sssss> there is no need to dissect the menu or its gustatory offerings any further , as dos is quite frankly a place to play beer pong and get wasted . <sssss> it does offer a variety of entertainments such as tuesday comedy nights and wednesday 's texas hold 'em . <sssss> bean bag tournaments are also held here . <sssss> dos certainly caters to a specific crowd , i am not one of those that feel as though they still want to be on spring break .
?		not just a fan . <sssss> a huge fan . <sssss> a large kobe burger fan . <sssss> i started my night here , on the dazzling patio , infront of a fireplace , with the game playing on an overheard plasma screen . <sssss> i was lounging back against the cushioned seats , a pillow providing the ultimate in comfort on each side of me . <sssss> and i held a `` jalisco flower '' -lrb- hornitos anejo tequila , grapefruit , st.germaine elderdlower , sparkling wine -rrb- in hand . <sssss> then my entree arrived . <sssss> a gorgeous , succulent , flavorful kobe burger with parmesan truffle fries , and blue cheese fondue to dip it in . <sssss> my tastebuds , my heart , my very soul , melted as i took that first bite . <sssss> i was in love by the time i dipped my first fry into the divine bleu cheese fondue . <sssss> i do n't regret my decision to eat a burger this night . <sssss> despite the melange of fabulous and priced to pain steaks such as midwest prime beef , all natural american raised beef , and many seafood entrees . <sssss> it was one of the best i had savored in the valley . <sssss> for the discerning beef eater , there is a featured heart brand akaushi filet for $ 78 , or snake river farms qagyu rib eye for $ 62 . <sssss> seafood specialties include maple bacon glazed scottish salmon , miso glazed chilean sea bass , and day boat scallops . <sssss> a la carte sides include mascarpone creamed corn , cauliflower gratin , roasted brussel sprouts , sweet potato purée with burnt marshallows , baked potatoes , and classic man n cheese . <sssss> my burger was more than enough to satisfy my cravings , but so overjoyed that i had the sweet potato puree . <sssss> it was like thanksgiving around a campfire , with s'mores . <sssss> and if it had not been for my most wonderful dinner partner , i never would have sampled the incredible lobster chowder . <sssss> a seafood party in my mouth . <sssss> this definitely goes on my list of places to impress your palate , and/or your date . <sssss> to note : perhaps the modern steak craze will die down once it has worn off its nouveau , but currently the place is packed to the rafters with diners , drinkers , and singles on the weekends . <sssss> reservations are a must , four stomachs an even larger imperative .
?		`` happiness comes in small doses , folks , '' as the venerable denis leary once touted . <sssss> happiness comes in small doses at the bamboo club , as well . <sssss> you have to give them happiness kudos for doing something that no other food purveyor in town does : an 8 hour happy hour with a flurry of food items from $ 2 - $ 6 ! <sssss> `` happiness hour '' is every day from 4p-close . <sssss> i have had more than half the items here , and it is decidedly so that they made my happy . <sssss> the following appetizers are $ 2 : macadamia nut chicken skewers fish taco $ 3 : sesame honey ribs asian bbq pork edamame halibut skewers $ 4 coconut shrimp seared ahi tuna asian shrimp cocktail steamed mussels crispy crab wontons pot stickers . <sssss> select martinis such as the ginger cherry tini are $ 6 lunch has amazing deals as well : from 11a-4p $ 9,95 gets you soup or salad , appetizer , entrée , and rice the menu of food looks overwhelmingly light and healthy , offering something for every taste bud . <sssss> you can order sizzling , flaming , wok 'd , and steamed here . <sssss> for the health concscious there are salads such as the strawberry chicken . <sssss> halibut , sea bass , steak , tofu , peking duck , and curry all come together on this menu . <sssss> i come here solely for `` happiness , '' as asian cuisine is not my bag . <sssss> i recommend it as a good spot for lunch and `` happiness . ''
?		for a coffee joint there is a surprisingly large amount of space . <sssss> local art lines the walls -lrb- and it 's for sale -rrb- , a few locally made items such as coffee cup cozies are also available . <sssss> i was happy to find that along with a gorgeous array of pastries ranging from vegan chocolate torte to chocolate pecan pie , there was also an assortment of breakfast and lunch items . <sssss> not only does urban beans feature a sunday brunch with omelet bar every sunday , but there is a wonderful assortment of breakfast items to be enjoyed . <sssss> farm egg sandwiches on toasted english muffins , market quiche , granola parfait , scones , and even gluten free vegan english muffins . <sssss> furthermore , lunch selections boast a fabulous spread of sandwiches such as the turkey , brie , cranberry sandwich with a fabulous mango cranberry chutney and fresh arugula . <sssss> for the salad selection i highly recommend the quinoa mediterranean salad with mini tomatoes , persian cucumbers , feta cheese , fresh mint , and their citrus house vinaigrette . <sssss> a more esoteric selection on the menu is the pear and arugula melt , with fresh pears , arugula , fontina cheese , and a balsamic raspberry reduction . <sssss> average price of a sandwhich is about $ 8 , salads and quiches range from $ 4.50 - $ 7.50 . <sssss> melts are about $ 8 - $ 9 . <sssss> i have only sampled the chai latte here , which i thought was beautifully rendered . <sssss> coffee and espresso drinks are abundant here , prices are very reasonable . <sssss> great lunch spot , perfect for browsing the internet with their free wi-fi on a lazy sunday .
?		`` the truth is inside '' states the wooden plaque mounted above the unassuming entrance to kaz bar . <sssss> my first time walking in here felt like going to a speakeasy , and i was to be the newly appointed member to its secret society . <sssss> from stetson one could easily pass it and not know it was there . <sssss> `` like all good speakeasys , the entrance is hidden in the rear '' i have been coming here for 7 years . <sssss> many first dates , even my mother has shared a spot at the bar with me . <sssss> when passing into the realm of truth , one immediately forgets phoenix and the sunshine . <sssss> one is transported to a darker and sultrier place . <sssss> it smells of flatbreads and wine . <sssss> one may feel teleported to a gothic 17th century wine cellar in eastern europe . <sssss> lazy , high backed couches fill the room , large rustic tables accomodate larger groups in an adjoining partition . <sssss> wine barrels , wood , and stone line its walls . <sssss> a fireplace and candle light brings the right amount of ambiance and mysticism . <sssss> picking up their wine list is like opening a reader 's digest . <sssss> wine by the bottle or wine by the glass , this place has over 3000 selections from all over the globe . <sssss> they offer iiventive wine flights ranging from cherry blossom chinese to sparkling red shiraz . <sssss> . <sssss> rare wines , fine wines , even transylvanian wines are found here -lrb- fangs included -rrb- . <sssss> you can sample anything here , you can make special requests . <sssss> the list of spirits is extensive as well . <sssss> from eastern european cocktails , to grappa , to potato vodka , to belgian beer , all is represented here to provide its visitors the ultimate bacchinalia . <sssss> the bartenders are very knowledgeable , so a seat at the bar is worth coming here if you are new to imbibing wine and spirits . <sssss> best time to show is after they open at 6p , or on tuesday nights . <sssss> why , you say ? <sssss> this little speakeasy also happens to have a lively music scene . <sssss> sundays , mondays , and thursdays there is live music . <sssss> be hypnotised and seduced by flamenco on sundays , and be wooed and wowed by local jazz legend , margot reed , on mondays . <sssss> if wine and jazz are not satisfying enough , the noshes served here until 2a will make you feel complete . <sssss> cheese fondue , cheese and bread plates , antipasto , polish sausages , and mouth watering egyptian flatbreads are the perfect complement to your wine . <sssss> i have a deep and burning passion for the flavor combinations on this particular kind of flatbread served here : baja chipotle-orange rock shrimp , buffalo mozzarella , pepitas , smoked gouda , cilantro ... brilliant ! <sssss> if you want to seduce your date by way of chocolate , i recommend the bittersweet chocolate or fleur de sel caramel fondue , which comes with housemade marshmallows , passion fruit cream puffs , pound cake , coconut macaroons , and fruits . <sssss> pure decadence . <sssss> pure bacchinalia . <sssss> i mean , i think this is the way that the god of wine would have wanted it ...
?		okay so i 've been coming to this vig location even before it `` officially '' opened . <sssss> i will say that i have never been to another location . <sssss> so i 'm just basing my experience on this location and this location only . <sssss> i am a bit spoiled because i live in walking distance as well . <sssss> the patio is amazing , during the beautiful weather days this is the spot downtown to be . <sssss> at night they have heaters both the propane and electric ceiling units mounted above the bar/patio for chilly days/nights . <sssss> the service for me has always been on point . <sssss> very quick , timely , polite , and never lacking when it comes to a drink refill or a suggestion -lrb- food or drinks -rrb- also great at informing specials . <sssss> monday nights they do $ 5 burgers , which are cooked to ones liking , i prefer mine med rare ... yummy . <sssss> beers are usually around 3-4 dollars depending , ca n't beat it . <sssss> cheaper on one of their many special nights . <sssss> weekends they do brunch and their brunch is amazing , i 've had a burrito here with a bloody and it was sooooo good , i walked home and took a nap . <sssss> damn thing put me to sleep . <sssss> sundays they have half off wine bottles and bottomless mimosas -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- from 11-2 . <sssss> basically if you are downtown , this is the place to stop in . <sssss> enjoy
?		i 've been here 3 times now , once was their opening night , and 2 other times since . <sssss> the pizza is simply amazing . <sssss> decor in side is great , service is awesome . <sssss> my favorite server is nick , he seems to be really cool and always remembers me when i come in . <sssss> he also gave me a rundown of the history of this place , it started off a food truck and still is by the way , but they decided to start of this more permanent location very recently . <sssss> this place is located directly south of the old spaghetti factory , maybe 300 yards south . <sssss> come in , have a drink , lounge and eat , it 's great !
?		i 've only been here for brunch once ... it 's the shit . <sssss> they had me with the `` attention ballers , no $ 50 or $ 100 bills , please '' -lrb- i 'll post a picture -rrb- basically my kind of place already . <sssss> it 's a tiny place inside thus the 4 stars but they have a nice patio area with benches , tables and ect . <sssss> food is like some concoction of amazingness . <sssss> i ca n't even remember what i had , but it was tasty and full of god knows what , pretty much everything and anything one can think of . <sssss> they also sell beers and stuff . <sssss> it 's located in the garfield district right off roosevelt . <sssss> i heard it was once a food truck that parked and now it rests . <sssss> go here for something awesome and different .
?		excellent service ! <sssss> this is one of my go to places to meet friends for happy hour . <sssss> i have to say they did not disappoint when i took my cousin for her birthday . <sssss> the bartender was great . <sssss> she made sure we knew there was less than 30 left for happy hour , then again 5 mins prior , she made sure we had our drinks and food order by 6pm . <sssss> great atmosphere and great service . <sssss> we really appreciate the extra attention .
?		wine , wine , wine ... cheers ! <sssss> i could n't wait to go here . <sssss> our 1st visit unfortunately was a saturday at 5ish so we just missed hh . <sssss> it was packed . <sssss> luck would have it we did get a seat at the bar -lrb- party of 4 -rrb- ... but , it took quite awhile before we got served . <sssss> so bar seating we were not impressed . <sssss> we put our name down for a table and the wait was over an hour . <sssss> we finally got our table 1.5 hrs later . <sssss> when we finally got our table and order our bottle of wine and food . <sssss> the food and wine was great ! <sssss> just getting to this point was aggravating ... plus we already spent 75 + bucks before we got seated . <sssss> i will go back , because i love , love , love the arcadia location . <sssss> i hope it was an off night . <sssss> food/wine = 5 stars service that night = 2.5 / 3starts
?		still ... really enjoy coming to sol . <sssss> yelpers - check in and sol givez you a check in offer . <sssss> salute ! <sssss> man , their margarita 's are so delicious their bartenders really listen to you if you request a special order . <sssss> the street tacos are still fabulous . <sssss> it 's too bad we live so far we ca n't frequent more ... but when we are in the area ... we make this a stop .
?		ok ... we came on a saturday afternoon from the scottsdale farmers market . <sssss> we drive by rnr after the market each saturday and decided to pop in . <sssss> i was excited to see they had a mimosa special that saturday afternoon . <sssss> the hostess was very nice asked where we wanted to be seated as the inside was pretty full but it was pretty chilly outside and she could not find us seating for 4 with a heater that was working . <sssss> the upstairs was closed but we did see people seating up there ... so we waited . <sssss> she was ready to seat us and a foursome decided it was too cold outside and they took our seat inside . <sssss> the hostess told us to wait , but we left . <sssss> i could n't wait to take my brother here as he is a chef in the cape cod area and read some of the yelps reviews so i thought this would be a great place to lunch after the farmers market . <sssss> anyhow , you do n't let customers leave you make it happen especially when you have all of upstairs open . <sssss> this place will never know how much we spend here on lunch for 4 or the review it could of been .
?		if you like hot waitresses , gold diggers , and cougars ... run to narcisse ! <sssss> if not , feel free to meander in when you 're out on the town in the north dale . <sssss> besides the interesting mix of barbies and douche bags , i think i would have liked the venue much more if i did n't go with a big group . <sssss> we had been put on the list in advance and supposedly had `` vip '' status . <sssss> the vip status basically means it takes you 30 minutes to get in the club because you have to wait for the bouncer to get you into the secret back entrance , then wait to get taken up the elevator , then wait in a secret teeny tiny room with a bunch of people for the host to come get you . <sssss> there was a lot of confusion with who was serving our group/table , so it made it less enjoyable . <sssss> the décor was sexy but presented with an upscale `` club '' vibe , and the layout was fairly open . <sssss> the two main downfalls to narcisse are they play dance music , but have no dance floor , and the only outdoor patio is the smoking section .
?		i really like the atmosphere of the vig uptown , i just wish i could say the same for the food . <sssss> it 's just not vegetarian friendly . <sssss> yes , they have a greasy vegetable sandwich , and yes , they can modify many menu items to be vegetarian , but a salad with no protein , is just not exciting . <sssss> it really frustrates me when restaurants say , `` well we can do this without the meat ... '' that may have been acceptable 15 years ago , but not when 10 % of the us population follow a vegetarian diet ! <sssss> we like to eat good food too ! <sssss> sorry for ranting , but for a new restaurant that portrays a hip/modern image , they are not living up to it . <sssss> i 've been to vig uptown several times because my bf likes it , but last night he said his potato pancake was not very good and the portion size of his carne continues to decrease every time he orders it . <sssss> i will say that the vig has great sangria , tasty specialty drinks , and i 've always had good service . <sssss> it 's hard to say i wo n't be back , because that 's probably not true ... i can say i will not be back for the food !
?		so this place was pretty neat . <sssss> we met my folks there for lunch on saturday . <sssss> i am a huge fan of le grande orange , so when they suggested it , i was pretty stoked to try it . <sssss> the restaurant itself has a modern yet organic feel . <sssss> the outside patio is just beautiful . <sssss> i would love to go there on a date with my hottie and have a glass of wine by the fire place ! <sssss> but i 'll wait until fall = -rrb- . <sssss> about the food , it was very good , no complaints . <sssss> i had a homemade veggie burger and fries with gruyere cheese . <sssss> the boys both ordered burgers and devoured them , so i assume they were good . <sssss> my mom had the short rib tacos and she raved about them , the server said that was there specialty and her favorite . <sssss> she also tried their white sangria which was pretty tasty too . <sssss> for dessert we had a chocolate flourless cake served with pistachio gelato and whip cream ... um , can i say ... yum !
?		with a `` moo-moo '' here and a `` moo-moo '' there ... everywhere a `` moo-moo '' ! <sssss> sorry that was the first thing that came to mind when i was asked to go to the farm for lunch . <sssss> as first timers , we were a little confused on where we suppose to start , but there was a long line of people , with no food , holding menu 's ... so we started there . <sssss> as a vegetarian i was pleasantly surprised with the variety in their menu . <sssss> in fact i changed my mind five times before we got up to order . <sssss> i ended up with a 1/2 farm fresh veggie sandwich , a cup of bean soup and finished up with butternut squash creme brulee . <sssss> the food was excellent , in fact i had to restrain from licking my soup bowl clean . <sssss> the only downside is it took forever to come out , and to top it off , i had to get a redo on my sandwich because they smothered it in mayo -lrb- which i do not eat , ever ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> despite the semi-chaotic service and delivery , it 's hard to complain about getting a great meal , and enjoying in such a beautiful setting . <sssss> the tables are set up along side the farm , and surrounded by huge trees . <sssss> i am really looking forward to coming back and giving their breakfast a shot !
?		i 've wanted to try this place for a while , so i finally talked my boyfriend into going before a movie . <sssss> he was reluctant because he had been to another location and felt it was just `` so , so '' . <sssss> well he was right . <sssss> when we walked in the host and hostess seemed confused , as to what we might be doing there ... um we would like a table , please ! <sssss> so they looked at the computer and at each other and decided to sit us at a two top table which shared a bench with a family with young kids , meanwhile the restaurant was about 80 % empty . <sssss> the service was okay , but we had to wait about 20 minutes for our check which was a little annoying . <sssss> we would have gladly ordered another beer while we were waiting for it , but we were never asked . <sssss> as for the food , the chips and salsa were decent and my veggie enchiladas were good . <sssss> i do n't really have anything to complain about , it just did n't blow me away in one direction or another . <sssss> if i could give it a 2.5 i would .
?		let me start by saying , as a vegetarian flemings is not the most exciting dining selection , but i decided to give it a try for the sake of my bf and he 's carnivorous appetite . <sssss> as good guests do , we called ahead and made reservations . <sssss> when we arrived the hostess did not greet us , we had to let her know we were there and who we were , as she was too busy burying her face into the computer screen . <sssss> never looking up at us , she looked at the screen for a bit , waited for another hostess to walk up and then handed her our menus and table location . <sssss> it was the oddest thing , she never made eye contact nor did she wish a pleasant dining experience . <sssss> we both walked away thinking wtf ? <sssss> after the initial awkwardness from the hostess , we were sat by a pleasant hostess and greeted by our server . <sssss> the service overall was very attentive , but that was about as good as it got . <sssss> our server had very little knowledge of the menu , wine list or what items on the menu were vegetarian . <sssss> a previous reviewer had mentioned a fantastic vegetarian platter offered to them that was not on the . <sssss> she knew of no such thing , nor did she offer to check with the chef . <sssss> she just recommended i get a double order of the mushroom ravioli appetizer , or a bunch of side dishes . <sssss> boo ! <sssss> i started with one of their specialty drinks , a combination of prosecco and elder flower liquor , it was very tasty ! <sssss> i ordered a caesar salad with ranch on the side to start , it of course came out with the ranch tossed into the salad . <sssss> for dinner i ordered the double order of ravioli , bf ordered their large filet , and we shared a side of mushrooms and their flemings potatoes . <sssss> overall my ravioli were very tasty but i could tell the sauce was pretty much just melted butter ... so how can you go wrong ! <sssss> my bf 's steak came out at a solid medium , not the medium rare he requested . <sssss> in addition , it had this weird separation of the meat by some sort of tendon or fat that i have never seen in a filet . <sssss> for a steakhouse that was very disappointing . <sssss> overall , the meal was okay and the service was okay . <sssss> if it was a $ 100 meal i would have given it a 3 stars , but for $ 200 i expect a lot more in terms of service . <sssss> sorry flemings , we will not be back .
?		i always have good time at this place . <sssss> i could write a page about geisha , but the previous reviews pretty much sum this place up . <sssss> * self servicing bathrooms -lrb- ladies only -rrb- * fantastic happy hour pricing - the veggie pot stickers are the bomb ! <sssss> * hot waitresses ... barely of age to serve you alcohol = -rrb- * private karaoke rooms that allow you to humiliate yourself in front of your friends only the only thing i would steer clear of is the specialty drinks they are overly sweet and are not made with fresh fruit ... even when they say they are . <sssss> the waitress cleared that up for me last weekend = -rrb- .
?		i hate to break it to you all ... but the long awaiting delivery of an h & m store in scottsdale , turned out to be a huge disappointment ! <sssss> ever hear the saying `` good from far , but far from good '' ? <sssss> this pretty much sums it up . <sssss> the clothes are great for a straight figured person with no curves that only wants to wear their cloths once or twice . <sssss> otherwise you are sol ! <sssss> there is no quality control whatsoever , except that they are all made cheaply ! <sssss> the only thing good i can say about h & m is the have cute accessories .
?		i tried rnr again , not by choice , by default for a group event . <sssss> we showed up for hh a little before 6 . <sssss> we had a party of 8-10 and were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait . <sssss> so we grabbed a drink at the bar . <sssss> the host was a little scatter brained . <sssss> when i checked our status about 25 minutes later , he said `` oops , i thought i sat you '' he had crossed my name off the list . <sssss> really ? <sssss> was there another party of 10 in the restaraunt ... no ! <sssss> we noticed that he went missing for a while a two large both opened up , back to back . <sssss> the server was annoyed that they were sitting empty for so long , so she asked if wanted to sit there ... at this point it was about 6:40 , so we took her up on it . <sssss> she was great , i thought it was going to be a repeat of my last experience with terrible service , but she did make up for it . <sssss> i guess all i can say about rnr is if you 're going there for hh , get there early and plan on waiting . <sssss> it 's a neat place but if they do n't take care of their service issues they will go under . <sssss> this is scottsdale , there will be another trendy spot , and their legecy will die .
?		it 's hard to not give a place a 4 , when they have decent wine priced at $ 4/glass ! <sssss> it 's not the best thai food i 've ever had , but i definitely enjoyed it ! <sssss> we started off with the egg rolls , which were good , and then i had the pumpkin curry with tofu for dinner , which was excellent ! <sssss> it was a bit spicy , but i was able to cool my mouth off with some yummy pineapple/coconut ice cream afterwards , so not to worry = -rrb- . <sssss> lao is definitely worth a try , just make sure you emphasize mild if you are going to try the red curry , because it was kickin !
?		i had to seriously debate on whether i should drop my review down to a 2 , but i am going to give p & p a little lead way for still being new . <sssss> mainly because i really want them to succeed , since they are just around the corner from our house . <sssss> here are the 3 main reasons they have lost my love . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> the removed my favorite dish and the only vegetarian starter on the menu 2 . <sssss> their website and twitter handle both say happy hour until 7pm , but they decided to change it to 6 and will not honor what they 've advertised . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> their pickles are disgusting we still received great service , and my vegetarian chile/mash was pretty tasty , but i hate going to a restaurant where i do n't have choices or the opportunity to experience a complete meal -lrb- starter , main course , and dessert -rrb- . <sssss> the server mentioned that their menu keeps changing and it 's hard for her to keep up , let alone the website ... this is going to cause them major problems if they do n't get their act together . <sssss> i was disspointed and live a mile away , imagine how upset someone will be who traveled a great distance based on the information they had listed on their website ! <sssss> again , i hope they do well , but i wo n't be rushing back any time soon ...
?		not much to say here , but if you have n't tried oregano 's yet ... stop what you 're doing and go now ! <sssss> they have a huge menu with tons of tasty stuff to choose from . <sssss> we almost always split a large whole wheat thin crust pizza and have a couple tall sunshine wheat beers ; it 's a little greasy and full of calories , but its comfort food at its best . <sssss> i have also tried their pastas , veggie sandwich and fried ravioli 's too , and was equally as pleased . <sssss> the menu is very inexpensive for the portion sizes , and the service is always good . <sssss> i would recommend either getting there early or plan on waiting for a while , because it is always packed .
?		meh ! <sssss> = i totally neutral is how i left kitchen 56 . <sssss> we arrived with reservations and were promptly sat at a high top table in the middle of the restaurant . <sssss> i was surprised to see it was pretty busy for 8pm on a friday . <sssss> our server greeted us very briefly and took hottie 's drink order -lrb- i wanted to look over the menu -rrb- and then left . <sssss> he seemed pretty frazzled . <sssss> about 5 minutes later our drinks were dropped off by someone else , who did not ask if we needed anything . <sssss> another 5 minutes pass and a female server comes to our table and asks if we are ready to order . <sssss> no , `` hi my name is '' ... `` let me tell you about the menu '' , nothing ! <sssss> i told her i would like to order a drink and she seemed annoyed , like i was being rude . <sssss> she took my drink order and our appetizer order and left . <sssss> we started with the onion straws , a little greasy but overall pretty tasty especially because the sauce was fantastic . <sssss> for my cocktail i had a maple manhattan , which was so delicious one of the best manhattan 's i 've had . <sssss> for dinner i ordered their tofu and vegetable stir fry with soba noodles . <sssss> this had received good reviews from fellow yelpers so i was excited to try it . <sssss> i was greatly disappointed . <sssss> the noodles were over cooked , it had no flavor except ginger and there were no vegetables in it except red cabbage . <sssss> i never send anything back , but i did . <sssss> this of course took about 10 minutes , because our server never came back to check on us . <sssss> i flagged down a manager and she suggested the green chili macaroni . <sssss> by the time this came out , hottie had already finished his meal and his plate had been taken . <sssss> this kind of kills the dining experience . <sssss> when the macaroni came out , it was much better , great flavor and just the right amount of creaminess and spice . <sssss> again the noodles were a little over cooked ; they were breaking apart , but still edible . <sssss> overall , the service was pretty poor , but being a former server i could tell that they were all `` in the weeds '' so i gave her a break , and still left a 30 % tip . <sssss> the food was good , but not great . <sssss> i think i would try kitchen 56 again under the right circumstances , but with so many other options in the area , it wo n't be anytime soon .
?		bourbon steak is an excellent restaurant . <sssss> yes it 's on expensive but that 's to be expected . <sssss> the only thing i had a problem with was the service 2 out of the 4 times i have been there . <sssss> they need to have better management in my opinion . <sssss> they have many unique foods and appetizers . <sssss> just give them a try and i 'm sure you will not be disappointed . <sssss> at least with the food . <sssss> lol . <sssss> .
?		a decent place to watch the game and other sports . <sssss> the service is not the best there but you are not going there for the best service . <sssss> this is what i call a breastrant . <sssss> the food is pretty good nice portions for the price . <sssss> the staff is friendly n gorgeous as they should be .
?		this is a great neighborhood spot for some traditional sonoran mexican food . <sssss> i usually get the blackened chicken or shrimp burrito and it is always very consistent and good . <sssss> they make all their own salsas and they are very good . <sssss> the habanero sauce is their hottest and it has a good kick but nothing crazy hot . <sssss> good place and a good price .
?		good food at a decent price . <sssss> only problem when i come here is it seems i am the only customer so not much on ambiance or social scene .
?		it is a nice large airport with many amenities while waiting for your flight or to pick someone up
?		classic scottsdale dive bar . <sssss> this place has been here for 30 plus years and is a great spot in downtown scottsdale . <sssss> very chill and very inexpensive for all drinks .
?		i have only been to black bear diner for the breakfast and the food is fantastic ! <sssss> lots of great tasting food for a low price !
?		finally went to postinos after many people telling me how good it is . <sssss> i went in with high exceptions and i was let down . <sssss> our food was overpriced and honestly not that good . <sssss> we ate on the patio and the misters were leaking on us , my friends pants where completely soaked , the service was ok but nothing special . <sssss> there is really nothing for me at postinos , hope your experience is better
?		nando 's is great ! <sssss> to start off their chips and salsa are great . <sssss> not only are they free but they are not stingy with them they will keep bringing them out till you say no more . <sssss> everything is good on their menu , but my personal favorite is their pizza blanco . <sssss> it is a mexican pizza with cream cheese , chicken , tomato 's , chiles , onions and cheese . <sssss> you wont be disappointed at all . <sssss> carful if you get the pizza blanco you will want to order that every time you go , you will have no other choice but to order it , it is that good !
?		best kept secret for breakfast in old town . <sssss> i ordered the open faced breakfast sandwich and was so happy ! <sssss> it comes on a creamy texas toast base with your choice of prepared egg , bacon and a side of hash browns . <sssss> i went over-easy on the egg and my mouth is watering just thinking about this breakfast . <sssss> it was so good ! <sssss> the plus here is adding a bloody mary was only $ 1.99 with breakfast . <sssss> me and my girls got a round ! <sssss> why not ?
?		nothing special but good for watching a game outside and grabbing a beer with buddies . <sssss> the people watching has never been that good here . <sssss> in fact , it 's more of a boring vibe . <sssss> the food is n't bad .
?		great spot in downtown phoenix . <sssss> our day drinking party got loud by this stop -lrb- # 5 -rrb- on the lightrail adventure . <sssss> our party did n't try any food but we did find a great mix of people in here and some nice stiff drinks . <sssss> did we need those at this point , probably not !
?		i can not believe that i have n't reviewed stacy 's yet . <sssss> this place is amazing . <sssss> you will be convinced as soon as you step out of the car and smell the smoking meat filling the parking lot with a salivating aroma . <sssss> it is small , sparse decor , skimpy tables and chairs , but the food makes up for it . <sssss> the fried chicken , made fresh when you order so it takes a while , is probably the best that i have ever had . <sssss> the bbq sandwiches are awesome , too . <sssss> the fried okra and fried pickles are fantastic . <sssss> the menu is extensive , bbq sandwiches , bbq ribs , chicken , beef , pork , fried catfish and fried chicken . <sssss> there are a ton of sides , okra , beans , collard greens , mashed potatoes , fried pickles and more . <sssss> it is way too hard to order just a couple . <sssss> and you can wash it all down with some sweet tea , or kool-aid or an orange crush in a bottle . <sssss> if you are still hungry , you can have some red velvet cake or another homemade dessert . <sssss> for some bad ass southern comfort food , it does n't get any better than this . <sssss> forget about all the other bbq places . <sssss> stacy 's is the only one you need to know . <sssss> and bring cash , no debit or credit cards are accepted .
?		this place has amazing food , separate menus for lunch and dinner and a full bar . <sssss> there is dining inside or on the patio . <sssss> i think the entire staff is italian and you can usually hear conversations in italian between the staff and customers , adding to the ambiance and authenticity . <sssss> the northern italian cuisine is truly amazing , the staff is always warm and friendly . <sssss> the meals start out with a few kinds of bread and dipping sauces and vinegar and oil . <sssss> i could go just for that . <sssss> there are plenty choices for vegetarians and carnivores alike . <sssss> menu : http://www.venetotrattoria.com/menu1.html i highly recommend it !
?		i had high expectations for la condesa , but it quickly turned to la confusión . <sssss> the three of us went in during the week for a late lunch , salivating at the thought of some tasty tacos . <sssss> we each ordered a different taco combo plate , one aztec tinga , one oaxaca black mole chicken , one baja sur dogfish shark , and a quesadilla . <sssss> after waiting a significant amount of time , the waitress brought out our quesadilla and one combo plate with one aztec tinga taco and one oaxaca black mole chicken taco . <sssss> despite going over our order numerous times with our server and another gentlemen , somehow , what we wanted seemed beyond comprehension . <sssss> they brought out the baja sur dogfish shark taco combo plate and , after waiting so long and confusion over our order , we gave up and ate what we had . <sssss> the azteca tinga was superb . <sssss> the oaxaca black mole was good . <sssss> the baja sur dogfish was n't really any better than your average fish taco . <sssss> the rice is a white rice that had decent flavor and the same can be said for the flavor of the refried beans . <sssss> la condesa has a great salsa bar , a cozy interior decorated with some great día de los muertos art . <sssss> the staff was nice and friendly , despite the fact our order remained so elusive . <sssss> but , after the ordeal with our order and the less than stellar meal , i have to say that la condesa was an utter disappointment .
?		after hearing nothing but rave reviews of america 's taco shop , it was time to give it a try . <sssss> i ordered their `` best carne asada in town '' tacos . <sssss> and i beg to differ . <sssss> there are plenty of places i have had better carne asada . <sssss> i 'm going to blaspheme according to some , but i 've had better carne asada at chipotle , for meat 's sake . <sssss> i thought the meat was overcooked . <sssss> i have yet to find somewhere that comes close to comedor guadalajara for carne asada . <sssss> the side of beans was ok . <sssss> the staff was courteous and friendly , the service was great . <sssss> but , i really do n't see what the big deal is about america 's taco shop . <sssss> after all the hype , i expected it to be great . <sssss> but it was good , at best . <sssss> with a menu as limited as america 's taco shop has , they should excel at what little they do offer and that 's just not the case .
?		a great little place to see shows , very small , very intimate , a great setting for seeing a band . <sssss> if a band you want to see is playing here , be sure to go , it does n't get anymore up close and personal than this . <sssss> there is no seating or alcohol , so if you do n't mind standing and being sober , it is well worth it . <sssss> the art here is some of first friday 's best , as far as i am concerned , leagues above all the other galleries . <sssss> be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then .
?		this is one of the best indian restaurants i have been to in the valley . <sssss> it has great reviews from critics and some famous clientle that frequent the restaurant . <sssss> the location is great for an artsy-evening since it is right by the performing arts center and the modern art museum . <sssss> it is quiet and intimate , a great menu and food . <sssss> each experience has been wonderful , both the food and the service .
?		every times i went to cherry blossom , i always had rice or pasta plates . <sssss> then last weekend , i went there again for noodle soup . <sssss> now i can say that all the menus there are delicious . <sssss> the atmosphere is cozy and the staff are so friendly . <sssss> beware of the leg on the front door during the haloween ... heeheehee ...
?		this is our neighborhood restaurant . <sssss> whenever i want margarita sunrise and desserts , i went to switch . <sssss> i never disappoint .
?		i really love this new location . <sssss> it look cute and feel like i got lose into france . <sssss> my favorite are chocolate croissant and black forest cake .
?		the best crepe in town !!! <sssss> even though the sign on the door does not make sense but i still gave 5 stars . <sssss> the sign told us to get to the door to get the table . <sssss> we were in front of the door and noone help us . <sssss> until we figured out that we had to actually go through the door to get inside to get the table .
?		if you 're looking for fresh seafood , great ambiance , & exceptional service you need to check out mastro 's ocean club . <sssss> their seafood is flown in fresh daily . <sssss> if you order a martini , you not only get a full martini glass , but a half full shaker as well . <sssss> even the bread basket is delicious ! <sssss> -lrb- i have a soft spot for the pretzel bread -rrb- . <sssss> the halibut is delicious , but the vanilla battered lobster tail is my absolute favorite . <sssss> like flavorful mashed potatoes ? <sssss> order the mastro 's mashed potatoes ! <sssss> the sweet potato steak fries are delicious as well . <sssss> looking for a great steak instead ? <sssss> no worries . <sssss> they serve the same great steaks that they serve at mastro 's steakhouse & city hall steakhouse !
?		i have been to this place at least a half a dozen times & i absolutely love it ! <sssss> it does n't look like much from the outside , but as soon as you walk in you are pleasantly surprised with their outside patio and water features ! <sssss> they have an excellent happy hour as well . <sssss> i was brave and tried the habanero cheeseburger one night & it was fierce ! <sssss> it was delicious going down , but i regretted it the next day ! <sssss> haha ... i also love the cavern chicken salad & the lobster enchiladas ! <sssss> yum yum !
?		this is definitely one of the nicest sports bars i 've ever been to before . <sssss> they have a great patio , the best sangria i think i 've ever tasted , and the taco pizza is to die for ! <sssss> the service was good , and i only have one complaint ... the parking ! <sssss> i think it is absolutely ridiculous to offer valet parking in such a small lot with very limited parking . <sssss> i hate when places do that ! <sssss> i will be back ! <sssss> : - -rrb-
?		kabuki wont deliver cutting edge delights like that basement gem in boston or seattle , so dont get your hopes up . <sssss> but if you 're like me , thrilled to dip a few standard rolls in too much soy without getting sick in the shadow of the stadium , kabuki 's a kickass spot for the family to enjoy that second rate sushi experience . <sssss> we 've had two decent meals here . <sssss> one in a hurry before a game and the second a more leisurely affair out on their porch overlooking the outdoor mall . <sssss> both servers were young and tentative , but polite and pleasant and accomodated our plans well each time . <sssss> the sushi is very ordinary . <sssss> tempura 's better . <sssss> on a generic quality/price scale , it 's too expensive , but you 're also paying for a special location , steps from the stadium and parking . <sssss> the premium they charge for that , compared to other pregame alternatives , seems like a very fair exchange .
?		the food 's good , but you know that . <sssss> the atmosphere 's notable too . <sssss> part of it is the young , hip servers who arent always the most efficient but who are always friendly and fun to look at . <sssss> part of it is the location , offset a few blocks from central . <sssss> you can enjoy the big buildings , but you 're not quite in the middle of it , logistically or spiritually . <sssss> this feels like an out of the way throwback for a tryst or a rendevous . <sssss> . <sssss> part of it is the property itself and retro design . <sssss> the narrow front desk and foyer opening up into the bar and colorful restaurant to the right , and a snug courtyard pool towards the back . <sssss> it feels like a pocket vegas lodge from the fifties before everything there went on steroids . <sssss> perhaps the biggest part of the atmosphere , though , is the late don bolles . <sssss> this is where the reporter was murdered , in 1976 , and where phoenix arguably began its evolution from a mob run backwater into a modern major american city . <sssss> every time i park my fusion in that little lot , i wonder . <sssss> is this the spot ? <sssss> it 's an important political and historical event in arizona . <sssss> we cant be sure who ordered the hit , but it 's clear bolles was a victim of domestic terrorism . <sssss> when you enter the hotel , there 's a bust of the intrepid reporter on your left . <sssss> enjoy your meal . <sssss> ***** food : 5 stars dessert , drinks : 3.5 service : 3.5 atmosphere : 5
?		three keys for adults to enjoy this particular zoo . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> arrive as early as possible - it 's cooler , less crowded and the animals are more active . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> buy a membership - members may enter an hour prior to opening , when it 's more ` cooler ' , more ` less crowded ' and animals are more ` more active ' . <sssss> the $ 45 package incl two guest admissions , complimentary zoolights tix and a couple ride freebies in addtn to unlimited zoo admission . <sssss> now i pop in for a jog or power walk at 7 or 8am , once a month or so , and feel like i really get my money 's worth . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> it helps if you like to quietly observe animals . <sssss> sounds obvious , but there 's no seaworldesque shows or truly iconic draws banging you over the head here , like shamu , polar bears or giant pandas . <sssss> but there is a blase anteater coexisting with a red wolf . <sssss> a gymnastic young orangutan . <sssss> playful otters and all the cool cats . <sssss> baboons . <sssss> javalina and a 700 lb tortoise . <sssss> bighorn sheep loping impossibly along slippery buttes . <sssss> zebras that look like paintings , posing with giant maribou storks . <sssss> plenty to see , if animals interest you . <sssss> arrive early , avoid summer .
?		houston 's esplanade always did more things right than not , but it had also been declining , almost imperceptibly , since the nineties . <sssss> pricing consistently outstripped inflation , the kitchen 's impressive attention to detail began to slip on a couple entrees , and for some time , they ceased reciting prices on heavily marked up and misleadingly touted `` specials '' . <sssss> our first visit to hillstone represented an acceleration of that decline . <sssss> the stone and glass prairie style building 's very attractive inside and out , but i couldnt find the front door . <sssss> neither could a bunch of other drivers , circling the property . <sssss> maybe the architect feels this adds to one 's sense of discovery , but i found sardining my way through an overcrowded megabar at the wrong end of the building , in order to locate the restaurant checkstand , to be an unwelcome pain in the ass . <sssss> our table split an attractively plated $ 17 sushi sampler that was tasty , but we never got plates . <sssss> the food 's always been quality and still is , but a vinagrette on the steak and noodle salad wasmore acidic than before , and a fish entree was described as `` a little overcooked '' . <sssss> other entrees were excellent , as before . <sssss> a small quality step down from across the street . <sssss> our server oozed a scripted , contemptuous charm , designed to inflate the bill and tip with every breath , yet provided less tangible service than i normally get in an ihop . <sssss> houston 's staff , at times , could be stiff and occasionally obsequious - but never this agressively insincere or useless . <sssss> my water glass was empty almost half the evening . <sssss> we asked for a bottle that eventually arrived , so we could serve ourselves . <sssss> that ran out too , and sat for ages . <sssss> we intended to split a dessert , but the waiter pushed so hard the whole table felt condescended to and we opted to skip it . <sssss> to my astonishment , not once during the meal were we solicited as to how our food was or if we required anything . <sssss> at least not while we were eating , when it might 've mattered . <sssss> that changed as soon as my wife lingered over coffee , in lieu of dessert , which prompted our starched white shirt to `` inquire '' if she didnt like it - evidently because her cup didnt empty fast enough to turn his next table . <sssss> it was that kind of evening . <sssss> overpriced -lrb- everything 's gone up a buck or two -rrb- . <sssss> shitty , ingratiating service masquerading as fine dining . <sssss> there are more suits now , managing -lrb- something other than service , evidently -rrb- by walking around . <sssss> booths are smaller , so that a quarter of my upscale table space now belongs to a condiment caddy . <sssss> the old dining room hummed with a muffled energy ; this one 's just loud , like a diner or suns game . <sssss> we frequented houston 's since it opened in 1988 . <sssss> hundreds of times . <sssss> but we felt uncomfortable and , frankly , kinda played here . <sssss> we 'll give it another chance this summer . <sssss> houston 's was too good not to . <sssss> but if anyone from hillstone is reading this , let me share the best part of our evening . <sssss> it was in the crowded foyer , waiting for a table - something i 'm normally impatient with anyway - moreso because my 79 year old mom had no place to sit . <sssss> -lrb- it was a cold , new years eve night and everyone was cramped inside -rrb- . <sssss> but you 've got that wonderful , busy kitchen counter right there , and my wife struck up a little conversation with one of your hard working grill men . <sssss> we recognized him from across the street and exchanged wishes for a happy new year . <sssss> that was the only genuine , pleasant interaction we had with your overly groomed staff all night .
?		just one lunch visit to this oddly angled and hard to find storefront , and i 'm convinced bertha 's value and attention to detail exceeds that found at more heralded , pricier luncheonettes . <sssss> fresh squeezed lemonade is just that . <sssss> the best potato salad -lrb- $ 1.95 -rrb- i 've encountered ; precisely softened baby reds dusted in dill and not too much mayo . <sssss> hefty , succulent curry chicken wrap -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- , perfectly balanced and assembled , accompanied by a fresh chocolate nut cookie . <sssss> $ 4 turkey chili , which was either 16 or 20 oz , and comes with nice brioche toast . <sssss> it 's absurd to think my mom and me conveniently lunched here for less than $ 20 , and brought home food , whereas later that evening , after waiting half an hour for a table , my wife and i spent more than twice that at chelsea 's , for a decidedly inferior meal .
?		bumped into john shadegg here friday night , but this is still a reputable restaurant . <sssss> the southwest cuisine has some zip and is broadly well executed . <sssss> table service is efficient , but can be cool . <sssss> dinner entrees and specials lean pricey , so i usually go for a green chile burger with a side of azteca soup . <sssss> conventional , but both elements are sizable , delicious and a relative steal at $ 11 . <sssss> the burger is a half pound of chuck , well dressed with a spongy roll . <sssss> the soup is a spicy chicken tortilla variation with some subtle hints . <sssss> it 's a satisfying plate for about the cost of my wife 's 4 oz glass of vino . <sssss> if they had interesting beer on draught , like a really nice ipa , and more charming servers , this might be five star territory . <sssss> p.s. - sunday brunch is not a buffet , but the menu 's inventive , elegant and delicious . <sssss> recommended .
?		food was tasty & location / outdoor seating is wonderful .
?		great spot for happy hours
?		good buffet
?		ah ... binkley 's . <sssss> what can i say . <sssss> as a chef , i 'm was almost required to eat here , due to the fact that this place takes my craft to the next level . <sssss> i had the chef 's tasting menu . <sssss> it was 5 courses on paper , but with all of the little freebies and treats thrown in between courses , i think i had 12 or so . <sssss> the creativity of the food is borderline genius , yet at same time not over thought . <sssss> it had elements of `` aww . <sssss> . <sssss> how cute '' and elements of `` holy dog fuck , this is good ! '' <sssss> . <sssss> i enjoyed my dinner with the wine tasting service that complimented each course . <sssss> i will say though . <sssss> some of their wine offerings were a bit mundane and talked up a little too much by the sommelier . <sssss> serving a port i can get at fry 's for $ 11 a bottle with my dessert is n't something to boast about . <sssss> ca n't bullshit a bullshitter , but luckily i was in a festive mood and felt like being treated like a guest so i kept my mouth shut , this is the kinda place to soak in all of the stimulation . <sssss> your eyes , nose , tongue and brain will be stroked . <sssss> service was tight , and it better be for the amount of money being dropped . <sssss> chef binkley is almost always on the line , watching every plate go out his kitchen window . <sssss> the menu changes quite regularly with seasonal food being the focus . <sssss> i 'd recommend this place as a special occasion spot . <sssss> save up your pennies and venture out to cave creek .
?		i just moved to the ` hood and i 've been here a few times . <sssss> the beer is cold , the food is hot and the service is warm and friendly . <sssss> they have the standard english/irish beer selection , guiness , smithwicks , newcastle , etc. . <sssss> the food is standard pub fare , burgers , sandwiches , salads , etc. . <sssss> the fish chips are pretty good . <sssss> large filet of fish , beer battered to a crispy finish . <sssss> served with hot french fries , ramekin of slaw and some lemon wedges . <sssss> -lrb- do n't forget the malt vinegar !!! <sssss> -rrb- beers are $ 5 a pint , a touch pricey , but i 'm down for supported local establishments . <sssss> the servers are always warm and friendly .
?		this place was my regular lunch spot for years . <sssss> once because i moved further away did i forget about it , but now that i 'm closer , it 's making it back into the rotation of places to eat . <sssss> post peak hours , there is almost always ample seating . <sssss> it 's traditionally seat yourself during non-lunch hours , and the place is small enough where the server staff finds you quickly . <sssss> , they offer two types of iced teas , regular and passion fruit , served in large tumblers . <sssss> i always get started with the greek fries . <sssss> they are smothered in melted feta , lemon juice , and oregano , it 's a good sized portion for the price . <sssss> then i always get a gyro pita . <sssss> i have never deviated past that . <sssss> but it 's consistent service and good food .
?		as a self proclaimed beer aficionado , this place has pretty good selection of bottle beers , ranging from microbrews from the states and more harder to get european beers . <sssss> their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place . <sssss> as far as the bar offerings , the menu is simple , but pretty solid for bar food . <sssss> pizzas are good , sandwiches are good . <sssss> make your own 6-pack for $ 8.99 is a pretty good deal if you pick standard 12oz bottles of `` non-speciality '' beers . <sssss> but my expensive tastes cost me $ 22 for a 6 pack ...
?		i 've actually never heard of this place since i live in the east valley so it is quite far for me . <sssss> however , my friends were raving about it and wanted to come here for dinner last night and i 'm always up for trying new places . <sssss> = -rrb- i actually really liked the ambiance of the restaurant . <sssss> it has a cozy , mom and pop shop feel to it . <sssss> as far as the menu , there are so many things to choose from ! <sssss> they have such a variety of things on the menu that it was so hard to know what to get . <sssss> plus i was starving so i wanted to try everything ! <sssss> you can have some italian pasta , ramen noodles , sushi , cold noodles , hot noodles , thai noodles or a rice dish . <sssss> it was such a huge selection to choose from . <sssss> i 'm glad i came with my friends because i was so indecisive on what to order . <sssss> i ended up getting the chicken pad thai with a milk green tea to wash it down . <sssss> i 've never really enjoyed a green tea but when i saw it on the menu it was something different so i wanted to try it . <sssss> it was actually quite tasty . <sssss> they also have a variety of wines and cocktails to choose from . <sssss> the chicken pad thai itself was ok . <sssss> i thought it was a bit salty and was n't anything spectacular . <sssss> all in all , i do n't think it 's a restaurant that i would drive across town to . <sssss> if i was in the area then it would most likely be an option to choose from , mainly because i also want to try their sushi and ramen noodles . <sssss> but they are well known for their noodles so i 'd like to come back to try that next time . <sssss> = -rrb-
?		you ca n't go to a taco place and not try the tacos right !? <sssss> my friend told me about this place and wanted to try it out . <sssss> when you first sit down you get complementary chips and salsa . <sssss> it was nothing special . <sssss> it was a bit spicy for my taste . <sssss> i ordered the carne asada tacos and the crispy fish taco . <sssss> i was n't too fond of the carne asada tacos . <sssss> it was a bit dry and bland and i felt like it needed sauce or sour cream or something with it . <sssss> the crispy fish tacos were really good though . <sssss> beer battered fish and guacamole got me ! <sssss> lol . <sssss> i washed everything down with the strawberry agua fresca . <sssss> it was delicious ! <sssss> it has vodka , gin and rum in it . <sssss> i 'd like to try their `` spiked '' horchata next time i come . <sssss> for dessert we ordered the churros con chocolate which was quite yummy . <sssss> = -rrb- the customer service was really good . <sssss> we were always taken care of and the staff is very knowledgeable of their menu . <sssss> the only negative for me was there was no sign on the restaurant ! <sssss> i drove up and down the street for like 15 minutes and i could n't find it . <sssss> i had to call my friend to find out where it was . <sssss> the only sign they have is on the door . <sssss> which is definitely not noticeable at night time . <sssss> i know they are a new establishment but i felt like a huge sign should 've been the first thing to take care of . <sssss> i never would 've found it at all . <sssss> all in all , i really liked their drinks and will probably come back during happy hour to try the rest of their drink menu . <sssss> = -rrb-
?		love love love sushi ! <sssss> i 've actually been going to this place for a few years now and i love it . <sssss> there are two things that i absolutely love about it . <sssss> it 's incredibly inexpensive and the sushi comes on a conveyer belt ! <sssss> what more can you ask for . <sssss> =p i think that the sushi itself is quite tasty for the price you pay . <sssss> each plate is between $ 1 to $ 3 . <sssss> not to mention they have such a variety of sushi to choose from . <sssss> not only is the sushi cheap but even the drinks are reasonably priced ! <sssss> you can get a beer or glass of wine for $ 4 . <sssss> i usually have to come here at least once a month to get my teharu fix in for the month because i seriously love this place . <sssss> i 'm little so i 'm usually full after maybe $ 3 or $ 4 worth of sushi . <sssss> lol . <sssss> my favorite roll there is the baked scallop roll . <sssss> it 's basically a california roll with baked scallop on top and it comes out nice and warm for you . <sssss> = -rrb- the staff is also very friendly and helpful . <sssss> they 're very good at bringing you what you need quickly , no doubt about it . <sssss> i think one of the downfalls is if you come in the evening or on the weekends there is a pretty long wait to get seated . <sssss> also , if you come during the day or when it is less busy they do n't have a big variety of a sushi selection like they would when it was busy . <sssss> but do n't worry , because it is definitely worth the wait . <sssss> = -rrb-
?		let me start by saying i absolutely love happy hours ! <sssss> what 's not to love , everything 's half off and it 's happy hour ! <sssss> = -rrb- their reverse happy hour is from 9-close and my friend and i have been going here for probably about a year now for their happy hour . <sssss> we usually come here maybe once every couple weeks and we are never disappointed . <sssss> for their drinks , i usually get their house margaritas for happy hour . <sssss> it 's better frozen but i like my margaritas on the rocks . <sssss> or sometimes i get a glass of their house wine since i 've been an obsessed wine drinker . <sssss> =p their margaritas are $ 1 off & their wines are $ 2 off . <sssss> as far as their happy hour food , they have a pretty big selection of items for happy hour actually . <sssss> i 've tried almost everything on their happy hour menu and love everything . <sssss> however , my favorite is their street tacos . <sssss> it comes with a side of their special avocado salsa verde sauce . <sssss> i 'm not sure what 's in it , but it 's amazing ! <sssss> my friend and i will usually get like 3 sides of it ! <sssss> lol . <sssss> whatever i order there i always have to get a side of this special sauce because it 's so dam delicious . <sssss> = -rrb- their customer service is actually really good . <sssss> their staff is really friendly and helpful and have a lot of knowledge about the menu . <sssss> the only reason i did n't give it a 5 star is because i 've never tried their dinner menu so i ca n't really review it . <sssss> other than that , i really do enjoy their happy hour and it 's actually become one of my favorite happy hour spots . <sssss> = -rrb-
?		i want to preface this to say it sickens me to give this place a 2 star rating . <sssss> i 've been going to `` that 's a wrap '' for years . <sssss> back when they were on 7th street and then with the move to camelback . <sssss> i have always loved the food . <sssss> it 's been a craving at times . <sssss> there were times i used to stop off just before they closed and i would visit with the then owner while waiting for my dinner on my way home from work . <sssss> i would race out of work just to make it in time . <sssss> lately , and this seems since it has moved to the camelback location , the food is still very good , however the size of the wraps have drastically decreased . <sssss> last week , i grabbed a wrap to-go and when i got it hope i was like wtf ? <sssss> i have noticed this decrease slowly happening over time but last week was the limit . <sssss> i feel like it 's not even worth my time or money to go here anymore . <sssss> what happened ?? <sssss> the flavors are still there , but there is some serious cost cutting going on . <sssss> if i was to guess , i think the owners are trying to switch this over to a `` corporate '' establishment . <sssss> this is probably a sad attempt to open more locations . <sssss> i do n't know what they need to do to make it work , and i hate to say it , but i wo n't be back until this is fixed .
?		growing up in chicago , i think i can safely say i know chicago style pizza . <sssss> it 's in my blood . <sssss> i 've been going to oregano 's for years since living in phoenix and it never fails to impress me from location to location . <sssss> it 's chicago style all the way ! <sssss> this past weekend we decided to dine at the paradise valley location and again we were very well taken care of . <sssss> from the greeting you receive when you walk in the door to the service and staff . <sssss> it 's always pleasant . <sssss> what really is something that is n't new to the restaurant business but oregano 's does so well is during the meal , a manager stops by to make sure everything is going well . <sssss> a manager , who was actually quite funny , came out and not just to ask `` how is everything '' . <sssss> no she genuinely made sure all was good made us feel like we are being taken care of . <sssss> in a busy restaurant like this to have that kind of attention is impressive . <sssss> one thing i have to say is a stand out for me and is so incredibly important is consistency . <sssss> it 's the reason i 've been going to oregano 's for years and will continue for years to come . <sssss> we had the stuffed numero one . <sssss> what i would normally call `` deep dish '' in chicago . <sssss> i still get confused about how to order that , but i digress . <sssss> it 's a larger pizza and when you order it they always tell you it will take 45 min 's . <sssss> our server was great about coming back and checking to make sure we were doing ok , filling drinks and making sure all was good . <sssss> the best part of the night ? <sssss> leftovers ! <sssss> if you 're looking for great pizza , excellent service and a nice evening out do yourself a favor and go to oregano 's !
?		there is no place like kobalt . <sssss> since the day it opened , i 've always felt at home here . <sssss> from the staff to just the all around feel of this place is what makes it . <sssss> do n't let it 's location in park central mall fool you . <sssss> i know it seems like a strange place to have a bar , but it just seems to work . <sssss> plus you never have to worry about parking . <sssss> the staff here are what make this place special . <sssss> friendly , engaging and they make a great drink . <sssss> that 's for the great times !
?		the pizza crust at this aptly named pizzeria was the surprise highlight of a recent saturday night visit . <sssss> i did n't care much for the atmosphere , but oh , the dough ! <sssss> beautiful , savory , sexy dough that yields the kind of thin , flaky , flavorful , air-pockety , lightly charred crust that i love * shiver * think neapolitan style , like you might find at bianco or pomo . <sssss> soooo yummy . <sssss> soooooo goo-goo gooey good . <sssss> the amount of sauce and the fresh mozzarella were on target , too . <sssss> so why only 3 stars ? <sssss> alas , the rest of the dining experience simply did n't live up to the restaurant 's upper crusty epithet . <sssss> like the space 's previous native new yorker/brickyard tenants , upper crust is split into two dining areas , the family side and the 21 & over side . <sssss> i 'm going to go ahead and put ironic quotes around `` wine bar '' because : a -rrb- the wine menu is pretty limited , similar to what you would expect at any restaurant . <sssss> b -rrb- there are at least 16 tvs tuned to sports . <sssss> c -rrb- picture a wine bar . <sssss> this is not the place you 're picturing . <sssss> aside from some minor renovations , the interior did n't seem much changed . <sssss> -lsb- insert personal pet peeve : red and white gingham linens . <sssss> uggghh , so kitschy . <sssss> * bad shiver * . <sssss> -rsb- the added patio is a nice touch though , and has ample seats for lounging and dining . <sssss> as much as i was seduced by that fabulous crust -lrb- do n't get me started again -rrb- , the toppings were a bit underwhelming . <sssss> the basics were there , sausage , pepperoni , mushrooms , and they were of good quality , but the neapolitan style crust just begs for some more authentic options like sliced fennel sausage , roasted garlic , prosciutto , basil , or egg -lrb- not all together ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the service was fine . <sssss> considering we were one of two tables , there was potential for over-attention , but our guy was friendly and available when we wanted him and made himself scarce when we did n't . <sssss> as a whole , i think the concept is a little convoluted . <sssss> perhaps they 're trying to please too many different demographics ? <sssss> the fabulous crust is a start , i just wish the menu and ambiance could top it .
?		a recent trip with my husband to yasu last saturday night began with being ignored , followed by more ignoring , and ended with being ignored as we left . <sssss> i was not even wearing my cloak of invisibility . <sssss> we waited at the hostess stand for five minutes before being greeted -lrb- even though the hostess made several trips to the podium without any acknowledgement -rrb- and were then directed to the bar where we sat another five minutes without being greeted or offered a beverage . <sssss> we did however , stare at the bartender while he ate something and ignored us . <sssss> we went to roka akor .
?		this place has my number . <sssss> there just is n't a thing i do n't love about pizzeria bianco . <sssss> it would totally be in the top 10 of an embarrassingly one-dimensional stuff lori likes list : `` waiting at least two hours , fueled by a jammy red , to eat some pizza at 10:00 at night '' . <sssss> naturally , good company and a bowl of meaty olives are a given . <sssss> once , i showed up and there was no wait . <sssss> i went next door first anyway . <sssss> call me crazy , but life goes by too fast . <sssss> i like the wait . <sssss> after an hour or two and some vino , the antipasto is a must for starters . <sssss> local seasonal veggies wood-roasted and drenched in olive oil , cured meat , olives , and some cheese ; it does n't get much better - except when gorgeous heirloom beets are on the platter . <sssss> nothing beats 'em -lrb- do n't groan , it 's impolite -rrb- . <sssss> the neapolitan style wood-fired pizzas are gooey goodness , one and all . <sssss> my personal faves are the rosa -lrb- pungent aged cheese , grilled red onions , and pistachios -rrb- , the margherita with prosciutto , and the wiseguy -lrb- smoked mozzarella , grilled onions and sliced fennel sausage -rrb- . <sssss> and yes , i named half the pizzas on the menu and they are all my favorites . <sssss> housed in an historic building , the atmosphere is rustic and homey . <sssss> a little candlelight and an open kitchen make me feel like i 'm at a friend 's home for dinner - and in some ways i am . <sssss> my first trip to bianco was 13 years ago when my now husband took me for my 21st birthday ; we 've been going ever since . <sssss> maybe that 's why the wait never bothers me . <sssss> with consistently attentive , first-name service and so many familiar faces , it feels less like dinner out and more like an evening among friends .
?		not gon na bother writing a super long and descriptive review with almost 200 reviews before me . <sssss> bottom line i liked this place , i will come back for sure ! <sssss> was told multiple times that i needed to come here and finally did . <sssss> had the pork sandwich on the brunch menu and it was really good . <sssss> the only problem i had with the place was our server was just a little weird , not rude or anything , she just would comment on things that she thought we were looking at on the menu and just kept walking by with her input , but not a big deal . <sssss> and then not like this place could help it but i was really bothered by the other patrons there , the tables are close so i guess you can hear other people more than you would want to but some of these people were just real stuck up . <sssss> being at a trendy place does n't make you super cool , so just chilax and have a good time or go home . <sssss> but yeah , not like they could do anything about it , but if your thinking about going and your a snooty brat , just do n't .
?		defiantly a fan , i have heard nothing but great things about this place but always forgot it was there until we were at the target and starving ! <sssss> i like the whole retro burger shop feel , and i like that the burgers come bare and you tell them what you want on it , i 'm sick of having to say no onions and then even reading it on the receipt , only to get home and have an onion burger in front of me . <sssss> free peanuts are a plus too . <sssss> i was n't a life changing experience but it it defiantly great to have a solid burger joint down the street from us if we ever want a quick meal . <sssss> i 'll drive past a mcd 's for that any day .
?		i do n't have a big review for this place cause i only stopped in for a couple drinks one night after a suns game , but the atmosphere definitely made me want to return for a meal .
?		looking for a cool place to go downtown before a class my fiance have to go to . <sssss> we decided on the roosevelt because 1 . <sssss> it has beer and 2 . <sssss> we like the idea of a house in the historical district being converted into a restaurant . <sssss> we walked in and were immediately impressed with the decor , and even music playing . <sssss> we sat at the bar that was n't crowded at all and looked at the happy hour menu . <sssss> we got some beer that we had never heard of and ordered their giant pretzel , and a chicken pesto sandwich -lrb- was n't on the menu -rrb- and they were both fantastic , we split both but we would have been full if we only got one . <sssss> overall the beer selection was pretty cool , i only took a quick peek at the wine menu , looked pretty good too but i 'm not a wine snob i only like red wine that does n't hurt the wallet . <sssss> the only thing not giving it 5 stars is that the service was excellent , except that everyone that comes here seems to be very regular so they got caught up in conversation when we were trying to get and pay our tab . <sssss> it was n't anything to make you angry but it just took a little too long , especially when you are on a time limit . <sssss> i would love to come here again with some friends when we are downtown again . <sssss> i have already told a bunch of people they need to try it out . <sssss> it 's best to carpool because parking is n't very abundant .
?		this place , in my opinion , is a bit overrated . <sssss> i think part of the reason is because of it 's location in chandler , where there is n't much else . <sssss> on a positive note , yes the decor is nice , with a laid back feel . <sssss> as for the food , we chose a calzone that was smothered in marinara and the `` pasta greek . '' <sssss> the calzone was really good but the pasta dish was lacking flavor . <sssss> the chicken in it was overcooked and tasteless and the one thing that stood out the most were the kalamata olives , which were delicious . <sssss> and for the price of the pasta , i would 've thought the portion was gon na be larger . <sssss> just saying ... this place serves italian right ? <sssss> then where 's my leftovers ? <sssss> derrr . <sssss> i really wanted to try their pizza but i could n't justify $ 16 for a 10 '' pizza when i 've had what i know to be awesome pizzas for less at places like bianco and cibo . <sssss> overall , a pretty decent experience , mostly i 'm sure because of the company , but i probably wo n't go back just because of location and because i think they 're trying too hard but do n't quite deliver .
?		this has become a recent and decent go to hangout when i 'm in the area . <sssss> i 've always liked old chicago for their beer selection . <sssss> at this location i 've had everything from a hamburger to pasta to pizza and it 's always been satisfying . <sssss> as for the beer , i love the rotating seasonal selection , the happy hour prices and the mixed beer concoctions such as the snake bite -lrb- guinness and cider -rrb- . <sssss> nothing super special here but it 's comfortable and i 'll certainly return again and again .
?		so this update is long overdue , since i 've been here several more times in the last year and half since my initial review . <sssss> i dropped my rating for a couple reasons . <sssss> two things people rave about are the goblets and the food . <sssss> well the goblets are only good ice cold and it really sucks when you 're served a beer in one that is room temp and then you see someone else getting one immediately after you , in an ice cold one . <sssss> is it because they 're a regular and know the bartender by name and know their life story ? <sssss> i 'm not sure . <sssss> but would n't an icy goblet served to a non-regular be a good way to entice them to become a regular ? <sssss> as for the food , it is pretty good for the most part . <sssss> above average for bar food . <sssss> but i expect that here because it is more than just a bar . <sssss> families come here for dinner , which is why there 's a separate dining room . <sssss> the edamame is delicious . <sssss> sliders are good . <sssss> pizza is just average , but the thing that really threw me off were the chicken tenders . <sssss> they had to have been the worst i 've ever had . <sssss> it was n't even real chicken . <sssss> it was merely pressed meat . <sssss> you can get better ones at a fast food place . <sssss> however , i love that they have abita turbo dog , among other beers . <sssss> and that it 's a place to cheer for the new orleans saints . <sssss> now if they had a good cup of seafood gumbo ... ...
?		this place is a joke if they think they compare to any sort of respectable wine bar . <sssss> if this comment offends you , feel free to pull down your pants and start crying now . <sssss> after looking over what i would consider the ` cliffs notes ' version of a wine list -lrb- bs on calling yourself a wine cellar -rrb- , we chose a bottle of the onehope red cab . <sssss> i was happy to learn that half the proceeds went to the cure for autism until i realized that the waitstaff could have used the money , as they all had some special needs of their own . <sssss> in an attempt to move past the mediocre start to the evening we moved on to the food menu . <sssss> the tomato/basil/mozzarella bruschetta had no basil -lrb- wtf ? <sssss> -rrb- , the orzo and shrimp starter lacked the red onion it so desperately needed to be a success and who in their right mind serves their pizza on oversized crackers ? <sssss> just because you throw something ` fancy ' on the menu like duck confit does n't mean you have a license to lack on quality . <sssss> thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening . <sssss> if it were n't for the 2-man , live band playing a lively rendition of mygirl in the corner , i do n't know if we would have survived the evening ; -rrb-
?		love this place but giving it a 4 star as it can be somewhat slow and few healthier options to select from . <sssss> yeah i know , penalizing them for not `` healthy '' is probably silly as you know when going to let 's say a fast food joint you are not eating so good . <sssss> that being said the food at defalco 's is very high quality - almost as if you are in italy and am not comparing it to fast food . <sssss> i suggest you wait to try out defalco 's when not in a rush as its worth the wait . <sssss> there order system is very similar to local places back east -lrb- basically avoiding technology -rrb- and that probably ties into part of the slower process of ordering and getting your food . <sssss> i am from back east -lrb- ny area -rrb- and finding a good italian deli / grocery store in the phoenix area is not an easy task . <sssss> a friend introduced me to defalco 's and anytime i am headed south on scottsdale road -lrb- which is often -rrb- and after passing thomas my stomach seems to pick up we are near defalco 's as it starts giving me the rumble noise . <sssss> i have tried many things on the menu such as eggplant parmigiana , chicken parmigiana , and cheese steak and three of those are worth a shot . <sssss> i recommend to bring a friend and each get a different large sandwich and share .
?		grandparents had the kids so took advantage of the opportunity to relax and with my wife checked out the kitchen near our house in scottsdale . <sssss> we were looking for a little nicer/unique restaurant in scottsdale where we could grab a nice glass of wine and the kitchen definitely lived up to our expectations . <sssss> the kitchen was a great spot -lrb- really nice atmosphere - very wide open -rrb- for that . <sssss> i would have given it a 5 star but took off 1 star as we were somewhat confused walking in as we had not been there before . <sssss> i guess during lunch they do n't have table service so you go in , choose the items you want and then bring your food to the table . <sssss> we had to go to bar to get a glass of wine . <sssss> if they had waiter service this would have definitely been a 5 star rating . <sssss> the experience of paying for our food , having to find a table , going back up to get our food , going somewhere else to get a drink , etc. just seemed a little confusing and unnecessary . <sssss> ideally it would have been to place order for food and drink , pay at the register , and then someone brought us our food and drink . <sssss> the food was really good though -lrb- little pricey -lrb- $ 10-14 per person with small side but excluding drink -rrb- but worth it . <sssss> we tried out a jambon sandwich -lrb- ham on baguette -rrb- , muffaletta -lrb- capicola , salami , swiss , provolone and olive salad on ciabatta -rrb- , beet salad , and a pad thai pasta side . <sssss> of course , 2 nice glasses of wine . <sssss> the jambon sandwich and pad thai salad were quite delicious and definitely going to get that again next time . <sssss> the pad thai had a really great spice to it and wish i got more of that . <sssss> the beets were good but not anything out of this world . <sssss> adding some wine to the lunch made it that much better and the wine selection was really good -lrb- but a little pricey $ 10-15 / glass -rrb- . <sssss> all in all if you are up for a great lunch in scottsdale and looking for something different than a typical scottsdale restaurant to experience definitely check out the kitchen .
?		very good food but a little overpriced for the amount of food you get so the price is the only reason i am giving it a 3 star instead of a 4 star . <sssss> cost about $ 11.50 for a small sandwich side salad and an ice tea . <sssss> all the food seems to be of the organic nature so definitely taste is higher quality . <sssss> i have been there 3 times and each time left still hungry ; however , did feel that i had a healthier lunch than other options in the area . <sssss> if you are in the mood for a high quality / healthy light lunch and okay with paying $ 10-12 per person definitely give essence bakery a shot .
?		great food and drinks . <sssss> the service was excellent ! <sssss> if you go with a group of four or more on a saturday night , plan to wait about an hour and 30 minutes , which really was n't that bad as there was plenty of space on the patio and the bar tenders were quick at pouring the drinks .
?		i absolutely love coming here to watch movies . <sssss> being able to pick my seat ahead of time and have a cocktail while watching a movie is awesome ! <sssss> the icing on the cake is the 21 and up cinema suites . <sssss> the food is n't bad but i normally eat elsewhere before heading here . <sssss> if you 're drinking , go for beer or cocktails , the wine is typically warm and a little overpriced . <sssss> the beer gets you the most bang for your buck especially if you get a pitcher .
?		i was very excited about this opening as i 've been to their denver location a few times . <sssss> it did not dissapoint ! <sssss> we went on opening day and the food and service we great ! <sssss> i 'm fairly picky so i stuck with the plain ` ol and it was perfect ! <sssss> my friends swear by their more adventurous pancakes so if you 're into experimenting i 've heard they 're delicious .
?		i 'm torn . <sssss> this place is so darn charming , a very warm atmosphere , much cozier than its previous identity . <sssss> the service during my -- brief -- visit was amazing : i was waited on immediately upon entering the door , but i wanted to order something to go , so i bellied up to the bar for a menu . <sssss> my first thought ? <sssss> the menu is boring . <sssss> nothing about it makes it stand out . <sssss> `` what is new and different here ? <sssss> , '' is what i thought to myself . <sssss> `` what is the one thing that will bring people back again and again ? '' <sssss> , i thought to myself . <sssss> i was told the chopped salad was amazing , so i ordered it . <sssss> in the meantime , i ordered a glass of wine . <sssss> i had only been there a few short minutes , when another server came over to ask if i would like to try some other red wines . <sssss> perhaps it was chance , but i noticed , she brought two reds in the same `` family '' of that which i was drinking . <sssss> very observant , i thought to myself . <sssss> i was n't happy with either , really , and i was definitely not happy with the glass i ordered , so the bartender took it off the bill at the time my food arrived . <sssss> terrific ! <sssss> i took home my salad , opened it , and was immediately disappointed . <sssss> it was not fresh , and i expected the chicken breast to be hot , which it was not . <sssss> the greens were n't even `` juicy , '' but rather tasted as though they had been in the refrigerator waaay too long . <sssss> not even close to amazing , as i was told . <sssss> so , i may return and eat in the restaurant because i think it is only fair , but i have to say , i 'm not very enthusiastic about it . <sssss> : - -lrb-
?		i have eaten lunch here -lrb- sandwich , chips , obligatory pickle -rrb- , but i am specifically yelping about the bakery . <sssss> i purchased a `` holly go-lightly '' cake for my mother to celebrate mother 's day , and was really disappointed . <sssss> the price is steep -lrb- over $ 30 for an 8 inch cake ... maybe it was even a 6 inch cake ... -rrb- but i have always been willing to pay for those extra special touches . <sssss> but there was nothing special about this cake . <sssss> i admit , i was taken in by the glittered frosting , however , the frosting was not as good as most buttercream frosting on your average wedding cake . <sssss> and the -lsb- yellow -rsb- cake itself was dry . <sssss> my mother said that maybe we did not serve it appropriately -lrb- meaning , that cake is ideally served at room temperature as opposed to directly from the refrigerator -rrb- but come on , we know good cake when we taste it , cold or warm . <sssss> so , after the `` ooh '' and `` ahh '' i received upon opening the box , that was the last of the compliments .
?		i am a total sucker for quaint bungalow style homes . <sssss> -lrb- i used to own one , a sears bungalow , 1920 . <sssss> -rrb- so this adorable bar/lounge had me as soon as i walked onto the wraparound porch and into the front door . <sssss> i could smell the character . <sssss> this is a wonderful venue for a date , or , in my case , for a small group of friends to gather . <sssss> it has ambiance and then some ! <sssss> you know that friend of yours who has the great cocktail parties ? <sssss> that is what it feels like here when the bartender asks for your order . <sssss> no positioning to get to him , no yelling your order to him . <sssss> he 's right there ... all for you . <sssss> wow . <sssss> i am getting nostalgic here , so let me close with these couple of important details : 1 -rrb- the wine selection was small but the wines were good , and 2 -rrb- the cheese/cracker/olive food pairings were quite good . <sssss> i left feeling that i had just had a wonderful experience . <sssss> interestingly , there is a bar/lounge in raleigh , north carolina that i still remember fondly , years later , because it gave me that same feeling . <sssss> i can not wait for the opportunity to return .
?		wow , what a relief . <sssss> i am so glad to see an average yelp rating of 3 stars . <sssss> i was worried that i was crazy because when i arrived , i read multiple `` best of ... '' awards -lrb- you know the ones -rrb- , but by the time the meal was over , i was thinking , `` best of what !? '' <sssss> i am so glad my fellow yelpers agreed with me : this place has great atmosphere , but the food is average at best . <sssss> to their credit , i walked through an incredibly great patio , perfect for arizona winters , on my way to the main entrance . <sssss> but it reminds me of tortilla factory in scottsdale . <sssss> you do n't go for the food . <sssss> you go for the patio .
?		i love this place ! <sssss> love , love , love ...
?		i have not returned yet -lrb- although i expect to soon as i have a planned event at press next week -rrb- , but i think it is fair to share that the owner contacted me regarding my review . <sssss> he was , of course , in his words , `` disturbed ... all i can say is i apologize for your experience and only ask that you give us a second try if you are in the area . '' <sssss> that is good reputation management , and appreciated by me !
?		i really , really , really want to give this restaurant five stars , however , at the end of the evening , i became sick ... you know ... contaminated food type sick . <sssss> i did love the experience in the restaurant , however . <sssss> -lrb- not to be confused with the bar , which was lacking in attentiveness . <sssss> -rrb- sean , however , made up for the poor experience we received in the bar when we got to the restaurant . <sssss> he was very attentive , very conscientious , and very friendly . <sssss> i really love the concept . <sssss> and my meal -lrb- scallops -rrb- was so delicious ! <sssss> and the dessert ... omg ... the dessert ! <sssss> i had three ! <sssss> yummy ! <sssss> even though i became sick , i will try it again . <sssss> there were enough good experiences to entice me to return once more and give it another try .
?		yes , the staff is amazing : very conscientious , very friendly , and the general manager , tracy , stopped several times to chat with us . <sssss> the tots are amazing , but when i complained to tracy that they must have been cooked in the same oil as the fish , he did not hesitate one second to offer us a second dish of sweet potato tots , on the house ! <sssss> i was there with a friend for lunch , and the place was hopping with a good crowd . <sssss> it is a tavern like atmosphere but brighter , cleaner , and more welcoming !
?		i love this little restaurant . <sssss> a friend suggested it to me , and i have been recommending it to others ever since . <sssss> it is absolutely charming , the food is good -lrb- and a fair helping at a fair price -rrb- , and the waitstaff was both efficient and friendly ! <sssss> i can not wait to try it again next week !
?		i know i may be squashed by my fellow yelpers but ... i have not been impressed by breakfast here . <sssss> i 've been here three times now , and the breakfast has been sub-par each time . <sssss> in all honesty , i have not been here for lunch or dinner so ... take my review for what it is worth to you . <sssss> i hope to be able to try another meal , but i come here after my morning hike at gateway loop . <sssss> i still love this place because it is such a surprise in the middle of the desert ! <sssss> on the outside , you see a car wash and gas station , but on the inside , the gift store rivals ajs ! <sssss> and in fact , the last time i was there , i was there only to purchase earrings for a saturday night out !
?		just go here , now . <sssss> i really mean it ... go . <sssss> real scandinavian folk , homemade and insanely good food . <sssss> be prepared to wait a bit for your food . <sssss> each dish is made to order so enjoy some good conversation in the mean time .
?		above average pho . <sssss> the chicken they use is kind of grizzly and nasty in my opinion . <sssss> establishment is super nice and clean . <sssss> awesome atmosphere without a doubt . <sssss> big bonus : lots of hot vietnamese women working in the kitchen .
?		good selection of sandwiches for a great price . <sssss> the bread was very fresh and scrumptious . <sssss> they also have the best pepperoncini ! <sssss> the place was huge and clean . <sssss> i will be going back for more for sure .
?		the person above with ` duplicate review ' has a link to a different restaurant . <sssss> this is hana japanese eatery on 7th st. corkage , byob ! <sssss> this is my favorite sushi/japanese restaurant in town right now . <sssss> unfortunately they do not serve alcohol , but you can bring your own sake , wine or beer -lrb- just stop at aj 's on camelback and central on your way in -rrb- . <sssss> incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi , always fabulous specials on the board , and interesting items like fresh halibut or red striped bass really make for some great sashimi . <sssss> service can be excellent to horrible -lrb- had a very bad server at lunch once -rrb- but is normally excellent , this is a family run business and the japanese influence is seen in the fabulous dishes . <sssss> make sure you order your favorite sushi rolls or sashimi , even if it is n't on the short menu . <sssss> they are glad to make anything you ask for if they have it available . <sssss> i had one of the best salmon skin handrolls i 've had anywhere in the world here . <sssss> and the tuna tataki with crunchy roasted garlic was out of this world . <sssss> i 'm a sashimi lover but these specials on the board have to be ordered because they are that good . <sssss> one night they had a special seaweed with lemon peel and green onions that i will order any time i see it available , amazing flavor and texture , very japanese . <sssss> mmmm . <sssss> not open for lunch on saturday or sunday , closed on mondays . <sssss> regular hours through the week .
?		average sushi here , pretty good lunch specials . <sssss> nothing to write home about but if you are hungry and in the area , its a decent meal . <sssss> prices are mid to high for sushi . <sssss> come in , eat , get out ...
?		marcellino and sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month italy vacation -lrb- re-opened september 10th -rrb- ... and are we glad they are back ! <sssss> we had a fabulous duo appetizer : fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet -lrb- carpaccio -rrb- with shaved mushroom and black truffle ! <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> i 've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon , but the fresh fig was tremendous ! <sssss> marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread , mmmm , amazing . <sssss> i do n't think you can get this anywhere -lrb- fresh -rrb- , even here if you ask for it , but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time ! <sssss> pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle . <sssss> best hand made pastas anywhere . <sssss> perfect ! <sssss> main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables ... and more truffles ! <sssss> so right ... so full ! <sssss> i 'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey ! <sssss> we ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go ! <sssss> what a perfect italian dinner paradise ! <sssss> we ca n't wait to go back for opera night ... and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner . <sssss> best in the valley .
?		what a pleasant surprise this was . <sssss> we had ventured to this part of tempe to finally visit the crepe bar , but sadly it was closed for the holidays - so this was the closest joint with solid reviews & we went for it . <sssss> instantly wary when you 're the only couple dining in a new place , but it was the day after christmas - and an odd time , so we did n't think too much of it . <sssss> here are a few tips : must.get.garlic.knots ! <sssss> i 've had too many greasy bread-sticks in my day , this was nothing like that - and came with a nice cup o ' marinara to dip them in . <sssss> also , get the baked ziti - it 's a cheese-splosion . <sssss> fresh mozzarella , ricotta and delicious baked goodness . <sssss> we also got the veal parmigiano - which was just spot on . <sssss> great service , reasonable prices , and shockingly authentic and fresh ... we will be back for sure !
?		so , i 've been to whole foods before - and it 's always a visual treat . <sssss> great selection , fresh , natural foods , lots of beautiful & healthy soccer moms strutting about - but last night was the 1st time i visited their watering hole . <sssss> immediately , i was impressed with the selection of craft beers on tap , and stumbled into a couple thursday specials that i appreciated . <sssss> my low rating , this time , is for the idiot bartender and his poor service . <sssss> here 's the thing - i get it - you are kind of a hippie if you work at whole foods . <sssss> but a condescending british hippie is not what i need after a long day at work . <sssss> once again , the beer was tasty , the place was clean , the prices were reasonable , but the service was intolerable . <sssss> do n't insult my country , do n't insult my country 's past-times , and do n't insult my intelligence by thinking you 've gotten one over on me without my knowing . <sssss> to the gm of this particular location - find yourself a bartender who is n't a jerk and i 'll come back for sure .
?		sadly , i think this place is suffering from `` i do n't know what i want to be '' itis . <sssss> in the past , we 've gone for the happy / reverse happy hour and had great experiences . <sssss> but , saturday , unfortunately , it was just not good at all . <sssss> it was 9:45 pm , on a friday , but since they did n't close until 11 i figured we were ok . <sssss> the only empty table that was clean was at the sushi bar - which looked nice due to the enormous fish tank . <sssss> sadly , that 's when the nice part of the evening ended . <sssss> immediately after sitting down , one of the sushi chefs started breaking down / cleaning the entire bar whist mean mugging us and the rest of the patrons . <sssss> i then realized i could n't even hear myself think . <sssss> between the sauced people in the lounge , to the house music blaring overhead , i thought , for a moment , i was stuck in an over-priced lounge in vegas . <sssss> our waiter , who i 'm pretty sure was an extra on the jersey shore , took our order and it only took twelve minutes to deliver the drinks . <sssss> then , two of the three sushi rolls that were ordered made it to us , along with completely un-seasoned sliders and greasier than it should 've been flatbread . <sssss> a manager noticed my sad face and asked what was wrong , after explaining it to him -lrb- i think he heard me -rrb- he came back with $ 6 taken off the tab for the grease . <sssss> it was a nice attempt at saving face , but not enough to right the sour note . <sssss> alas , kg , we will not be back .
?		do n't let the blase exterior -lrb- with the exception of the amazing mural -rrb- fool you at this joint ... it 's much bigger than it looks from the outside . <sssss> the only food i tried was their margherita pizza , which was fresh and tasty - but far from my favorite . <sssss> i will reserve judgment on the rest of the menu items until i try , but their beer selection is just impeccable . <sssss> rotating taps with every kind imaginable , a great happy hour , and friendly service = must try if you love beer . <sssss> i really loved the open design , the back patio -lrb- especially between october and may -rrb- are perfect for this part of phoenix . <sssss> it 's like , for a moment , you forget where you are . <sssss> very zen like , and peaceful place to enjoy a drink - at least until they get busy , and then it 's still great , just not as quiet . <sssss> must try if you 're needing a drink downtown , i will surely be back .
?		ok , i 've been to this place probably ten times . <sssss> and most of the choices we 're so-so ... but recently , i was introduced to their orange creamsicle . <sssss> it has two levels of deliciousness , and every time i try one it blows my mind . <sssss> it 's like the top level has flash frozen fresh squeezed orange juice on it , and the bottom level is the perfect blend of creamy orange goodness . <sssss> it 's without question , hands down , the best popsicle i 've ever put in my mouth . <sssss> go try one !!
?		so the place has christmas lights , and a fair amount of ambiance , and supposedly there 's a shirtless shot at 1:00 - which might make going back worth it . <sssss> other than that , the service was less than lackluster , the domestic kegs all seemed flat . <sssss> in other words , go somewhere else unless it 's 1:00 and you want to see some daytime nudity .
?		had a lunch date here ... i had the grilled swordfish tacos and i forgot what he had ... i think the grilled ahi tuna . <sssss> portions were on the smaller size for the price -lrb- yes even for lunch -rrb- . <sssss> i kind of felt bad , because i picked the place and he paid ... and i just felt it was waaaay to expensive for a lunch . <sssss> we did have cocktails so our bill was definitely more than $ 60 . <sssss> we did enjoy the patio ... even in january when the weather is perfect here ! <sssss> not so sure i 'd do lunch again for the price !!!
?		i thought grayhawk golf club had good sliders ... this place takes the prize . <sssss> they are true angus beef baby ! <sssss> nice bar and outdoor patio area . <sssss> watched the ncaa playoffs their -lrb- ua -rrb- ... great spot ... not too crowded mixed with good company ... just right !!
?		went to cg again tonight and definitely redeemed itself . <sssss> had the lobster bisque soup for appi and shared the sliced filet mignon with cippolini onions and wild mushrooms with my girlfriend and was definitely very happy with this selection . <sssss> the fresh warm hot rolls were exceptional as well . <sssss> definitely a fun time . <sssss> may be even willing to give bourbon steak a second try ... especially because it 's so close to home !
?		most people know houston 's . <sssss> its a good standby . <sssss> the service is always great and i love how the servers work as a team . <sssss> houston 's has fantastic burgers if you did n't know . <sssss> tip : they serve a strawberry shortcake for dessert in the summer . <sssss> its perfect & not too sweet ! <sssss> the strawberries are gynormous and served atop a house made poppyseed shortcake w / fresh whipped cream ! <sssss> mouth watering yet ? <sssss> oh and one more tip : i do n't know why they do n't have this on the menu , but you can order beer-battered chicken fingers . <sssss> order extra crispy . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> bon appetite !
?		pretty darn good ! <sssss> had the vegetarian combo . <sssss> the falafal was super slammin ' ! <sssss> but the hummus and baba ganoush were a little bland to me . <sssss> so disappointing ! <sssss> next time , i 'll have what my friends had ... a good old fashioned gyro ! <sssss> oh , and if you dare , try the arabic coffee . <sssss> it 's a jolt ! <sssss> one last tip , if you 're going for lunch , do n't go straight at noon , there 's usually a long line for a table -lrb- always a good sign tho ' -rrb- .
?		windsor is like postino and vig had a baby ! <sssss> of course we had to start with the corn dog bites . <sssss> i love these little nuggets of state fair gold . <sssss> there were a few pieces of friend pickle chips in the basket -lrb- on purpose -rrb- ... nice surprise ! <sssss> the russian roulettes are a bowl of japanese shishito peppers that are charred and served warm . <sssss> i like them with a little squeeze of lemon . <sssss> deviled egg dip & homemade chips were better than i imagined . <sssss> i have to figure out how to make this appetizer . <sssss> i think it would be a big hit with friends . <sssss> after all the apps , we were full , so my friend and i ended up splitting the new orleans baby back rib dinner . <sssss> the ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor was smokey with a hint of sweet and heat . <sssss> we had it with a side of cole slaw . <sssss> i 'm usually a such a lady at the dinner table , but i had to lick my fingers a couple times !! <sssss> for desert , do n't forget to head next door to churn for some of the best artesian ice cream in town ! <sssss> enjoy !
?		i love this sexy , modern chic restaurant with the equally inviting menu . <sssss> everything from the textured walls , cool-looking servers and the interesting play on classic american food is wonderful ! <sssss> the happy hour mon-fri from 3-6p is great ! <sssss> unlike some happy hour menus where they serve the unpopular items in small hh portions , ms 's hh menu is real food with real portions . <sssss> i have to confess that the one thing that i love more than anything else on the menu is ... drum roll please ... . <sssss> the sour cherry fix -lrb- yes , ladies and gentlemen , a cocktail -rrb- ! <sssss> its made with vox vodka , lemon and house-made sour cherry jam . <sssss> the drink is mixed with crushed ice then the sour cherry jam is drizzled on top ! <sssss> omg ! <sssss> its like an ice-slushy for adults ! <sssss> sour cherry fix on a hot arizona day , and i 'm in heaven ! <sssss> enjoy !
?		the happy hour was better than i expected ! <sssss> love this place .
?		been there for lunch a couple of times . <sssss> the first time i was not impressed , and rather neutral about the experience . <sssss> but i thought it was because i was on the phone w / biz the entire time . <sssss> went last week w / a few folks from my office . <sssss> omg ! <sssss> we were thoroughly disappointed . <sssss> let 's start w / the chips and salsa . <sssss> they serve a complementary salsa trio . <sssss> red , green and pico de gallo . <sssss> the traditional salsa was borderline gross ! <sssss> no flavor and funky texture . <sssss> the salsa verde was ok but not great . <sssss> i asked for hot salsa ... they did n't have one . <sssss> huh ??! <sssss> the food was par at best and the service was worse ! <sssss> the restaurant was not busy and we had to search for our server for any and everything . <sssss> we had to ask for our check and 15 min later , she still had n't come to collect the bill . <sssss> tick tock ! <sssss> tick tock ! <sssss> c'mon lady ... i 've got stuff to do !!! <sssss> i had to take the credit card to her !!! <sssss> the icing on the cake was my asking for a to-go cup for my freshly poured iced tea . <sssss> she brought me a soup container !! <sssss> no thanks ! <sssss> meh ! <sssss> i 'm cool on this place !
?		the lamb kisra -lrb- basically a pizza or flatbread -rrb- is soooooooo damn good ! <sssss> the salad selection will make even the most focused foodie indecisive . <sssss> not because there are too many selections , but b/c they 're all so interestingly delish ! <sssss> the atmoshpere is super cool and funky . <sssss> great for small groups . <sssss> this restaurant group is known for their out-of-the-box menus . <sssss> unfortunately however , the service can sometimes be spotty .
?		i love pita jungle 's food -lrb- service is another story -rrb- !! <sssss> never had a bad meal . <sssss> and what i love most of all is the lemon dressing they use on the greek salad . <sssss> it 's soooo light and refreshing . <sssss> the only thing i do n't like is that they do n't serve pepperochini with it . <sssss> i could eat those things whole ! <sssss> pita jungle where are my peppers ?? <sssss> anyway , as far as the service , i 've got ta agree w / robert a . <sssss> at both the shea and indian school locations , the service is very spotty . <sssss> in fact , i was just at the shea location last night , and after being seated outside ... in the sun ... we were not greeted by our server for 7 min ! <sssss> ummmm ... no water ... no iced tea ... not even a `` hello i 'll be right with you '' !!! <sssss> on the flip side , the kitchen is lightening fast . <sssss> no kidding , our food was at our table shortly after we finally got our iced tea ! <sssss> the indian school location is worse for service . <sssss> because the location is so small , its like the servers are pissy just so you 'll want to leave and they can rotate your table !
?		`` surprisingly good '' as one reviewer wrote ! <sssss> so true ! <sssss> odd looking place when you first walk in . <sssss> menu is odd too and looks like a newspaper . <sssss> but odd in a good way . <sssss> all i can say is ... the rellenos are so so sinful ! <sssss> goce !
?		as usual , the collard greens were hit or miss . <sssss> and this time was another `` miss '' . <sssss> waaayyy too peppery ! <sssss> also as usual , the side dishes for one of the guests in my party did n't come out until after three requests for them ... and probably 15 minutes after chicken & waffles came out . <sssss> the waffles were underdone . <sssss> finally , as usual , the service was spotty .
?		went to defalco 's for lunch recently and was instantly consumed by the smell of fresh bread , garlic and sauces . <sssss> like walking into an italian grandmother 's kitchen . <sssss> intoxicating . <sssss> the deli case stocked full of salami , pastrami and every other - ami you can imagine ! <sssss> there were olives , cheeses and already prepared dishes that you can eat there or take home . <sssss> i ordered the cheese lasagna . <sssss> you pay for it , take a number and wait . <sssss> while waiting , let your eyes and senses shop the grocery area with all sorts of imported pastas , sauces and other products . <sssss> you ca n't be in a rush with this place . <sssss> about 10-12 minutes later , voila ! <sssss> my lasagna arrived to the table with a warm , crusty side of garlic bread . <sssss> so damn good ! <sssss> i simply can not wait to stop in again . <sssss> bon appetite ~
?		atlas is a place for the foodies , the gastronomers , folks with a trained palate and the adventurous . <sssss> not your place if you need buffalo wings , burgers and fries or a grilled chicken salad . <sssss> like their website states : `` organic , hand foraged , local , wild , line caught , sustainable and exotic are just some of terms you will find on the menu that our chefs revise daily '' . <sssss> i love that ! <sssss> the fun part is it 's a byob restaurant ... attached to a wine shoppe -lrb- az wine company -rrb- . <sssss> so if you do n't bring your own , shop next door first . <sssss> wine pairing assistance available . <sssss> reservations are highly recommended .
?		i first went to crust over 5 years ago and the food has always been fairly good . <sssss> after the disaster that was the street eats festival today , i was happy to go eat lunch at crust instead . <sssss> i went with the bf and another couple -lrb- erin b and her bf -rrb- . <sssss> we all shared the meat and cheese plate , which was good , but nothing extraordinary . <sssss> we each got a rustica pizza and they were all really good , i got the classic , the bf got the new york , erin got the one with pesto and bacon , and her bf got the meat . <sssss> these pizzas are a funny shape , but still tasty . <sssss> we did n't have the best service today ... our water was empty through most of the meal , but generally the service is good . <sssss> i do wish they would bring back the ` pot brownie ' ... a brownie in a metal pot with banana , nuts , ice cream , whipped cream ... completely delicious and amazing ... how can that not be on the menu ???? <sssss> overall , a pretty solid pizza place .
?		my whole family went here last night for my oldest brother 's birthday . <sssss> this restaurant was very accommodating to our large party . <sssss> they even sat us before everyone was there , and we appreciated that . <sssss> we ordered a bunch of food , a couple pizzas , a couple sandwiches , bruschetta , salad , ravioli , meatballs ... a lot of food . <sssss> their pizza is always good and my brother swears that this location is the best and has the best crust of all the locations . <sssss> i thought the pizza was good , the italian salad dressing was very good , and the ravioli and meatballs were tasty . <sssss> i thought the bruschetta was just ok ... but overall , this place is very good . <sssss> i would recommend it to anyone for some classic italian food , plus about 10 of us ate for 100 $ ... pretty good deal .
?		i went here for linner today as i had a groupon -lrb- yay for using up my groupons ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the bf and i got there around 3 oclock so the place was n't so busy , there were still a few tables in there , though . <sssss> they have some interesting things on their menu , but i decided to be kind of safe and got the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad combo with the thyme chicken and goat cheese salad . <sssss> they were both good , but the sandwich was better than the salad . <sssss> the salad looks like they always use the same base salad and then just throw the extras that make it a ` specialty ' salad on top . <sssss> that was alright though . <sssss> i thought the fried goat cheese was good , the balsamic that i got with it was weirdly thick , but tasted good . <sssss> the chicken on the sandwich was tasty . <sssss> the thing that got me was they make this huge deal out of their making their own bread , but it 's not anything special . <sssss> it kind of tastes like nothing ... weird . <sssss> the bf got the still crazy after all these years sandwich , which is fried mozzarella and veggie -lrb- which was what i wanted ! <sssss> but the bf is pickier than me so i let him have it -rrb- . <sssss> this was pretty good too ... i mean , what is n't when it 's fried ? <sssss> he said the sandwich would have been better had it had fried tomatoes and melted cheese instead of fried cheese ... i thought it tasted good . <sssss> he got fries as his side -lrb- even though i urged him to get the mashed potato pie thing ... * sigh -rrb- and they were good , they tasted kind of beer battered . <sssss> although this place was good , i would n't wait in line to eat here .
?		i went back here last night with my mom as last time we went my mom asked for half of her burger in a doggie bag and when she got home it was n't in the bag , so my mom called and talked with chris who is the manager -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- , and he was so sweet and told her to come back and he 'd give her another burger on the house . <sssss> so we went , we got the coconut shrimp , which are n't like i remember them from when i was a kid , but i liked them and i normally do n't like shrimp at all . <sssss> i ordered a double baked -lrb- droool ... this is the best item at this restaurant ... all bacon - y and delicious and a house salad which was just ok , but what do you expect , it 's a house salad . <sssss> we also got a slice of chocolate cake that comes with fudge ... the fudge ... mmmmmmmm sooooo good ! <sssss> that was definitely a good choice . <sssss> chris really went the extra mile to give us really good customer service and we really appreciate that . <sssss> i guess that is what makes this restaurant stand out .
?		the food here is alright , however , the service is not very good . <sssss> i went on a thursday night and it was pretty busy . <sssss> i sat outside because that was the only area with open seating . <sssss> unfortunately i sat right by some people smoking -lrb- not the restaurant 's fault , but not pleasant either -rrb- . <sssss> it took 20 minutes for our order to be taken and another 45 minutes to get our food . <sssss> when i finally came , it was good and i like their concept , it just took too long . <sssss> i was told that the pasties are premade so there ca n't be any substitutions in them , yet it took so long to make them . <sssss> . <sssss> curious . <sssss> anyway , i would give them a second chance , but as of now , they were not such a good experience .
?		let me start by saying that this is a preliminary review ... i have a groupon for dinner here , so i will definitely be trying it again and will update then . <sssss> ok , so yesterday the bf and i went here for breakfast to celebrate my graduation and because i wanted to try it -lrb- what can i say , i buy into the food network hype -rrb- . <sssss> i made a reservation , which was completely unnecessary because the restaurant was empty -lrb- not to mention huuuge -rrb- . <sssss> i ordered the steak and eggs and the bf had the pancakes with the tequila raisins and whatnot . <sssss> the portion sizes were small and the prices were high . <sssss> my steak was alright , but had a burnt kind of flavor and not a lot of seasoning ... one of my eggs was overcooked -lrb- asked for over medium , one was over hard -rrb- . <sssss> i wish they put some kind of sauce or chimichurri or something on the steak to give it a little more flavor . <sssss> the beans that came with it were alright , but had some bacon or something in it that was limp and chewy ... not awesome . <sssss> the bf 's pancakes were really tasty ... the problem was that they cost 12 $ and were about the size of 1.5 small pancakes at most restaurants ... not a lot of food . <sssss> their coffee was good , which it should be at 4 $ a cup and we were able to have a few refills of it . <sssss> i think the prices are inflated due to the food network connection and location . <sssss> the service was alright , although a bit lacking considering the place was completely empty . <sssss> i am still looking forward to using my groupon because it 's hard to tell how the food will be based on breakfast , but i would not come here for breakfast again ... for the same price go to province or go to morning glory for breakfast ... ps the decor of this restaurant is awesome and i want a sparkly pink table for my future house : - p
?		# 100 for 2013 ! <sssss> woot ! <sssss> anyway , i went to solo for my birthday dinner with my mom and it was very good ! <sssss> we shared the funghi pizza and the pasta with the nettle pesto . <sssss> the pizza was great , it was fresh and earthy . <sssss> it had a pancetta agrodulce on it , which was good , kind of like a dressing , but i thought it would have had pieces of pancetta on it . <sssss> the pasta was also very good , the pesto was delicious and the peas were fresh . <sssss> we shared a bottle of delicious moscato d'asti , half priced because it was wednesday , and for dessert we had the budino which was nice and tasted like nutella and was very tasty . <sssss> on top of all that , the prices were very reasonable . <sssss> i had plenty of food for lunch for 2 days after the meal . <sssss> i would definitely come back to solo again !!!
?		let me start by giving this place some props . <sssss> the first time i tried oink was at the new times phoenix a ` fare and i had their bacon donut ... and it was amazing ! <sssss> so fast forward to a couple weeks ago , the bf and i went to oink for breakfast . <sssss> i had the bacon eggs benedict with the honey bacon . <sssss> it was good , but the hollandaise was a little on the sour side . <sssss> the eggs were cooked perfectly , however , which i can appreciate . <sssss> the somewhat downfall was the bf 's breakfast . <sssss> he got the pancakes with bacon inside and they just were n't that special . <sssss> i make pancakes with bacon inside at home that are better and more flavorful ... i do give them credit for their theme and for their creative use of bacon , but the quality of the pancake batter needs to be increased . <sssss> now , of course we had to get another maple bacon donut for later ... ohhh it was soooo goood ! <sssss> overall , bacon donut = 5 stars , overall experience = just okay , but i would definitely give them another shot if i were in the neighborhood .
?		i went to poncho 's today for lunch with the bf and it was ok . <sssss> the place was very busy , so i thought that was a good sign . <sssss> we waited for a bit before being seated in one of the small rooms in the back . <sssss> we were given chips and the salsa in the bowl and promised salsa in a bottle . <sssss> the chips were very greasy and not that crunchy and the salsa tasted like very peppery ketchup ... ick . <sssss> after 5 minutes or so we were given the squeeze bottle which contained a very similar , but slightly less tomato - y , salsa ... not a win . <sssss> for lunch , i had the mini pollo fundido and the bf had a taco and tostada . <sssss> my food was alright , the chicken on the inside of the burro was nothing special , but the sauce was good and the rice was really good . <sssss> sort of what i expect from a cheap americanized mexican restaurant . <sssss> the bf 's taco was fine ... also nothing special , but not bad . <sssss> the prices were decent and the portion sizes were too large . <sssss> i think it 's super funny that they are clinging to the fact that bill clinton ate here 15 years ago or so , they have the newspaper clippings all over ... i definitely lol 'd . <sssss> anyway , i would n't avoid this place , but i would n't go out of my way to come back .
?		i must be a sucker for wine bars ... they are just so good ! <sssss> i went to timo after finding it on yelp while hiking north mountain with my step mom deb . <sssss> we were hiking and , of course , thinking about food ... lol . <sssss> so we went to timo , which is this cute little place that is largely hidden from the road by big trees . <sssss> we sat on the patio for sunday brunch . <sssss> the service was great , very attentive and the atmosphere was wonderful ... so relaxing . <sssss> they did n't even treat us badly despite our being dirty and -lrb- probably -rrb- smelly . <sssss> we shared the bacon and fig -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- pizza and the rocket salad . <sssss> the pizza was huge and ridiculously good ... the pizza was piled with bacon and sweet onions ... so flavorful . <sssss> the salad was also good ... it had sort of weird dried raspberries and blueberries on it that were almost like croutons because they were crunchy but had the flavor of the fruit ... yum . <sssss> i would definitely come back here again ... maybe next time i 'll try the benedict -lrb- which also looked pretty fabulous -rrb- .
?		this was definitely a meh experience ... although i guess that should have been expected . <sssss> i built my own burger with a wheat bun , cheddar , lettuce , haystack onion , ketchup and mustard . <sssss> it was greasy and underwhelming . <sssss> all i could taste was the mustard ... i think there was too much of it . <sssss> the bf and i shared some smashfries which were weird tasting ... not really good ... just weird . <sssss> i was hoping for more garlic flavor . <sssss> overall ... it was just a meh experience .
?		i really like the cracker barrel for breakfast , mainly because it holds a lot of people so there 's never a really long wait and it 's cheap . <sssss> like dirt cheap . <sssss> you can not go out to breakfast for less except maybe at the waffle house . <sssss> this place is far superior to the waffle house . <sssss> i have n't been here for any other meal , but the breakfast is good . <sssss> it is a chain , but when you don ' want to spend a lot , it 's a good option . <sssss> also , they have eggs in a basket ... i loved that as a kid ! <sssss> props to that .
?		um ... yes please ! <sssss> this is one of those cases where the idiom ` you ca n't judge a book by its cover ' really applies . <sssss> this place looks awful from the outside ... like a place you would never want to go , but do not be fooled ! <sssss> i went here yesterday with my dad and brother for the lunch buffet and it was killer ! <sssss> there was a wide variety of dishes including chicken tikka masala -lrb- my fave dish -rrb- , a spinach curry , a vegetarian meatball in curry , a stewed goat dish -lrb- which was ah mazing -rrb- , and even desserts and chai tea . <sssss> they also come around and bring naan to your table . <sssss> all for like 9 $ per person ! <sssss> the food here i thought was really really good , and for the price you ca n't beat it . <sssss> i 've paid double or more to eat at some other indian restaurants around tempe , and i can honestly say that this was just as good , if not better , than those places -lrb- plus the variety of a buffet is nice -rrb- . <sssss> i will be back here for sure !
?		what happened flo 's ? <sssss> i have been coming to flo 's for many years , even had my sister in law 's baby shower there -lrb- which was great and affordable ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i was in the shopping center today and decided to pick up some of their delicious wonton soup for dinner , as i have a bit of a cold , and i always liked their pork wontons , the delicious julienned ginger and carrots , the spinach , the shaved garlic ... perfection for wonton soup . <sssss> i got home and opened the soup ... what is this ?!?!?! <sssss> it was like the generic wonton soup you get at any take out place or from the frozen aisle . <sssss> it had thick cut carrots and 3 peas , but no other veg , no scallions , no ginger , no garlic . <sssss> the wontons were like shrimp balls ... i do n't like shrimp and was expecting pork . <sssss> this soup was not even a shadow of what i have had here before and was not good . <sssss> i am so disappointed . <sssss> i do n't know if this is due to it being take out -lrb- which would be ridiculous -rrb- or if they ran out of their normal soup -lrb- slightly better -rrb- or they changed their soup completely to this bland garbage -lrb- worst case scenario -rrb- . <sssss> i was thoroughly disappointed and wo n't come back soon .
?		i went here for lunch today and it was a solid three star , but has the potential to be a 4-5 star place . <sssss> the place was pretty empty at lunch and my friend and i were seated right away . <sssss> we ordered a bunch of things to share . <sssss> here is my complaint number one : we ordered the dan dan noodles , potstickers , eggplant , and sesame pancakes ... i asked the waitress if this was enough food for the two of us and she said no , the apps were very small ... and we ordered some wonton soup . <sssss> well this was ridiculous , we had enough food for 4 people , i do n't know what she was talking about ! <sssss> i guess it gave us an opportunity to try a lot of things . <sssss> anyway , we received the dan dan noodles first . <sssss> i thought they were a 3 star , ok , but nothing super special . <sssss> they had a nice mild spiciness . <sssss> i probably would n't get them again . <sssss> then we got the wonton soup . <sssss> the soup was pretty par for the course as far as wonton soups go . <sssss> another 3 star dish . <sssss> next we got the potstickers and those were a definite 1-2 star item ... they were like the frozen potstickers you get from trader joes . <sssss> that is always such a disappointment . <sssss> after that we got the yu xiang eggplant and that was a 5 star dish . <sssss> the eggplant was very soft and had a good texture and it was extremely flavorful . <sssss> i was happy we got it , but at this point we were realizing the huge amount of food that we ordered . <sssss> so finally we get the sesame pancakes and those are probably a 4 star , they were good , but not the best i have ever had . <sssss> i am sure that this place has more gems like the eggplant , and that i would need to come back to try some other things that would maybe bump up the rating for this place . <sssss> here is my second complaint : the service was awkward and slow . <sssss> we sat around with the food sitting out for about 30 minutes before having to call someone over -lrb- who was just standing there looking at us -rrb- to ask for a box . <sssss> then again we waited for another 10 min or so to get our check . <sssss> in the mean time , the girls who work there were just standing there or walking by our table to another one of the 3 tables that were full in the restaurant . <sssss> also , it kind of looks like people live in the back of this restaurant , there were couches , a tv , people just hanging out behind a partition . <sssss> finally , they left the doors to the place wide open letting in a massive amount of flies that bothered us throughout the meal ... i do n't love having flies all over my food and one actually died in my friend 's noodles and she had to pick it out ... yikes . <sssss> i would give this place another shot , but , i have to say , i was n't thoroughly impressed today .
?		claim jumper is one of those chain restaurants that gives you giant portion sizes , but the food really is n't anything to rave about . <sssss> i went here with a few friends last saturday after we had our comprehensive exam and it was just alright . <sssss> i really wanted to order a soup and salad , but that lunch special is only offered on weekdays -lrb- which is weird ... people do n't want to eat something lighter on the weekends ? <sssss> hmmm -rrb- and in order to get soup and salad , even ordering the smallest portion sizes would have been around 13 $ -lrb- which is ridiculous -rrb- . <sssss> so i ended up ordering the tomato flatbread appetizer and a cup of the potato soup . <sssss> the flatbread was fine , nothing to get too excited about , but not bad . <sssss> it had sundried tomatoes on the top and was a little garlicky . <sssss> the soup , on the other hand , was not good . <sssss> it was the weirdest tasting potato soup i have ever had . <sssss> it had carrots in it and it just tasted almost sour . <sssss> it started to separate -lrb- i could see the cream and the grease -rrb- before i stopped eating it about halfway through . <sssss> my friends got sliders and sandwiches , which i guess is the way to go here because they said it was fine , i just wish they had some half portion options or smaller salad/soup options for more reasonable prices for the kind of restaurant this is ... a national chain .
?		this has got to be the best chinese in phoenix . <sssss> the food is always fast and fresh . <sssss> the servers are always attentive and friendly . <sssss> this place is just great to go to . <sssss> i normally get the chicken chow mein and my bf gets the sweet and sour chicken and both are excellent . <sssss> the sweet and sour chicken is n't one of those gross fried puffballs covered in sugar , it 's a real chicken breast , fried crispy and sliced . <sssss> it makes such a difference . <sssss> i have been coming here for years and my waiter ed -lrb- who is n't there much anymore -rrb- always remembered us and knew what we wanted to order from memory . <sssss> now that 's good service .
?		this place reminds me of seattle . <sssss> the coffee is very good and the decor is nice and feels like a ` real ' coffee house , not a starbucks -lrb- ugh -rrb- . <sssss> i also like how it looks like it is going to be so small from the outside and when you walk in it is quite large with plenty of seating . <sssss> i have been here a few times and the coffee is always good and the service is also good . <sssss> the people who work here seem to know about coffee .
?		i went here today for lunch with my dad , my brother , niece , nephew , and their cousin . <sssss> there were some definite pros and cons to this restaurant . <sssss> pros : good caesar salad cute kid 's menu , little wax toys for them to play with , and cute sectioned plates with a good serving of tasty food ... really nice for kids the green chile burger was tasty ... not ` crazy ' good , but good . <sssss> they have a very nice patio which is great for beautiful days like today cons : valet parking ... really unnecessary their soup of the day was not very good ... a pork posole ... it did not have a ton of flavor and was not hearty enough ... the prices are a bit high overall , i liked it and would come back , but they could make some improvements .
?		yay ! <sssss> nypd is some pretty good stuff . <sssss> i 've been going to nypd since i was a kid , but the one in scottsdale . <sssss> so now that i live on the east side , i go to this nypd . <sssss> i had a coupon for a free ten inch pizza -lrb- thanks to fb and my trivia knowledge -rrb- and went to redeem it a couple days ago , and the pizza was good , as always . <sssss> we just got a pepperoni pizza , and it was good . <sssss> i have had many different combinations of toppings and they are always flavorful and fresh . <sssss> like getting pepperoni , ricotta , and basil ... so good ... but soo bad . <sssss> their pizza sauce is really flavorful and their crust is usually just firm enough , but not crispy . <sssss> also , they have amazing spinach artichoke dip , and now that they let you get a half order ... it 's actually affordable to get -lrb- which may be a bad thing , health wise -rrb- . <sssss> the dip comes with pizza crust bread with cheese on top ... so good , the whole order is like a meal for two . <sssss> last time we went in , however , the pizza crust bread was a little less cooked than i like , usually it is stable , so you can pick up the dip with the bread and not need a spoon , but the other day , it was kind of floppy ... so that was sad , but normally it 's fine . <sssss> overall , this is a solid place to get pizza . <sssss> i feel like there are better pizza places in the valley , but this place is really good and generally more convenient .
?		i went to the daily dose today for breakfast and honestly did n't think much of it . <sssss> i got the egg sandwich on a bagel and it was one of the most boring least delicious egg sandwiches i have ever had . <sssss> anyone who knows me knows that i love a good egg sandwich . <sssss> i think a good egg sandwich is simple and lets the ingredients speak for themselves . <sssss> this was not like that . <sssss> it was on a bagel , which i thought was too much bread for a good bread to filling ratio , it had cold mealy tomatoes on it . <sssss> the tomatoes made the entire dish cold quickly . <sssss> i took them off . <sssss> overall , this sandwich was just not what i like in an egg sandwich ... maybe others will like it , but i just did n't think it had that simple deliciousness that i expect in an egg sandwich . <sssss> also , the sandwich came with some potatoes that were pretty standard and some fruit that was just ok . <sssss> the bf got the pb & j waffle . <sssss> this was good , but also on the cold side . <sssss> the pb was on top , but was n't melty like you would want on top of a waffle . <sssss> the waffle was a bit soggy , and though it did taste like a pb & j sandwich i 'm not sure why you would pay 10 $ to have something that tastes like a 1 $ or less sandwich you can make at home . <sssss> our bill was 30 $ ... there is no way this food is worth that much money . <sssss> i will say , the service was good and the manager came by a couple times , so that was nice . <sssss> despite the good service , the mediocre food and high prices combined with the wealth of good breakfast places in the downtown and midtown areas will keep me from returning to daily dose .
?		mmmmm ice cream sandwich . <sssss> this dessert is really great because it 's really two desserts . <sssss> i like that ... a lot . <sssss> so i went here this afternoon for ` dinner ' and got the vietnamese coffee ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies ... so good . <sssss> it was a little salty and sweet and coffee - y. . <sssss> . <sssss> what more could i ask for . <sssss> the bf got peanut butter ice cream with snickerdoodles ... also very very tasty . <sssss> the thing is , the ice cream was n't blow your mind awesome and the flavors were pretty ho hum ... i would definitely come back here if i were in the neighborhood , but i probably would n't make a special trip again .
?		i still think that this place is a glorified cheesecake factory -lrb- because it is -rrb- but i have been here a few times since my last review and must say that a lot of their food really is tasty -lrb- much tastier than cheesecake factory -rrb- , so i have to give them that . <sssss> i went for lunch yesterday with my mom and i got the pasta and salad -lrb- like i do -rrb- and their salad is just super flavorful ... i love their dressing . <sssss> the pasta is good , nothing super special , but good and enough for two meals . <sssss> my mom got the pastrami sliders ... i do n't like pastrami usually , but these were actually good and she loved them . <sssss> additionally , i have been to the one in vegas and all of the food there was good too like the jambalaya ... really tasty . <sssss> so definitely a good place to get lunch ... i still stand by my thought that dinner is too expensive and i would like the option to get a small portion for less money -lrb- 3 chicken breasts per plate ... who could eat that ? <sssss> -rrb- .
?		ok , as much as i want to give this place 5 stars ... i just ca n't . <sssss> the wait is just too ridiculous . <sssss> so i think this place plays psychological tricks on it 's patrons . <sssss> people have to wait so long that they either go get drunk or get so hungry that the food tastes amazing once you finally get it ... plus people need to justify the wait . <sssss> but alas , i have fallen for their tricks . <sssss> we got there at 4:45 and had to park in the garage which has validation , but not complete validation , it still costs 5 $ -lrb- lame ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> we found the restaurant by looking for a mob of people . <sssss> we got in the 30 min line to put our name on the waiting list ... whoa . <sssss> when we got up to the front we found out the wait would be 3.5 hours , but at least we did n't have to stay the whole time . <sssss> i think that is the best possible thing this business has done . <sssss> if i had to sit there for 3 hours , i would not have been a happy camper , but we went to body world and came back and only had to wait 15 min , so that was great . <sssss> also our wait was n't really 3.5 hours , it was more like 2 hours 45 min . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> so we got some drinks at the bar and then got called in to a table . <sssss> the waitress was nice and very apologetic about the wait , so at least this restaurant knows to be courteous to it 's customers unlike a different restaurant i recently went to * cough * postino * cough * there were four of us and we ordered two appetizers and two pizzas . <sssss> we got the roasted veggies with cheese and sopprasetta -lrb- sp ? <sssss> -rrb- and the fontina wrapped in prosciutto . <sssss> they were both amazing !! <sssss> this was the best part of the meal . <sssss> the veggies included purple cauliflower , carrots , squash , asparagus , sunchokes , and olives . <sssss> they were sooo good . <sssss> roasted and kind of sweet . <sssss> these were some of the best veggies i have had . <sssss> also the cheese , i do n't remember what kind it was , was so creamy ... it tasted great on bread . <sssss> however , nothing touched the fontina wrapped in prosciutto . <sssss> i have not had prosciutto before because i do n't like bacon . <sssss> yes , i do n't like bacon . <sssss> but i was being so closed minded because prosciutto is delicious . <sssss> and this was especially good , it could have only been better if there were more of it . <sssss> the bf and i ordered the biancoverde and our friends got the wiseguy . <sssss> i did n't try theirs , but our was very good . <sssss> it was garlicky , but the flavor was more subtle than it usually is . <sssss> the three cheeses were great and the arugula tasted very fresh . <sssss> so the problems include : long wait and no dessert . <sssss> why does n't this place have dessert ? <sssss> -lrb- oh except for biscotti ... biscotti is a weak dessert choice -rrb- . <sssss> the rest was good and if someone were to invite me to go back , i would , but i probably would n't go back on my own .
?		i went to this location of in n out last night aaaaat about 1:30 am . <sssss> yes , i had had some beverages . <sssss> that alone should have made this experience extra delicious ... but it was n't . <sssss> there was a long line , understandable . <sssss> when we got our food -lrb- i got a cheeseburger animal style , bf got a double double -rrb- it was n't up to my expectations for in n out . <sssss> the bun did n't have that little bit of crispness that i 've experienced at other locations , the tomato was mealy , and they skimped on the onions . <sssss> next time i have had some beverages and am craving in n out -lrb- which is a seldom occurrence -rrb- i might keep driving to the mesa location , which i have had better experiences at .
?		ok . <sssss> so i went to the boa bistro a few months back and thought it was really not so good , but my dad wanted to go to caffe boa today and insisted that it was good , so i begrudgingly agreed . <sssss> we got there at lunch time and we were the only people there . <sssss> so the service was a lot better at this location than the other , however we were the only people there so ... we looked at the menu , and i just really wonder about some of their choices with ingredient combos ... some things just do n't taste good together , and those things seam to make up the majority of this place 's menu . <sssss> but anyway , we decided to split the caeser salad and the turkey sandwich . <sssss> the salad was a little wilted and was not super exciting . <sssss> the turkey sandwich was really good . <sssss> it had tomatoes , greens , some pesto - y sauce ... yum . <sssss> so this is why i gave it three stars ... still not a place i would go to regularly -lrb- especially after trying two of their not good pastas ... yuck -rrb- , but the sandwich was good , so there may be hope yet .
?		i went to this bar last night with some friends and it was alright . <sssss> we got there early , like around 9 , and got a table on the patio . <sssss> the drinks were decent , and my friends ' drinks were really cheap -lrb- it was extended happy hour unbeknownst to me -rrb- , so i ordered amaretto sours and they were 8 $ a piece -lrb- not on hh -rrb- , so that sucked a whole lot for me . <sssss> i guess you live and you learn . <sssss> so about halfway through our time there , our waitress switched the area she was serving , so we cashed out and got a new waitress . <sssss> the new waitress was atrocious . <sssss> i think she may have come by once in over an hour . <sssss> we could n't order more drinks and we could n't pay and leave . <sssss> eventually , we had to go up to the bar to try to pay so we could get out of there . <sssss> it was ridiculous . <sssss> also , the music was good at first , but then got switched to a bunch of covers of songs all by the same people -lrb- and i did n't see a live band , but it may as well have been -rrb- so it got a little old and annoying and it 's not a great place to dance . <sssss> on a good note , the bar on the inside is pretty cute looking and the drinks tasted fairly good . <sssss> i would think about going back , but definitely to start the night , not to end it .
?		this place is pretty tasty ... i went here tonight with the bf and another couple after wanting to go for months . <sssss> . <sssss> months ! <sssss> and it still did n't disappoint , so that 's how you know it 's good . <sssss> we started with some drinks , i had a peach bellini , which was good , the bf had a manhattan , and he said it was very good , i thought it was good too , but i have n't had one before , so i do n't know how it compares . <sssss> we had the bruschetta , which was pretty good , but could have been better with some balsamic i think . <sssss> the real star is , of course , the pizza . <sssss> the bf and i split the fried pizza ... wow ! <sssss> what a brilliant idea ! <sssss> it was like pizza inside a light fluffy doughnut . <sssss> plus , the mozz they use is wonderful and so are the tomatoes ... very good . <sssss> the other couple had a pizza with prosciutto on it and a pizza with roasted veggies -lrb- ca n't remember the names ... -rrb- . <sssss> i did n't try the veggie , but it smelled very fresh and delicious like bell pepper . <sssss> i tried the prosciutto and it was very good , and they did n't skimp on it either ... this pizza was covered . <sssss> it was pretty tasty . <sssss> i would say that it is not the best pizza in phoenix ... but it is good and worth a return visit . <sssss> we finished with the tiramisu , which ended up not being great , but not being bad . <sssss> so i would definitely go back and get the pizza ... i would also like to try the salad , as the ones i saw looked really good . <sssss> so yay pomo ! <sssss> way to make tasty pizza !
?		update : chef chris is awesome . <sssss> he not only sent me a message late last night , but he called me this morning to personally apologize , talk with me about the experience , and insist i take a refund -lrb- which i did not want to take because there were a lot of positives about the experience that i thought were valuable -rrb- . <sssss> he really made me feel good about our experience and it is so rare for a person to be so mindful of his consumer and take the time to personally talk for ten minutes to make the situation right . <sssss> that is very cool and makes me want to give this place another shot . <sssss> review : i was trying to decide between two and three stars because we went here for our fancy anniversary dinner and i really really wanted to love this place ! <sssss> unfortunately , it was disappointing . <sssss> i 'll start with the positive stuff , because there were lots of positives - 1 . <sssss> chef chris was super nice and friendly 2 . <sssss> i love the environment , we sat on the patio and it was beautiful . <sssss> the tables were candlelit , there was a pretty fountain , and i loved the little wood burning fireplaces and the nice smell that the wood gave off 3 . <sssss> a lot of the food was good . <sssss> we started with a very tasty minestrone soup with home made crackers and the dessert -lrb- pumpkin cheesecake -rrb- was also wonderful ! <sssss> i also liked that they put mint in the water and the coffee was very good . <sssss> so now on to the not so great parts ... so first , we had tried to go to this restaurant for my birthday in april , but a couple days before our reservation , the bf got a call saying that chef chris had fallen ill and that we would not be able to have dinner there but that they would call us as soon as he came back to give us a reservation then . <sssss> well , i waited a month after my birthday ... no birthday dinner ... cuz all i wanted was to go here . <sssss> no call . <sssss> the bf called and left several messages with no response . <sssss> then the message changed and they were closed for the summer and we went somewhere else . <sssss> that was pretty bad . <sssss> so now we got a res for our anniversary , and i was super excited but things went so wrong . <sssss> the main dish was not at all impressive . <sssss> i was told that one entree was chicken in a creamy sauce with black rice and spinach and i ordered that . <sssss> the bf got a beef tenderloin with pesto , potato , and spinach . <sssss> well ... they came out and my chicken and his steak were identical ... both with pesto , spinach , grilled potato . <sssss> that irked me a little bit , but i just figured that it was an honest mistake on the waiter 's part . <sssss> then i took a bite of chicken and it had a gelatinous texture ... i have never experienced that before , but i thought maybe it was just so juicy and i have never had chicken prepared in the same way before ... wrong . <sssss> then i took another bite and the texture was just weird . <sssss> i tried to see if it was pink inside , but we only had the candlelight so i could n't tell . <sssss> had the bf try it , and he said he thought it was underdone . <sssss> not a real awesome thing for chicken . <sssss> so i sent it back and the waitress was very nice , apologized and took it . <sssss> chef chris brought the new one out a few minutes later and was very sweet about it , which i appreciated . <sssss> however , the chicken was not so awesome . <sssss> maybe i was just turned off to it or something ... but it was n't very appetizing . <sssss> anyway , it was kind of bland and the sides were not great ... plain potatoes and raw spinach and tomato ... nothing special , and definitely nothing worth the price . <sssss> the bf 's steak was chewy but still better than the chicken , but essentially they tasted the same . <sssss> the worst part , though , was unfortunately the service . <sssss> i would understand the service being lackluster if chef chris were doing it all himself , but with two people on waitstaff and only about 15 tables it was unacceptable . <sssss> we were there for 2.5 hours , which would be fine if that was the intent of the restaurant . <sssss> . <sssss> but i do n't think it was . <sssss> the first two courses were timely , but dessert was kind of a mess . <sssss> we got some coffee ... cute large coffee cups , but not too much coffee in them and it was n't hot , but it was tasty . <sssss> we finished the coffee before we got our dessert . <sssss> the waiter told us he 'd bring some more coffee -lrb- us and the people next to us too -rrb- he came back a minimum of 3 times without refilling our coffee , probably more . <sssss> i do n't know if it was because there was a big table inside to tend to , but we did not get coffee until about 10 minutes after we finished our dessert and i had eaten slowly on purpose because i wanted to have coffee with dessert . <sssss> then we proceeded to get the wrong check twice -lrb- with about ten minutes in between wrong checks -rrb- and wait about 35 minutes to get the correct check . <sssss> there was some confusion between the waiter and waitress on who was supposed to take care of us , but it was a bit ridiculous . <sssss> for 100 $ for two people there are many places that have attentive service and tastier food . <sssss> so for all of these reasons , i do not foresee us returning to this restaurant in the near future , unfortunately , because there really are some great aspects of this place
?		my mom and i decided to have a girls day today , starting with massages and ending with indian food on a whim . <sssss> my mom said that she hated indian food , but then it came out that the last time she had had it was 20 years ago , so we decided to give it a shot . <sssss> the place is dark and a little run down , but once you get past that it is a decent place . <sssss> we split the chicken tikka masala thali with garlic naan and a mango lassi . <sssss> the drink was really tasty and my mom loved it ! <sssss> the chicken was good , but it was n't as good as i have had it other places and it was n't that spicy . <sssss> the sauces that came with it were all pretty good . <sssss> for dessert it came with a little fried donut thing that was sorta chemically tasting ... not my fave . <sssss> overall , the place was good , it just did n't measure up to other places i have tried but it did change my mom 's opinion on indian food , which is awesome !
?		i came here twice in the last few weeks , the first just for drinks and the second for drinks and happy hour food . <sssss> the drinks here are solid and happy hour is good . <sssss> their marg was pretty standard , but at only 4 $ on special , i liked it a lot . <sssss> their sangria is fairly tasty , sweet , but good . <sssss> the food , however , was not good . <sssss> the first trip we saw the food and it looked delish , but upon eating it , not so much . <sssss> we shared the chicken quesadilla , very bland and boring ... not awesome . <sssss> the service is generally good and they have electronic trivia -lrb- woohoo ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i would go back for happy hour drinks , but skip the food .
?		i went here last weekend with the bf 's parents to see if we would like to have our rehearsal dinner here . <sssss> when we first walked in , i was n't 100 % convinced because this place is old school ... like what i remember a sizzler or something looking like in the 90 's . <sssss> the place is dark and it has an old school salad bar ... need i say more ? <sssss> but this place really surprised me with their excellent service and food . <sssss> we started with apps -lrb- which is totally unnecessary because the portions here are out of control -rrb- . <sssss> we had the spinach dip and the potato skins ... it was good , but typical bar food . <sssss> i also had a couple mimosas because they were on special for 1 $ ... heck yes ! <sssss> we then got our soup/salad bar . <sssss> i had the soup and it was good , nothing terribly special , but not bad . <sssss> then the -lrb- humongous -rrb- entrees ... i had the lamb chops and they were delicious ! <sssss> they were perfectly cooked and seasoned ... super juicy , they reminded me of eating lamb chops at home as a kid ... definitely delicious . <sssss> the bf had the new york strip which was equally good . <sssss> he got it medium well , and they managed to keep it moist and juicy ... awesome ! <sssss> we all got twice baked potatoes with our meals , which were very good -lrb- how can potato and cheese and bacon and whatnot be bad ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> we finished with mud pie , which was ok , but nothing special . <sssss> anyway , at the end of the meal -lrb- while i was sitting there dying of stuffedosity -rrb- the owner came over and spent the time to chat with us about how our party was going to be set up and what the room would look like . <sssss> i liked how friendly and accommodating the owner was . <sssss> we are planning to have our rehearsal dinner , so i will update after that ! <sssss> definitely check this hidden treasure out !
?		i 've been to tammie coe a couple times as i live fairly close to this location . <sssss> they have some pretty delish baked goods ... i 've tried the crack cake -lrb- chocolate and mocha deliciousness -rrb- , red velvet cupcake -lrb- cream cheesy frosting of wonderfullness ... but hard to eat due to the top being larger than the base and all of the sprinkles -rrb- , ooey gooey cupcake -lrb- ummm yum ! <sssss> -rrb- , and the brownie -lrb- just ok ... way too much frosting -rrb- . <sssss> overall , i do n't think this is the most delicious dessert in town , but it is very good and i would -lrb- obviously -rrb- go back .
?		the bf and i went back here last night because he felt like a burger and it was 9 o clock and we did n't want fast food , so this place came to mind , despite the fact that it is far away from home . <sssss> i was so impressed because our waiter , casey , remembered us from the last time we were in and even remembered what was on special the night we came in ... it was kind of crazy , but i think it is so cool that a place like this has such good service . <sssss> it was definitely unexpected . <sssss> the bf got the burger again and he really loves it . <sssss> he gets it with havarti cheese ... it is good . <sssss> i got a different special which was a flatbread with chicken , bbq sauce , onion , bacon , cheese , and red jalapenos on it . <sssss> this thing was good ! <sssss> it was spicy and sweet , which is a great combination , and the crust was very crispy , which gave it a nice texture . <sssss> i also like that the bacon was there just to support the other flavors , it was n't all about the bacon . <sssss> i am not a bacon fan -lrb- despite being called crazy for this fact -rrb- , so when i can eat something that just has a slight bacon flavor , that is perfect for me . <sssss> the portions were large and the prices are pretty close to standard . <sssss> again , i would return ... this place has really impressed me .
?		i went here the other day with some friends for lunch . <sssss> i got the chicken teriyaki bento box , which was actually a great deal . <sssss> for 8 $ i got miso soup , salad , spring roll , one gyoza , rice , chicken , and veggies . <sssss> whoa . <sssss> now it was n't all the best food ever , but it was ok . <sssss> the soup was just alright , the salad was n't as good as the last time i had it , but it was still good . <sssss> the spring roll was probably the best thing ... it was perfectly fried and the veggies in it tasted good unlike most spring rolls out there . <sssss> the chicken was a little bland . <sssss> overall , this place is alright , nothing awesome but not bad .
?		since my previous review i have been to short leash several times and each time it is just wonderful ! <sssss> i recommend trying their specials from week to week ... they are often way better than their standard menu items . <sssss> the food here is great , but the more impressive thing is the service ! <sssss> the owners of the truck are friendly and genuine people . <sssss> who would n't like this place ??!!?! <sssss> well ... obviously no one , look at the reviews .
?		i went to rehab tonight to celebrate my last day of work for the school year ! <sssss> also , we had a yelp deal ... so that was cool too . <sssss> the atmosphere is very casual , that i like . <sssss> i got a frozen margarita and oh my goodness it was boozy . <sssss> as i am writing this , i am still tipsy from that single beverage ... wow . <sssss> for dinner i had the hangover burger on a pretzel roll ... it was delish ! <sssss> the burger was perfectly cooked and it had egg , cheese , and bacon on it ... how could it be bad ? <sssss> it was super delicious . <sssss> the sweet tots were just ok , but the bf 's fries were really tasty . <sssss> he also liked his turkey club . <sssss> the service was prompt and friendly by our nice server pickle . <sssss> anyway , i will most definitely be back and next time i will get a pot brownie : - d
?		wow . <sssss> just wow . <sssss> why have n't i gone to this place before now ? <sssss> am i crazy ? <sssss> so i went there last night for my birthday with the bf and it was wonderful ! <sssss> we got there at around 9 due to my having class until late at night , but they were just as pleasant to us as if we got there at a normal dining time , and we got a parking spot , which was great . <sssss> first of all , bottles of wine with no corkage fee from their grocery . <sssss> what ?!?! <sssss> what ! <sssss> yes . <sssss> it 's true . <sssss> we had a bottle of wine at a restaurant for 15 $ . <sssss> that 's like a glass and a half of wine at postino . <sssss> this was too awesome . <sssss> that alone is enough to make me want to go back . <sssss> so on to food , we ordered their special salad for the night which was a caprese . <sssss> this stuff was good . <sssss> it had house made mozz on the bottom , then ricotta , then a whole roasted tomato , then the perfect amount of sea salt -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- , some kind of salt and pepper , delicious balsamic , and strips of basil . <sssss> this was so good . <sssss> i was so happy we decided to get it , i only wish we kept the plate so i could have dipped my pizza crust in the balsamic ... yum . <sssss> then we got the roasted corn pizza . <sssss> this was also very good . <sssss> the corn on the pizza tasted really sweet and delicious and it was the perfect counter to the goat cheese . <sssss> the crust was also very good and the whole thing tasted fresh . <sssss> we finished with the red velvet cake . <sssss> at first , i was n't a fan , but as i ate it , it got increasingly good . <sssss> it is more subtle than a lot of cake out there , but that is a good thing ! <sssss> also , our waitress was super sweet and helpful . <sssss> she helped us pick out all of our food , and she was spot on . <sssss> i will definitely be back here soon .
?		this place was hopping at lunch time last friday ! <sssss> the restaurant is really nice looking , with a lot of natural sunlight . <sssss> i went with my dad and we split the chicken flat bread and the braised beef sandwich with the quinoa side salad . <sssss> it was a lot of food ! <sssss> we ended up taking half of it home . <sssss> anyway , i thought the sandwich was good , but could have used some veg or something on it so it was n't just meat and bread . <sssss> in addition , the flatbread was good , but could have used more flavor too ! <sssss> it has really delicious caramelized onions , which gave it the majority of its flavor , but it could have had more seasoning or a sauce of sort ... the quinoa salad was really good , i would definitely eat that again . <sssss> also , the service was very attentive , when my dad went to the bathroom , the server came over and refolded his napkin ... kind of weird , but nice i suppose . <sssss> overall , i thought it was good , my dad liked it more than i did , and i would like to try this restaurant again .
?		the bf and i decided to try something new and different for breakfast yesterday and as i looked on the yelp app , this place came up . <sssss> the bf was a little skeptical of going to vegetarian/vegan restaurant , but i convinced him because , generally , breakfast is vegetarian . <sssss> let me start by saying that this space is so cute ! <sssss> i love the old pictures on the wall , the green wall , the painting of mr. lucky 's , and the large window walls at the front of the restaurant . <sssss> i told the bf that this place could be picked up and put in seattle and not be out of place at all . <sssss> secondly , the service was great . <sssss> everyone was friendly and our waiter was on our coffee , which i appreciate . <sssss> i had the curry waffle and the eggplant bacon and the bf had the banana pancakes . <sssss> my waffle was good , different than anything i have ever had , but i was n't a huge fan of the eggplant ... it was seasoned a little bit on the heavy side for me , luckily , the waffle was plenty of food . <sssss> the bf 's pancakes were delish ... it had rum cinnamon bananas on it which were unreal . <sssss> i would definitely come back here for breakfast again ... i really want to try their biscuits and gravy because i do n't love sausage gravy and this place uses a poblano gravy with corn -lrb- or something like that -rrb- ... which sounds awesome , and who does n't love biscuits ? <sssss> when we went to pay , we could see one of the cooks/chefs making the biscuits fresh in the back ... so that 's pretty awesome too .
?		i went to pig and pickle tonight for one reason ... to get the veggie burger with bacon ... did i get that ? <sssss> nope ... when the bf and i got there , we realized it was happy hour and i could not resist 5 $ plates . <sssss> we asked the waitress what the best item on the happy hour menu was and she said the bahn mi ... i was skeptical because it had liver on it -lrb- eeeek -rrb- , but decided to try it . <sssss> it was actually fairly good ! <sssss> the pork was a little mushy and looked really gross , but the veggies added a good amount of flavor and crunch to the sandwich ... i could n't really taste the liver . <sssss> after eating half this sandwich , there was no way i could get the burger ... way too much food . <sssss> so the bf and i decided to share a couple more happy hour items including the tacos and the beer cheese dip -lrb- much healthier and lighter , right ? <sssss> ha . <sssss> -rrb- the taco was fairly disappointing because it had that same mushy pork on it with mushy refried beans and nothing crunchy to change the texture ... just mush ... not awesome . <sssss> the beer cheese was ok , but again , had kind of a weird texture ... it says it comes with things to dip in it which is 99 % bread ... not exactly what i expected . <sssss> overall , i just did n't think it was amazing , but i still want to give them another chance by trying a real meal here because i like that they use a lot of local ingredients and make a lot of their ingredients fresh -lrb- like bread and whatnot -rrb- .
?		i only got one thing here while at the airport this past christmas ... . <sssss> the red velvet cupcake . <sssss> and it was sooooo goood . <sssss> decadent . <sssss> cream cheesy . <sssss> fantasticness . <sssss> i want another red velvet cupcake right now * drool . <sssss> the place is set up very much like lgo in phoenix . <sssss> they have a lot of really good looking food in the small market and they also have burgers , pizzas , and sandwiches that all look amazing . <sssss> this is a definite must stop while in the airport !
?		simply awful . <sssss> we had heard a few people rave about this place , and now i wonder if they were dropped as a baby or how they got this brain damage . <sssss> the `` cheese '' is this awful petroleum grease product with yellow color . <sssss> that was the worst of it , but nothing was good at all . <sssss> and crazy price to boot .
?		had a really great lunch here . <sssss> the place was really busy , but service was still pretty fast . <sssss> the food portions are gigantic and you ca n't leave this place hungry . <sssss> prices are in line with the quality and huge portions . <sssss> the fried chicken is excellent , as was the cheese and grits .
?		this place was just fantastic all around . <sssss> the service was fast and very friendly . <sssss> we chatted with the baristas and servers for a bit , and they really know their coffee and products . <sssss> i had a double macchiato that was prepared perfectly , and the coffee was so sweet on its own that i did n't want any added sugar . <sssss> their blt has a soft egg on it , making for a very tasty sandwich that i keep thinking about . <sssss> my wife had some sort of caramel pastry that seemed to be made of lightly cooked cookie dough with a huge slab of caramel in the middle . <sssss> it was simply stunning .
?		good quality , tasty , and generous portions .
?		we went here for dinner tonight because it was arizona restaurant week and they had a special menu . <sssss> they were offering an appetizer , entree , and dessert for $ 29 a person . <sssss> unlike other restaurants , the items on this special menu were some of the same on their regular menu and really represented an outstanding value . <sssss> we both had the yucatan shrimp coctail . <sssss> one would have been enough to share but we each had eight very large , succulent , and very tasty shrimps . <sssss> i had the mahi-mahi tacos , which were excellent and the other person with me , had the dr. pepper shortribs , which were tasty but a bit too fatty and heavy . <sssss> dessert was pretty good but we could barely eat it since we were stuffed . <sssss> if there was one shortcoming , the food came out too quickly . <sssss> i noticed it was the same for all the other tables as well . <sssss> the appetizer came out right away and before i know it , the entree comes out . <sssss> slow it down ! <sssss> it seemed like just a few minutes after we finished the entree , the desert came out . <sssss> needless to say , i felt the dining experience was too rushed . <sssss> also , when we arrived , the dining room was virtually empty so i am not sure why they seated us and the 4 other groups of people who came in afterwards all in the back room . <sssss> it was a bit odd , being in this room full with other people and seeing the main dining area , which in my opinion was much nicer being empty . <sssss> the staff however were all very gracious and friendly and as the food was really very good , i would definitely return again .
?		seeing all the cars parked in their parking lot and as it was time for lunch , i decided to give it a try . <sssss> the staff was very efficient . <sssss> i think i waited a whole 10 minutes to get my food . <sssss> i ordered the mongolian beef . <sssss> the sauce was too sweet and the meat-well it reminded me of mystery meat . <sssss> not a very memorable meal .
?		i 've downgraded ted 's unfortunately . <sssss> in the many times i have gone back , when i have had the footlong , every time i 've been disappointed . <sssss> i remember it tasting better . <sssss> i think it just tastes funky . <sssss> i do n't know if they do n't cook it enough . <sssss> i also have had the white hot dog made of veal - that was forgettable . <sssss> i 'm sticking to the all beef . <sssss> cheese fries are still awesome however .
?		i ran in here to get some jasmine rice , beef pho seasoning and a refill of jubes nata de coco yesterday . <sssss> i was disappointed to discover that they only had coconut flavored jubes , no mango or strawberry ones but that 's okay , my toddler devoured them within minutes anyway . <sssss> they 're delicious and so fun to eat !! <sssss> the store was more crowded than i had ever seen which is great for them . <sssss> also my cashier was very friendly , and despite how crowded the store was , there was zero wait to check out . <sssss> the total damage for my stuff was about $ 16 , which was n't too bad for the size bag of jasmine rice that i got . <sssss> there was a vendor selling chinese pancakes for -lrb- i think -rrb- 75 cents each , right at the front of the store , and i 've never had one so i would have been curious to try one , but i was too pressed for time to wait and only noticed it as i was leaving . <sssss> maybe i 'll get a chance to try it next time ! <sssss> ps : and i finally noticed the signs over the store aisles are printed in english on one side and chinese on the other side . <sssss> i definitely did n't notice that in my last review ... -lrb- doh ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		i brought my six year old son and 20 month old daughter here for a , much needed , sugary pick me up after i took them to the phoenix art museum and we had a great time . <sssss> the place was still sporting christmas décor in their traditional pink and black colors and it was very , very cute . <sssss> we had the same server that we had the last time we visited and she was just as sweet and efficient this visit . <sssss> we sat on the patio since the weather was so nice and we ordered a glass of lemonade for me , a chocolate milkshake for my son and a small banana sundae for us to share . <sssss> the sundae was wonderful and it came with a scoop each of vanilla , strawberry and chocolate ice cream , plus strawberry , pineapple and hot fudge toppings , and all smothered with whipped cream and a cherry on top . <sssss> an optional nut topping is served on the side for those with allergies . <sssss> our total damage was about $ 17 , including a tip . <sssss> this is a great little place and i love visiting with my kidlets !
?		our family loves 5 & diner . <sssss> i have two little boys who are 5 and 7 and they get so excited to go to 5 & diner and put quarters in the miniature jukebox at the table and wear the paper 5 & diner caps they get with their color-on menu and crayons . <sssss> i love the service and the ambience . <sssss> it 's easy to imagine i 'm transported back to the 1950 's when my own parents were in high school and times seemed simpler ... even though i doubt they were actually any simpler . <sssss> i remember coming to 5 & diner in the wee hours of the night after my friends and i left the nightclubs back in the early 1990 's . <sssss> we 'd sit in the booth wearing our black leather jackets and fashionable club attire , and pound down cigarettes -lrb- you could still smoke in there then , but not now ... thank goodness -rrb- and drink cup after cup of hot coffee while devouring plates of strawberry covered waffles and heaps of bacon . <sssss> -lrb- those were the days . <sssss> -rrb- anyway , i took the family last weekend and was surprised that they recently changed their menu and the dinner entree i was looking forward to ordering was gone . <sssss> -lrb- major bummer . <sssss> -rrb- it looked like they changed the whole menu since my last visit and i 'm still not sure i love the new menu , it 'll take a couple of more visits before i have a verdict on that ... i know for sure if they got rid of their eggs benedict i 'll be scarred for life ! <sssss> you need to go to 5 & diner if you are into nostalgia , it 's a wonderful place with great service that makes me wistful for a time that came and went a full 20 years before i was even born . <sssss> now lets just see if the new menu sucks or not ...
?		this place is a jam packed , hardcore candy warehouse . <sssss> it 's not cutsey and it does n't have playful little candy displays , but they have almost any candy you can imagine or remember from your days past . <sssss> racks , bins and shelves stacked with taffies , moonpies , chocolates galore , novelty candies , candy sticks , jelly beans , bubble gums , pinwheel suckers , malted candies , sugar free stuff , gummie thingies , wax lips , licorice whips , etc. . <sssss> you having a candy bar at your wedding or party ? <sssss> you are gon na wan na come here first , just trust me on this . <sssss> the prices are fair and the staff is very nice and they offer a punch card to customers for repeat visits . <sssss> score ! <sssss> this * is * candy mecca and i honestly make a sacred pilgrimage here at least once a year .
?		this is my gym . <sssss> it 's expensive as hell , but worth it . <sssss> the workout and water facilities are top notch and they have several of everything , so there really is n't any wait , but what really sets lifetime apart in my book is the locker rooms . <sssss> their locker rooms are fabulous and second to none . <sssss> they offer free , clean towels as you walk in and the locker rooms have numerous changing bays -lrb- and some private changing cubbies -rrb- with polished granite , stainless steel , stained wood surfaces everywhere . <sssss> all the lockers have built in locks , that lock with your membership card . <sssss> although i 'll add that i am apparently too retarded to understand * exactly * how to make the lock work with my membership card . <sssss> they also offer a side lounge with a flat panel tv and leather couches . <sssss> there is a separate room with all the toilet stalls , and for reasons i wo n't spell out here , the door between the locker room area and the toilets is a good thing . <sssss> plus there are generously sized showers with self-serve , wall mounted body soap/shampoo , a wonderful , mentholated steam room , a digital scale and even a swimsuit water spinner . <sssss> there is even tanning bed access , if you 're into that kind of thing . <sssss> i ca n't speak any more highly of the locker rooms at lifetime , the only other gym that comes close is mountainside , but they do n't compare when it comes to other gym amenities .
?		i did it , i broke my solemn vow ... i braved the self-absorbed yuppies and the tanned and coiffed mommies in $ 100 lulu lemon yoga pants who 've never broken a genuine sweat in their lives -lrb- bikram yoga does n't count , bitches ! <sssss> -rrb- and i went into whole foods with my husband and toddler . <sssss> previously i 'd publically vowed that i would n't be caught dead in there . <sssss> well , curiosity got the best of me and not surprisingly it was packed elbow to elbow with other curious shoppers . <sssss> but oh my glob , it was dazzling !! <sssss> i was drawn in by the siren song of a bakery case filled with desserts too pretty to eat and prices high enough to deter you if you decided they were pretty enough to eat after all , and a salad and prepared foods section too varied and ginormous to describe , and a seafood and meats section across one wall , beckoning us with thick cut bacon , and exotic fishes and beautiful , marbled cuts of meat . <sssss> and the cheese section ? <sssss> the mind boggles . <sssss> it was all too much ! <sssss> i 'm not exactly a bona fide gourmand so when the very helpful employee behind the seafood counter cheerfully offered me a free sample of the prepared seaweed salad i politely accepted it and took a tiny bite , immediately regretting it and wishing there was a discreet trash can where i could spit the green , slimy , masticated glob of seaweed out of my mouth . <sssss> i gritted my teeth and swallowed . <sssss> -lrb- and yes , in case you were wondering , it was exactly like that kind of a swallow . <sssss> -rrb- finally , i spied a package of vanilla , small bakery made whoopie pies over in the bakery area . <sssss> unhealthy , fattening and uniquely american : it speaks my language ! <sssss> in addition to the whoopie pies we also picked up some french cookies from the bakery , two small boxes of pasta salads from the salad/cold food bar , and a bottle of house wine on special ; a sour and dry moscato , that tasted nothing like any moscato i 've ever had and i hated it , immensely . <sssss> our total bill was about $ 50 for the 5 items , and we carried out our lone , little grocery bag with $ 50 worth of groceries to our car . <sssss> looking around the parking lot it appeared that we really were out of our element sporting a pro-life bumper sticker on one side of the back window , and the thrash rivet band ; ministry bumper sticker on the other side , in a sea of prius ' with obama '12 bumper stickers , and subarus with world wildlife foundation stickers and ski racks . <sssss> clearly , we are not their signature clientele . <sssss> would i go back ? <sssss> probably . <sssss> this is definitely the place to get that hard to come by ingredient for a special recipe . <sssss> but i 'd only venture back with a bigger wad of money and healthy dose of cynicism for the image whole food 's target demographic puts off about their ` healthy ' lifestyle in mind , body and spirit . <sssss> * snorts heartily * oh and remember those whoopie pies i bought at this veritable mecca of health food ??? <sssss> they ended up being the most unhealthy , butter dripping , sugary deliciousness i 've eaten since i was a carefree little kid with a stomach of iron . <sssss> in fact they were so disgustingly delicious that i could only tolerate a sliced off quarter of one per day , otherwise i literally felt queasy . <sssss> bravo , whole foods , it appears we are not so dissimilar after all !
?		i came here again for groceries with my teenage daughter this weekend since i received a $ 10 off of a $ 50 purchase coupon in the mail . <sssss> -lrb- yes ! <sssss> -rrb- it 's a bit of a drive for me to get up here since i live nearer downtown phoenix , but i think it 's worth the drive if i go once a month or so . <sssss> firstly , i 'll begin this review with perhaps my only criticism of the store and that is that there is n't an apparent plastic bag recycling box at the front of the store like there are at so many other grocery stores . <sssss> i just assumed there would be one and was caught off guard when i walked up there with my used bags and i could n't find one . <sssss> oh well ... so , anyway i was once again , dazzled by the enormous selection of various goods . <sssss> their selection in each department -lrb- including bulk goods -rrb- is so big that it 's like a grocery store on steroids . <sssss> and once again the prices were fabulous . <sssss> also , a new thing for me this time was the presence of some very friendly employees stationed around the store offering samples of the different goods that the store had on sale that day . <sssss> my daughter and i sampled their whole wheat french bread and a garlic butter spread , a new type of cold cereal from post , some toasted flat bread , some crab cakes , and finally some progresso brand clam chowder . <sssss> it was nice . <sssss> the checkout process was efficient and the cashier was friendly and fast . <sssss> he applied my $ 10 off of $ 50 coupon , then he asked me how many of my own bags i had brought so that he could credit my grocery bill for it . <sssss> i do n't know exactly how much credit you get for each reusable bag , but it 's still awesome . <sssss> my daughter bagged our groceries and before i knew it we were ready to leave . <sssss> -lrb- and you say child labor like it 's a bad thing ... -rrb- we got out of there with a cart stuffed to the brim with fresh produce , tons of meat , four gallons of milk and a dozen yogurts , several loaves of bread , plus a bunch of name brand grocery items -lrb- including two big bags of cat and dog food -rrb- for just about $ 120 . <sssss> in comparison , i estimate i would have spent about $ 150 for all that food at a competing grocery store . <sssss> score !
?		dear tempe marketplace , this is the most upsetting place i can think of in my immediate vicinity . <sssss> if i ever commit suicide , it will be here . <sssss> you really are an easy target , are n't you ? <sssss> your `` authentic '' restaurants of every variety are n't fooling anyone . <sssss> do n't get me started on the unwalkable parking lot that i 'm forced to traverse in order to hit target and the coffee bean in the same trip . <sssss> and for fuck 's sake , stop playing '90s top 40 songs in the parking lot . <sssss> at earsplitting levels . <sssss> if i wanted to listen to matchbox 20 , i 'd do it at home , alone , in total shame , like a normal person . <sssss> waste of space , waste of resources , waste of time . <sssss> but i 'll totally be back next week when i need tp or want to see a movie , k ? <sssss> see you then ! <sssss> sara
?		five stars . <sssss> why ? <sssss> because it 's damn near impossible to get a decent espresso pull in tempe , and this place does it . <sssss> plus , it 's close to my house -lrb- in phoenix terms , at least -rrb- and to me , that counts for a lot . <sssss> did i mention that the owners are really , really , really , really nice ? <sssss> really . <sssss> nice . <sssss> and they care about their coffee in a way i have n't seen since i left oregon -lrb- shout out to stumptown in pdx and full city in the euge -rrb- . <sssss> the coffee is freshly roasted -- from cafe cortez here in town -- and the atmosphere makes you forget you 're in a strip mall -lrb- not a bad strip mall , but still -rrb- . <sssss> please , please , please go here . <sssss> give them your money . <sssss> they deserve it , and you 'll be a better person for it . <sssss> promise .
?		an asian grocery the size of a wal-mart is pretty awe-inspiring all by itself , but there 's really much , much more to lee lee than aisles of noodles and spices and lentils and rices -lrb- though they do have these as well , in spades , as well as all the requisite weird seafood and meat products that make asian groceries so damn fun -rrb- . <sssss> there 's so much happening at lee lee , i go into a daze every time i enter . <sssss> seriously , my boyfriend has to herd me around , lest i spend 45 minutes choosing frozen indian breads . <sssss> -lrb- paratha ? <sssss> naan ? <sssss> batura ? <sssss> roti ? <sssss> garlic , onion or plain ? <sssss> -rrb- or trying to justify purchasing five pounds of lamb . <sssss> or considering the merits of roast duck . <sssss> anyway , before i get sidetracked again , let 's start where i always do -- the booze aisle . <sssss> lee lee carries a wide variety of asian beers , of course , plus some good sakes and plum wines . <sssss> but there 's always at least one too-good-to-be-true booze selection . <sssss> yesterday it was a half case of widmer hefeweizen for $ 6.88 . <sssss> i 've also purchased konig ludwig bavarian weissbier for $ 2.99 a six-pack , carlsberg elephant beer for $ 9.99 a case , warsteiner mini-kegs for $ 7.99 and countless other delights at `` fell off a truck somewhere '' prices . <sssss> if that 's not enough to get you to brave lee lee 's jacked-up parking lot and hordes of chattering families of all ethnicities -lrb- united only by an uncanny ability to get in your way -rrb- , consider this : lee lee is also home to aisles of non-asian delights , like jamaican jerk sauce and mexican spices . <sssss> and of course , my favorite -- the lovingly labeled `` holland foods '' section . <sssss> i do n't . <sssss> know why it 's there , but i do know that pickled herring is fucking delicious . <sssss> by the time i leave , my cart invariably looks like the shopping list for a dinner party at the united nations . <sssss> a very drunken dinner party .
?		probably the best 500 calorie salad i have ever had ... the bbq chicken salad is an illusion how they make this salad for only 440 calories is insane . <sssss> . <sssss> i will be eating this salad four times a week , my wifes quail was so rich with the whipped sweet potatoes at only 375 ... ridiculous ! <sssss> the food and service are 5 stars , but the atmosphere feels quite corporate and forced , the live piano bar in the lounge is kind of creepy . <sssss> . <sssss> just my two cents . <sssss> . <sssss> but if you are looking to shed a few pounds . <sssss> . <sssss> seasons 52 would have to be on you rotation list with true food , blue burrito , china lite , and the chili at wendy 's : -rrb-
?		local , unpretentious , clean , friendly , reasonable prices . <sssss> . <sssss> always fast , friendly efficient service , the pasta here makes you wonder how olive garden stays in business . <sssss> . <sssss> -lrb- the crack infused into the bread sticks . <sssss> . <sssss> -rrb- great seafood dishes for under 15 bucks . <sssss> . <sssss> and the best 6.99 crab cake on the planet . <sssss> . <sssss> btw jan e. aint lying . <sssss> . <sssss> pasta giovanni ... go get sum of dhat . <sssss> . <sssss> when chicken and pigs have intercoarse . <sssss> . <sssss> this is what happens . <sssss> .
?		our own little version of the smithsonian in north phoenix . <sssss> the quality of the exhibits and the amount of different instruments mim has is daunting . <sssss> this is one of the most impressive collections of music anything i have ever scene . <sssss> a must for anyone who appreciates music , very educating , but fun and exciting at the same time . <sssss> it is probably the best $ 15 dollar ticket in the city .
?		love the original los dos ! <sssss> they have solid food and good service . <sssss> this place is always very busy and noisy inside the restaurant . <sssss> definitely not a place for a quiet dinner out . <sssss> i make it here a couple times a year and it is always fantastic . <sssss> love the carnitas and salsa !
?		love it ! <sssss> the espresso is great and i love that i can get almond milk lattes ! <sssss> sometimes they have vegan gluten-free desserts , which is an added bonus . <sssss> this place is always crowded , but that is just part of the deal . <sssss> highly recommended !
?		so the awesome food truck came to a fixed abode at the old cheuvront location . <sssss> i am in heaven - no longer have to wander around the valley trying to remember what days/times they 're supposed to be where . <sssss> and it 's only a few blocks from home . <sssss> thank you downtown phoenix and especially thank you pizza people pub !
?		we got christmas dinner here for an excellent price ; the mashed potatoes were delicious , the cranberry whatever was very good , turkey eminently serviceable and allowed me to make my own gravy . <sssss> why are commercially prepared gravies always so horrid ? <sssss> otherwise , i 've taken to getting their whole beans as an ` offprice ' alternative to the micro roasters around town .
?		the only thing wrong with this place is : no dessert menu . <sssss> o wait ... that 's next door ...
?		four for dinner on a first friday - this is the third restaurant in a building with three and the only one not on the street - it shows . <sssss> sens and turf had people spilling out of them - pasta bar was half full at best - an inadvertent lucky break - they had only one waitperson - who did a creditable job in my opinion . <sssss> insalata caprese , braised greens , desert sweet shrimp , pasta carbonara , ricotta cheese gnocchi and a pasta with fennel sausage . <sssss> i have n't had such good carbonara since i lived in queens -lsb- nyc -rsb- . <sssss> all well worth the price and the waitperson delivered them timely . <sssss> however , i remain skeptical about their survival - not enough traffic on what should be a blowout night - and wonder if they 'll share the fate of palette .
?		i am horrified it took me so long to review this - it took me a few months to track down chris porter 's new place last year . <sssss> having found it , i took my wife there for her birthday in early january , 2010 . <sssss> not the extravaganza of the old tapino . <sssss> but the gastronomic delights did n't diminish in the slightest . <sssss> the old homestead is perfectly suited to the simpler menu . <sssss> to paraphrase a hannibal lecter line -lsb- another gastronome , come to think of it -rsb- , our world is a richer place for chris porter 's continued presence in it .
?		... as always , 5 stars if the place would stand up anywhere . <sssss> it would . <sssss> firstly , i 'm overjoyed it survived these past few years . <sssss> secondly , on a regular saturday night 8:30 - ish , it was 40 % full - and in-line with it 's 2 street-facing co-tenants . <sssss> that 's hopefully enough to ensure survival . <sssss> these 3 delightful restaurant/bars have carved out a wonderful second life for the industrial building they 're housed in and provide a luxury of urbanity to this burg . <sssss> we had to scoot in for a quick small supper before going to a comedy show a friend was in . <sssss> small check quickly and un-resentfully served - thank you gracious server ! <sssss> there was a single man drinking a coke and eating a bowl of pasta at the bar while diligently reading his book . <sssss> it was clear he felt abundantly welcomed . <sssss> that tableau epitomizes the civilized urbane establishment this place is . <sssss> the pasta carbonara remains true after two years to the unremittingly high standard set for me by a queens neighborhood italian joint decades ago - and pasta bar remains the only other place i 've ever ordered it more than once . <sssss> for that , and so much more , i 'm eternally grateful .
?		i went for lunch on a weekend recently . <sssss> kimchi pancakes , spicy pork bbq lunch special . <sssss> the seasoning on the pork bbq was n't what it used to be . <sssss> it seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland . <sssss> the sauce is probably watered down . <sssss> it lost the yummy sauce / flavor / seasoning it used to have . <sssss> the kimchi pancakes were n't that great either . <sssss> i used to be so loyal to this place but after being let down the past couple times , i think i might as well just cook at home -lrb- and deal with the dishes later -rrb-
?		nice mall-scape . <sssss> i like sitting outside near the fireplace on the sofas during the winter and read books . <sssss> the kids go krazy @ the in-ground water fountains , which is pretty annoying sometimes . <sssss> not a huge variety of stores . <sssss> i got my wallet stolen at this mall at the food court yard outdoors so * watch your stuff * while you 're chilling / reading . <sssss> oh , a couple toddlers were throwing rocks at trees and hit me , and they started cracking up . <sssss> their mothers were too busy talking to even notice . <sssss> darn those lazy b * tches and their brats ! <sssss> tsk tsk bad parenting . <sssss> the restaurants are meh . <sssss> i like * some * stuff from rubio 's but thats about all .
?		pretty darn good pork bbq sandwich . <sssss> good service . <sssss> laid back fun atmosphere . <sssss> i went for a late dinner on a weekday night . <sssss> was spacey , not crowded at all , and food was relatively quick . <sssss> parking is kinda tricky to figure out at first
?		i went here for a buddy 's bday party . <sssss> the sandwich one of us ordered was huge . <sssss> the clam chowder was kind of small but very fresh and tasty . <sssss> sirloin steak was small but decent . <sssss> mashed potatos were yummy . <sssss> so were the veggies . <sssss> food came out warm and in a fairly timely manner considering that it was a sunday night . <sssss> my crusted chicken creamy marinara pasta -lrb- w / extra marinara on the side -rrb- was excellent . <sssss> i do n't eat huge portions so it was just right . <sssss> i did n't need a to go box . <sssss> the manager seemed very nice . <sssss> desserts did n't interest me at this place , but the main course was tasty . <sssss> i would go again .
?		good outdoor mall when the weather is nice . <sssss> i go here for ra happy hour sometimes . <sssss> however , i found a huge roach chilling near the fountain area on the stone step / bench area . <sssss> well , duh its an outdoor mall ... but still , i refuse to get along with roaches . <sssss> that one experience was disgusting and kind of freaked me out thus i 'm hesitant to go back .
?		i had better . <sssss> takes way too long , and this place went downhill in quality and service over the last 3 years .
?		really hit or miss . <sssss> one day there was nothing but crap , another day , i found a gorgeous formal gown with some beading and threading flaws for 11 bucks ! <sssss> i fixed it up and hemmed it for 30 bucks and now its a top tier prom gown . <sssss> i also found a variety of size 4 shoes on different occasions . <sssss> being a super petite size , its difficult to find my size , but this store has it for women with itty bitty feet . <sssss> heels , wedges , you name it . <sssss> downside : some of the merchandise is dirty , damaged , or ugly , merchandise display is messy , but if you look hard enough you 'll find something for a steal on a lucky day . <sssss> downside : lines are long , no returns , crowded on weekends , challenging to find parking .
?		we use bertha 's at work for lunch catering and they are always on time , affordable and delicious . <sssss> i always make sure to order myself an additional sandwich/salad combo when they deliver . <sssss> so to start , bertha 's is fantastic . <sssss> some of my favorite sandwiches : roasted turkey pesto chicken roast beef and blue cheese chicken curry their harvest salad and thai chicken salads are also fantastic . <sssss> i 'm a fan !
?		i really want to give zpizza 4 stars , but it 's just not a 4-star pizzeria . <sssss> their veggie pizza is the best out of any ` delivery ' i 've had but does n't rival cibo or even sauce . <sssss> the upside : good veggie/vegan options . <sssss> - you can opt for the whole wheat crust for no extra charge -lrb- the gluten-free crust is a $ 3-4 upcharge -rrb- . <sssss> - their california veggie and moroccan eggplant pesto pizza are divine . <sssss> - there 's an ice cream parlor next door . <sssss> - their iced tea is n't awful . <sssss> the downside : the service . <sssss> - we always order and pick up -- and are consistently on hold for more than 5 minutes , often times having to call back because they hung up . <sssss> - there are a few people working at this location who clearly hate their jobs . <sssss> their attitude and manner is really unpleasant to be around . <sssss> i get it , you work at a pizza place and you 're not that happy ... but why take it out on the customers ? <sssss> i came in the other night and watched a guy stand in line in front of me for about 8 minutes -lrb- he was already there when i arrived -rrb- , while the girl at the front was on the phone . <sssss> there 's another register . <sssss> . <sssss> yet no one came up to help him . <sssss> he ordered slices and by the time i told them what i was picking up , added a slice and got my drinks , he was still waiting . <sssss> this poor guy waited 20 minutes just to get 2 slices of pizza that was already premade and in the case ! <sssss> that 's just careless service .
?		i was so excited for green to finally open a location -- right across the street from my house . <sssss> everything i 've tried , i loved . <sssss> their `` burgers '' are delish -lrb- try the mexicali , green burger , spicy ` g ' -rrb- , the rice/noodle bowls -lrb- drunken mushroom , mongolian , curry bowl , earlobe pasta -rrb- are awesome and their fresh-made limeade and lemonade and basilade are to die for . <sssss> i brought my mom and 13 year old brother here , and they were satisfied . <sssss> you ever tried feeding a picky 13-year-old ? <sssss> he loved the spicy ` g ' sandwich . <sssss> oh , and do n't forget to try one of their pizzas . <sssss> yay . <sssss> and now , they sell daiya cheese for the veggie/vegans -- which is really convenient since many places do n't have it . <sssss> five stars !
?		this is my favorite new place in the downtown/uptown phoenix area . <sssss> everything about the ambiance is rad . <sssss> this place gets packed on most evenings , so you may expect a wait time . <sssss> their veggie board is ridiculously good . <sssss> it would be a great meal on its own . <sssss> if you 're there with a party of two , i 'd suggest ordering that and splitting a pizza . <sssss> their gemini pizza with potatoes and fennel is so good . <sssss> i 'm usually reserved about potatoes on a pizza , but this one hits the spot . <sssss> we 've been here a few times and have tried the brussels sprout pizza -lrb- i 'm vegetarian so no pancetta on half of it . <sssss> . <sssss> and i have to admit , i think it would have balanced the taste -rrb- . <sssss> their funghi sandwich is really good and the ravioli was delicious . <sssss> they have these homemade wine coolers and tons of beer on tap . <sssss> okay , i 'm a fan . <sssss> no , really . <sssss> i love this place .
?		i do n't know how much worse this place can be . <sssss> i tried the happy valley location with an awful experience a year ago and decided to give mellow mushroom another chance when they had a groupon . <sssss> bad idea . <sssss> the first incident of this meal was getting a dirty water glass . <sssss> this was n't just ` dirty , ' it was caked with food on the bottom . <sssss> i did n't notice for a second . <sssss> . <sssss> there was food floating in my water . <sssss> . <sssss> and when i took a closer look , the bottom of the glass had dough or some sort of sauce sitting there looking back at me . <sssss> our server did n't seem surprised and did n't apologize . <sssss> i guess this happens all the time ? <sssss> i asked for my water in a to-go cup . <sssss> we waited over 30min on a wednesday evening to get our small pizza and sandwich -- with less than half the restaurant full . <sssss> our waiter was nowhere to be found for water refills . <sssss> i ordered a small mega-veggie pizza and my boyfriend ordered their steak and cheese hoagie . <sssss> this was probably the worst veggie pizza i 've ever had . <sssss> there 's something off about the dough and it 's greasy as hell . <sssss> i had more cheese on my pizza than veggies -lrb- and the taste of the veggies was weird -- like one of the vegetable toppings was starting to go bad -rrb- . <sssss> and tofu on this pizza ? <sssss> it 's overkill and it 's not doing anyone any favors and i 'm sure it 's gmo soy . <sssss> his hoagie was okay , summing up his sandwich as `` giving me more than i need does n't make it better . '' <sssss> this sandwich was overflowing with meat . <sssss> i ate less than one slice and decided to box up the rest . <sssss> as we were walking out , i dumped my leftovers . <sssss> i 've never ever thrown away almost a whole pizza . <sssss> seriously -- how can you get it so wrong ? <sssss> bad food . <sssss> dirty glasses . <sssss> apathetic service . <sssss> the only redeeming quality ? <sssss> their beer draft selection .
?		i love video games and we had a d & b card that we purchased in hawaii while on our honeymoon . <sssss> we decided to see how much was left on the card and kill some time this afternoon . <sssss> turns out we had like 20 bucks left on it so we played a bunch of games . <sssss> we played some racing games , some skeeball , some basketball , air hockey etc. . <sssss> they even have this virtual reality ride/game thing . <sssss> 2 people sit in these reclining chairs , you pay your money , then you get to pick 6 scenarios to `` play '' . <sssss> we chose the spooky mine ride and some car racer game . <sssss> basically you sit back and watch this screen in front of you , all the while your chair moves , fans blow on you to simulate wind etc. . <sssss> it was pretty cool . <sssss> it kind of jerked you around in some parts though and my head was banging against the headrest . <sssss> i didnt like that aspect of it but other than that it was fine . <sssss> oh yeah ... i played a shitload of the claw games ... i am pretty good at them and love playing them . <sssss> i got 3 bears in uniform ... red sox , phillies and cavs , as well as a bowling pin looking animal for my dog chief to play with when we get back . <sssss> it was a solid dave and busters and we had fun while we were there .
?		still the greatest pizza out here in the west ! <sssss> my wife and i got a small garden salad , and our usual ... a large pepperoni and garlic pizza . <sssss> she had a glass of their new sangria and i had a pepsi . <sssss> total after tip was about $ 45.00 . <sssss> well worth it in my opinion . <sssss> simply the best pizza you can get outside of ny ... and even then , this will give any pizza joint in ny a run for its money .
?		i forgot to review my birthday lunch ... . <sssss> damn it anyways ! <sssss> i wanted to try some of mr. biancos offerings but did not want to wait 3 hours for pizza so we decided to come here . <sssss> i figured it would be my only trip here in quite some time so i decided to get 2 sandwiches . <sssss> i got the tomato , basil and mozarella . <sssss> and i also got the sopresetta and provlone with roasted peppers . <sssss> the sopresetta was one of the top 5 sandwiches i have ever had . <sssss> it was absolutely perfect . <sssss> not a whole lot of meat , but the flavor was super delicious ! <sssss> the roasted red peppers and sharp provolone blended well and it was on some amazing bread . <sssss> basically pizza crust . <sssss> so good ! <sssss> the tomato sandwich was meh . <sssss> im not the biggest fan of tomatos to begin with and when i tried i bite i knew why ; -- rrb - . <sssss> i picked them out and basically ate a mozarella sandwich . <sssss> this one got a little soggy too . <sssss> about 8 bucks each which was ok by me . <sssss> the candy they give you in the bag is a super small caramel . <sssss> it was good , but nothing to rave about . <sssss> one bite and it was dust . <sssss> if i ever come back to phoenix i will definitley stop by and get a sopresetta sandwich . <sssss> it was amazing !
?		still my favorite hot dogs . <sssss> we started the trip and ended the trip with meals at teds . <sssss> first visit - got there about 2pm on saturday afternoon . <sssss> i have never seen a line of more than 5-7 people here at teds . <sssss> we walked in and there was a line about 30 people deep . <sssss> i do n't know if everyone was getting their hot dog fix since they were closed on easter or what but it was busy ! <sssss> waited in line and placed my order for a footlong , polish , white hot and a corn dog . <sssss> -lrb- this trip , i was going to eat every hot dog they had ... veggie and kids hot dogs do n't count ; -- rrb - lol -rrb- washed it down with a loganberry shake . <sssss> my wife got some fries . <sssss> second visit - got there around 10:30 am and there were only 2 people in front of us . <sssss> today i placed my order for a bratwurst , italian , all beef and regular dog . <sssss> my wife got a hamburger and some onion rings . <sssss> washed it down with another loganberry shake . <sssss> in my opinion , this is the order of greatness of teds dogs/sausages . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> italian - my favorite . <sssss> spiced right and always delicious . <sssss> a must order every time ! <sssss> 2 . <sssss> bratwurst - close runner up to the italian . <sssss> a must order every time ! <sssss> 3 . <sssss> polish - another great sausage . <sssss> 4 . <sssss> regular dog - the classic . <sssss> 5 . <sssss> all beef dog - huge and beefy . <sssss> 6 . <sssss> white hot - wont get it again probably . <sssss> not enough flavor . <sssss> 7 . <sssss> corn dog - foster farms regular corn dog . <sssss> fried proper but plain . <sssss> i can make one like that myself at home . <sssss> 8 . <sssss> foot long - tastes different than the other dogs . <sssss> bun was stale , have not liked it the 2 times i ordered it . <sssss> wont ever get it again . <sssss> cant wait to go back . <sssss> the dogs are always delicious !
?		even after reading the reviews , i was still surprised by how nice the decor , how warm the service and how fucking delicious the lentil soup really is ! <sssss> needing sustenance fast , i had an exacting friend that knew his babaganoush and his hummus and i had some vegetarian and inexpensive critiera , so this place fit the bill exactly . <sssss> located in the same strip mall as the gold bar , parking was easy and the interior was intimate but still clean . <sssss> they really straddled the line between overdecoration and cleanlineness and airinees fit for a breezy lunch and won , which is quite a feat . <sssss> our server was friendly and not overbearing and we chose booth seating . <sssss> the menu is n't overwhelming but all the choices are solid . <sssss> we chose the mezza platter to get all the dips , and i chose the vegetarian mousaka since the eggplant had been raved about in another review . <sssss> i was stunned for under 7 bucks , the appetizer was huge and they really do not skimp on pita what-so-ever , we had a huge plate and had some left over at the end of dinner ! <sssss> warm , fresh , ... oh yeah . <sssss> the lentil soup is more of a red dal puree with a subtle sea salt taste without being too salty-it is a real winner with some short noodles and onion mixed in -lrb- and our soup came free with dinner -rrb- . <sssss> my plate of mousaka was huge with a large generious serving of rice and true to form , the eggplant was tender the sauce was thick tomato without tasting of being premade . <sssss> i ended up eating almost all of it when i really should 've saved half for lunch today -lrb- bummer -rrb- . <sssss> the only real downside was the drink selection was n't mind-blowing and i stuck to water . <sssss> i wished i had saved room for the baklava , but i will next time , in fact i am pretty happy i have a go to place for food before running errands on this side of town . <sssss> and def . <sssss> believe the hype about the lentil soup-they have it every day !

?		one star for : the company -lrb- meaning , my friends , not the elusive firm in the firm with tom `` scientology '' cruise -rrb- one star for : the cool fish in the fishtank lauren and i enjoyed . <sssss> if i could flush six down the toilet , i would . <sssss> i mean , i understand why kristin s. loves this place-it is so over the top and cheap for being so `` chi-chi '' , you just have to laugh and take it for what it is-a poseur . <sssss> well , the laughs end for a lot of reasons : 1 -rrb- mr. k , what the hell was wrong with the wait staff ? <sssss> and stevey was right-it was the worst billing experience i have had ever in my paying for a tab life . <sssss> no exaggeration . <sssss> it plummeted a shitty experience to the sewage system . <sssss> and they kept charging us for a fat tire they did n't even have in stock ! <sssss> 2 -rrb- you def . <sssss> needed to have ingested coke to `` enjoy '' the music . <sssss> 3 -rrb- the crowd was so sad . <sssss> 4 -rrb- i do n't have much more to add to this review . <sssss> i have given up hope on humanity ... but not on my tempe 12 girl calendar !!!!
?		this is a local arizona institution , so i am scared to give it 3 stars ... but dammit , this site is about honesty , right ? <sssss> my brother has tried to take me to an oregano 's for a while , but there is always an insane wait at whatever one we have attempted . <sssss> since it was an early weekday afternoon , i suggested this new one in mesa since there was bound not to be a wait-and we were right ! <sssss> we entered and this place is pretty spacious . <sssss> they asked if we wanted to eat at the bar-but to tell the truth it looked like on of the most unappealing bars i had ever seen . <sssss> it reminded me of the barbie 's mcdonald play set i had as a kid . <sssss> plastic-y and just kind of kitchy-and not in the good way . <sssss> no thanks . <sssss> we were led through the restaurant and i have to admit it reminded me of a pizza hut . <sssss> hmm ... we opted for outside but kind of regreted it since it was hot out and the misters did n't do much . <sssss> the table was kind of large and i felt like my bro and i were at a conference table waiting for a terribly important meeting . <sssss> the host was friendly and wanted our drink order kind of fast-but since it was my first time , i told him that . <sssss> he then proceeded to tell me all the drinks . <sssss> i mean all of them . <sssss> i wished i had kept my mouth shut and just found the last page of the menu that listed drinks , since he proceeded to list them off verbatim . <sssss> while he sat at our table . <sssss> kind of awkward . <sssss> am i being too east coast about this ? <sssss> after all that , got a fat tire and then proceeded to look over the menu . <sssss> as a vegetarian and lactose intolerant , going to italian restaurants is kind of dumb for me , i admit . <sssss> i mean i can eat pizza , but it just does n't bode well . <sssss> i settled for the pasta basta , penne with feta cheese , pine nuts , olives , sun-dried tomatoes , garlic , olive oil and with a slice of garlic bread . <sssss> it was a little spicy , but pretty tasty and not a bad deal for 8 bucks . <sssss> i had some left over and the garlic bread toasted well the day after . <sssss> i just was n't super impressed . <sssss> it was a good solid restaurant , one you could bring grandman , your ma , a study group , kids , whatever , which is nice , right ? <sssss> but i found the service to be way too familiar and way too friendly -lrb- which sounds crazy , and trust me , i didnt think that was possible until i went here -rrb- . <sssss> i understood finally why children are scared of clowns after coming here . <sssss> someone being overly nice and cheerful is just kind of eerie .
?		3 and a half stars i really like the large patio in the back-definitely an older and not as rowdy in the annoying brodawg screaming for no good-goddamn reason , but more bustling like friends come here to chill the fuck out . <sssss> the way a good pub should be . <sssss> however-my dining experiences and some day experiences in the past have not been great at all . <sssss> i found the bartenders lacking that extra mile , esp . <sssss> when there was hardly anyone in there and i was at the bar alone-in a real pub , that is an opportunity to chat a little bit . <sssss> i do n't mean i want to tell them my lifestory , but man ... its a bit awkward ! <sssss> also the veggie burger was lacking and became a mess all over my hands due to some mysterious fucking leaky ass sauce . <sssss> so i could n't recommend this place for a long while 'cause everytime i went , it left me disappointed and hollow . <sssss> it was also the worst poured guiness i had ever had , too . <sssss> but-the bartender out back was awesome and it is a good vibe -lrb- how hippy does that sound-damn , the west is changing me ! <sssss> -rrb- , really spacious , huge beers at reasonable prices .
?		so after experiencing a coming-of-age moment at chez nous , any bar was going to have a hard competing with `` smooth operator '' lounge singers ... but this place was def . <sssss> a ` good egg ' . <sssss> easy enough to find with the rude boy sign on east indian with parking on the street -lrb- the lot was full -rrb- , i ventured in and saw a smaller space packed with a young , diverse hipster/regular crowd . <sssss> a small well-lit bar to the right did n't take long to get our orders of high life and g & t -lrb- which was in a huge glass -rrb- . <sssss> there were n't any stools left -lrb- and it was a little cramped -rrb- , and there were these gorgeous white modern chairs arranged in a commune-living room pattern in the middle of the bar but something about the seats told me my shorty ass would sink into it and i would hear nothing anyone would say . <sssss> instead we headed over to the jukebox and pored over smiths , nouvelle vague , talking heads , etc-not a huge selection but a matter of quality over quantity . <sssss> behind the jukebox and the left/rear of shady 's was a large pool table then large booths against the wall -lrb- most circular-whoo-hoo ! <sssss> -rrb- that thankfully did n't have swamp-ass occur -lrb- a huge fear of mine -rrb- . <sssss> i have to say the bathroom was hard for me to find originally-i went towards the back of the bar and found myself looking stupidly on an open back door and had to ask two ladies seated at one of the high tables where it was-hidden all batman like next to the jukebox we spent like an hour deciding which songs to play ! <sssss> damn ... overall a classy hip little joint , just a little awkwardly set up and would like to go there again when it was n't so crowded . <sssss> update : i 'm givin this place 5 stars . <sssss> i came here early at 6 -lrb- pm not am -rrb- and the bartender put extra credit in the jukebox for me to play ! <sssss> everytime has been good , all the bartenders are fast and friendly , the clientele is relaxed and looking to enjoy a relaxed , cosy atmosphere . <sssss> and guy friends tell me it is the cleanest mens ' bathroom they have ever seen in their life -lrb- i saw it-it is immaculate -rrb- . <sssss> shady 's !!!
?		i had heard through many grapevines that the people loved my florist , and a quite bit were vegetarians and they would say , `` bonnie , you would love it '' . <sssss> after a long day walking around with my honey in phoenix , we wanted a nice , romantic place for some quality time before going away on a trip -lrb- and since i was heading to kenucky , `` land of deep fried cream cheese puffs '' , i wanted a good meal ! <sssss> -rrb- that would n't be terribly pricey . <sssss> it took a while for us to get into the parking lot , but once we did at around 7-ish on a wednesday night , we found parking pretty easily . <sssss> we entered into the doors and i was really stunned to find it far brighter and airy than i had assumed from people 's descriptions . <sssss> i had thought dim lighting , heavy curtains , plush chairs-this was definitely more of a lunch place - a nice lunch place mind you . <sssss> after browsing through the menu , i saw mostly sandwiches and not much a dairy-free veggie could eat-but i did see a yummy nicoise salad for about eleven bucks . <sssss> tim was super excited about all the healthy meat options , so we settled in . <sssss> i like the huge bar on the right and i kind of wanted to eat there but we decided one of the tables would be more `` couple-ly '' . <sssss> there were tons of people there ... wait , this is definitely where ladies come to lunch . <sssss> i look at the menu-a huge selection of salads . <sssss> figures . <sssss> since wine is half-off the bottle -lrb- which original prices are way high anyway -rrb- , we decided on a light pinot costing around $ 26 bucks that our very helpful server erica suggested for his roast beef sandwich and my salad since i hate white wine . <sssss> looking around more , we were the only male/female couple there ! <sssss> it was all ladies dining , or men on hot dates -lrb- or some boring ones-some life time partners just tiredly eating their salads -rrb- . <sssss> the women were wicked drunk on wine and giggling ! <sssss> lots of pearl necklace touching and smiling . <sssss> oh my . <sssss> i def . <sssss> saw a woman whose face at age 55 looked better than mine at 28 . <sssss> we got some willo bread , which i liked fine , but some toasting would have been better . <sssss> my salad came out and it was actually delcious . <sssss> i am starting to consider myself a nicoise expert , and while the seared ahi tuna is ususally what i like , the regular tuna was fine . <sssss> all the ingrediants were fresh and the salad was huge-i was glad i was really hungry when i ate-and i ate it all up . <sssss> the wine went perfectly with it and tim loved his food . <sssss> i found the service really friendly and funny and i was completely satisfied with my food . <sssss> our bill came out to under 50 , and we would have spent at least 40 at a sushi place , so i felt pretty good about it . <sssss> in fact , maybe the food and wine was too good since we got home ... and slept from feeling so full and warm . <sssss> oh-and i really have to say kudos to the pianist who was texting while she played piano-we tipped her well ! <sssss> so i am pretty surprised by all the less than stellar reviews . <sssss> i think we just had good luck with our food choices , wine , service , ambiance , parking , and value ? <sssss> or maybe mfc is reading these reviews . <sssss> i just ca n't eat a whole lot here , so my chances of coming here more than every few months are very diminished . <sssss> oh , and boys -lrb- and girls -rrb- who want a comfortable space for a date , tots give it a try .
?		god , you really ca n't beat the soy mocha here -lrb- i mean , i like lux a lot , but lux is in phoenix , i am here in tempe -rrb- . <sssss> i just wish they had two baristas cause that line gets really long sometimes . <sssss> i wish there was food here , but i kind of like no frills , just plain coffee vibe-and some table lighting would be awesome cause if the front door isnt open or the back garage shed thing isnt open , then its kinda dark to read in there .
?		what if you could walk down a hallway into your favourite liquor store , only to find a warm cave with chimay on tap and big screen television sets ? <sssss> what if i told you it was taste of tops ? <sssss> located next to thai basil and an antique shop in the plaza west of buffalo exchange on university , is basically a tempe version of the roosevelt in phoenix . <sssss> warm , earth toned , sepia sconses , wood flooring , coke dealer black leather couches , relax into a setting that feels a little bit like a furniture rental outlet and the coolest uncle 's basement rec room ever ! <sssss> our first night , we could n't lodge our bikes into the meager bike rack offerings and had to bike lock together , we entered into a large windowed storefront and settled into a corner booth , not sure if there was waiter staff or not . <sssss> the menu items were sparse , which was a bit of relief , and we ended up on hummus and salsa . <sssss> our seating was prime for people watching -lrb- hipster dates , beware of the giant tv blasting football ! <sssss> -rrb- , and i was beside myself for having dogfish head punkin ' ale on tap . <sssss> everyone settled into food , which i thought was fine , not disappointing , but hummus is a dish hard to fuck up , but also hard to really wow real hummus lovers . <sssss> tonight , i noticed the bright lights of the cooler offering the finest tops liquors selection towards the rear of the bar were just too bright-maybe some kind of dimmer lights , design , different doors are in order ? <sssss> i tried other beers on tap , all served in appropriate glasses , not overwhelmed with choices . <sssss> the clientele were mostly tattooed refuges from cornish pasty , older couples , random drunks , sporty bicycle groups , and well , us . <sssss> our manager asked us how the chips were -lrb- i told you , the salsa is damn good -rrb- , and we ended up with friends joining us for a cheese plate -lrb- gouda , brie , blue , goat with toast , dried fruit , nuts and olive oil -rrb- and more beer -lrb- although the wine selection did seem impressive -rrb- . <sssss> overall , the atmosphere is sophisticated , but shakers like , with not much pretense , simple seating , sconses , premier lighting , wooden details , no plants or shitty paintings . <sssss> the bathrooms are male/female lockable bathrooms that are huge and lovely -lrb- love to see that last -rrb- , i was able to blow away mr. k with the selection of tops with a being john malkovich like portal b/w taste and tops liquors proper . <sssss> the bar , round tables , coke den sofas , and booth seatings have accomodated all the crowds i have seen here nicely -lrb- although too many tighty whities and thongs on bar stools to my liking -rrb- . <sssss> the wait staff has been restrained and prompt , bills have been settled quickly , the manager judy that stopped by friendly , but not pushy . <sssss> i am so psyched for this place to succeed , i could just go for better food options , more bicycle parking , and better tv footage !
?		you have $ 20 , it is a beautiful day in phoenix , it is 11:30 and you want brunch ? <sssss> coronado cafe ? <sssss> yes . <sssss> a lazy saturday morning where palatte , over easy and matt 's big breakfast had been vetoed led us to this charming renovated house . <sssss> i immediately loved the set up of the out door patio and front porch . <sssss> the front counter was really quaint-little glass domes for scones and a tiny little glass done that housed one single pastry -lrb- ! <sssss> -rrb- in a dark wood . <sssss> we were led over to a four seater in the next room but with all of the sunshine coming in , there was no `` bad '' corner in the place . <sssss> brunch was conveniently placed on one page of the menu and was surprised to see tofu scramble listed as an option but decided to risk some dairy for the poached eggs with avocado and blue crab on foccaccia and roasted potatoes and split it with jared who got the scramble . <sssss> the other two diners got the traditional eggs benedict and liked it . <sssss> both of our shared dishes combined were delicious-mine was really savoury and filling and the tofu scramble with filled with great veggies . <sssss> some hiccups were the eggs dishes potatoes were dried up , but the tofu one had great plump potatoes ? <sssss> makes me think they did those dishes first and keep them warm for a while . <sssss> i asked for hot sauce twice and they served it in one little dish to me , even though everyone had nodded when i asked for it . <sssss> she offered whole wheat toast to the eggers , and then i found out it was an extra buck for the toast with jam-hmph . <sssss> even though the french pressed coffee looked great , i wanted tea and no liquer-and they did n't have a very good selection . <sssss> in fact our waitress seemed almost confused by my request-she unearthed some peppermint tea , but it was pretty commercial . <sssss> it was served in a great single server mug/teapot combo though ! <sssss> overall , i was totally full but not in a grossed out way and i paid around 16 , 17 bucks for my share -lrb- including tip and tax and for sharing some of the drink cost -rrb- . <sssss> it was a great menu and i really enjoyed the ambiance and the service , despite the hiccups and i really want to try the seattle dutch baby pancakes with fruit-yummers ! <sssss> *** update 1/31/09 **** had the seattle dutch baby and it was even better than it looks-simply amazing , does n't need maple syrup , incredible texture , not overtly sweet , and worth sharing . <sssss> also had a pomosa , the pomegranate of the mimosa variety that was dry and refeshing . <sssss> coffee was a huge french press , which i was surprised by since i was the only one having coffee and i thought they had little french coffee presses ? <sssss> and at 7 bucks , that was a steep two cups of coffee ! <sssss> make sure to specify how many people are having the coffee is my advise , no biggie . <sssss> friendly , fast , relaxed service .
?		a final stop for last call after enjoying a late night tapas , i was surprised by how small this place is compared to the other lounges/bars in oversized spaces arizona . <sssss> i found it instantly comforting instead of cramped quickly . <sssss> you have a hostess area right when you enter . <sssss> i checked out the lounge to the right and it had about three or four major seating areas along with some tables-but the people sitting there looked way comfortable and they were n't about to leave anytime soon . <sssss> we went to the left and there were high tables and stools set up . <sssss> along the wall were large cushioned backs for loungers on the plush cushion . <sssss> i opted for the stool and it was surprisingly fine-most stools for shorties make me feel weird since my feet are dangling . <sssss> the rest of the space had more high tables and then a smaller bar area with stools . <sssss> there was plenty of seating , and while it was n't packed , everyone there looked like they were with friends or established dates and totally relaxed having drinks-i did n't feel any meat market here . <sssss> i was disappointed by the wine by the glass selection -lrb- not the highest caliber-hence the minus start -rrb- so i stuck with the martini selection . <sssss> most ` tinis do n't go under 7.50 but they also do n't go over 10-pretty reasonable . <sssss> the waiter was very down to earth and told me the truth about buying cigarettes-that the bar down the street would have them and be like 7.50-no thanks ! <sssss> so mad props to him for the low down . <sssss> we got the summer peach , the s'mores , afternoon delight , and raspberry '' '' -lrb- blanking out on drink name-sorry ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> they fill their drinks to the brim and they are pretty damn strong . <sssss> the peach one was refreshing and not overtly sweet-much like a belletini . <sssss> the raspberry was like a popsicle ... an adult popsicle-a bit too sweet for me but had real raspberries on the bottom . <sssss> the afternoon was a personal favourite of mine-citrusy but not too sweet , i 'll def . <sssss> get this drink next time . <sssss> the s'mores was out of control-graham cracker crust ? <sssss> an actual marshmellow in it ? <sssss> whoa . <sssss> it was delcious for a sip , but not sure i could get a whole one of those thangs ... overall , the vibe is very relaxed , clubby but not in your face and def . <sssss> not a meat-market . <sssss> i ca n't really describe the furniture since it was pretty dark and it did n't offend me in any way-it just blended in with the background which is what a good lounge should do when you are enjoying drinks with friends ...
?		disclaimer : i 've known steve -lrb- the owner -rrb- for a few years and he 's a great guy . <sssss> disclaimer : i 'm also a coffee dork and even though i know steve and he 's a great guy i would n't pull punches if the place was n't up to par ! <sssss> disclaimer : i think i 'm addicted to disclaimers now ... this place has great coffee , a great space , and a great attitude . <sssss> steve roasts his own coffee and is very passionate about the quality of the beans he 's producing . <sssss> if you catch him there , ask him about it at your own risk . <sssss> you will get a lot of great info . <sssss> there is a lot of thought in their menu , though it may not be apparent at first . <sssss> for example , there are no blended drinks -lrb- like frappucinos -rrb- not because steve is a coffee snob , but because the blenders make a lot of noise and he wants people to be able to relax and work without being disturbed . <sssss> their space is very flexible with several couches , tables , and chairs for a casual conversation or to get some work done . <sssss> the coffee menu is also fairly simple , encouraging discussion between employees and customers if there is something specific they want . <sssss> the staff is very accommodating , and willing to help or explain . <sssss> they have a nice set of food menu items to accompany the drinking portion of things . <sssss> it 's a very well rounded , very great addition to the local coffee scene ! <sssss> disclaimer : this is the last disclaimer .
?		since moving nearby to la grande orange , i 've lamented the amount of money i 've spent at that most tasty place . <sssss> now that i 've finally made it to postino , my lamentations will only grow . <sssss> yeah , it 's wonderful . <sssss> carla greeted me at the door , chipper as only a saturday night can create , and gave me a quick tour upon hearing it was my first time . <sssss> she handed me off to maya , who was also supremely patient with my many questions and general ignorance of wine . <sssss> yeah , i 'm not a wine snob . <sssss> i have little patience for sniffing and swirling . <sssss> i 've good wines and bad wines , but i 'm fairly convinced anyone talking about the boquet of light oak with a strong raspberry melon finish is making it up or part of a cult . <sssss> did n't matter , though . <sssss> maya recommended a fantastic wine , and between her and carla i sorted out which of their famous bruschetta i was going to try -lrb- proscutto + fig , salmon + capers , tomato jam + goat cheese , apple + brie -rrb- . <sssss> the garage doors were open and the weather was fantastic . <sssss> loved the decor , loved the staff , loved the food , and loved the ... what 's that other stuff they served . <sssss> . <sssss> , oh yeah , the wine . <sssss> -lrb- sigh -rrb- between this place and lgo it may be cheaper for me to just move again further away .
?		they say love hurts . <sssss> i love fnb , and the place hurts me . <sssss> trying it on the recommendation of many friends , we snuck into the counter on late notice to give it a try . <sssss> we had to try the appetizers , right ? <sssss> oh , and they were so good not a scrap survived . <sssss> our main course - same problem . <sssss> stuffed , whimpering , we saw them trot out the desserts . <sssss> oh no , no ... but we had to try them , right ? <sssss> moaning , aching , we waddled out of fnb stuffed to the top with good f and b . <sssss> if our poor bellies survive , i hope they toughen up as we want to put them through the challenge again !
?		a hidden away place i 'd heard about but not yet had the tasty pleasure of visiting . <sssss> thanks two huge fans who live nearby , i finally corrected this oversight . <sssss> split a bowl of their tasty chorizo stuffed dates as an appetizer , which was a mistake . <sssss> not the dates , the splitting . <sssss> these are `` get your own dates '' sort of dates , and i suggest trying them all by your lonesome . <sssss> went on a wednesday so the vovo special was fish & chips . <sssss> it was quite tasty , but i think i would have rather tried some of the mac & cheese i 've heard so much about , or one of their other dishes . <sssss> but i 'll quite likely be returning , so not a problem at all to remedy .
?		i love this eclectic place . <sssss> i can grab some tasty food , meet someone for a coffee , or shop some great local products . <sssss> the staff has always been helpful when i 've had any questions , and i 'm hoping they continue to thrive downtown !
?		we do n't eat here because we were shopping at the mall . <sssss> we shop in the mall because we eat at nordstrom café . <sssss> it is that good ! <sssss> they deliver delicious food , top notch service and great flavor with such ease that it makes you wonder why most other restaurants do n't get it right ? <sssss> . <sssss> after all , it 's still a departmental store , right ? <sssss> their first priority must be getting their merchandise right , not food . <sssss> yet , it 's right up there in the list of best places to eat in town . <sssss> i realized that when the food is good , your personal preferences take a back seat . <sssss> when i am here , it 's no longer a ravioli versus angel hair debate in my head . <sssss> i will have both . <sssss> one this week , the other next . <sssss> i suggest you try everything on the menu , one after another , and , it 's remarkable that the only place i suggest you do that is not even expected to be that good with food ! <sssss> do n't dismiss the chocolate mints as just another after-meal freebie . <sssss> pure melt in the mouth stuff . <sssss> perfect finale to any meal at nordstrom .
?		this is disneyland for bakers ! <sssss> they have everything you will ever need to bake and more . <sssss> for a newbie baker , like me , it can be intimidating . <sssss> okay , it will be intimidating . <sssss> however , i can keep walking through their aisles for hours and not get bored . <sssss> so much to see , touch and feel . <sssss> not a five on five because i do n't like the neighborhood , and , in a store dedicated to baking supplies , i was not spoilt for choice for cupcake liners . <sssss> they have them in all sizes and colors , but , hardly any that make you go `` i want to buy these and bake cupcakes for a baby shower '' when none of your friends are pregnant !
?		melt in the mouth stuff . <sssss> when a cupcake is that good , i barely notice the price . <sssss> i know people complain about their price , but , i would rather pay the price than pile on calories eating a bigger/more sugary/less expensive treat . <sssss> never been to their bakery yet , but , i make sure i get my dose of their cupcakes when i am at the la grande orange cafe .
?		what 's all the hype about ? <sssss> yes , the fried chicken was good , but , the good ends there ! <sssss> the service was slow and they not only messed up our order but also came back twice with food we never ordered to confirm that we , in fact , did not order that ! <sssss> the tables are so tightly packed that we had to keep moving our chairs each time they had to serve other customers around us , which was practically ever 120 seconds ! <sssss> we asked for a couple of more plates since we were sharing , and , never got them until we reminded them three times . <sssss> also , the waffles that come with the chicken were so eggo . <sssss> would i go back ? <sssss> may be ; if i am really in the mood for their fried chicken and gather enough patience to deal with everything else that comes with it .
?		the brown butter sauce and pesto ranch are both worth trying at least once .
?		i love el encanto . <sssss> we recently took my grandma and my kid for lunch . <sssss> if you have n't been you should check it out . <sssss> there is a really cool outside patio area around a large duck/turtle pond which really is the focal feature of the place . <sssss> the chips and salsa are award winning and the lunch menu is great and really affordable . <sssss> i had the mole enchiladas and my husband had the fish tacos . <sssss> both were excellent .
?		cool place ! <sssss> we stopped in to check out a very talented friend 's artwork on the walls at cartel for the month . <sssss> the coffee drinks are great as are the beers .
?		i stopped in for dinner last night based on the menu i found on the web . <sssss> i was very attracted to the healthy options listed . <sssss> unfortunately , i passed over the salads and ordered the number two pizza . <sssss> it was n't bad . <sssss> it also was n't particularly memorable . <sssss> i suppose i 'd try it again , in a pinch . <sssss> what will keep me away from this location is the staff . <sssss> i 'd sure hate to see them during a lunch rush hour . <sssss> when i visited , there were only two customers in line and they seemed dazed and confused . <sssss> i stood at the counter for about five minutes -lrb- directly in front of two staffers -rrb- without being acknowledged . <sssss> finally , one looks at me as to ask what i was doing there . <sssss> i do n't believe he ever asked if he could help but i gave him my order , nonetheless . <sssss> there was a repeat scenario once i reached the cashier . <sssss> while waiting for my pizza to bake , another employee comes over to apologize about the wait on my tortilla soup . <sssss> i did n't order any soup . <sssss> let me repeat that there were only two other customers in line during my visit . <sssss> the staff was unenthusiastic and seriously lacked customer service . <sssss> everyone is entitled to an off day but this was ridiculous . <sssss> i wo n't reurn .
?		az 88 is a staple when i visit scottsdale , always a treat ! <sssss> the restaurant is off the beaten path and has an ultra hip vibe to it . <sssss> the wait staff is friendly and attentive . <sssss> the highlight , of course , is the menu . <sssss> they offer a great selection of burgers , sandwiches and salads . <sssss> they really know how to make a great salad too -lrb- i 'm convinced this is an art that is rarely mastered -rrb- . <sssss> i highly recommend the shrimp salad with the citrus dressing . <sssss> it 's divine . <sssss> i have not been disappointed with anything i 've ordered , though . <sssss> i 'm already looking forward to my next visit .
?		i 'm not quite sure why the restaurant is categorized under `` salads '' and `` vegetarian . '' <sssss> i do n't know that the menu has any more salad or vegetarian items than most other restaurants . <sssss> that aside , i really wanted to love the greene house , as i have been a supporter of all the other fox restaurants i 've visited . <sssss> this one missed the mark for me . <sssss> there was nothing unique about the menu and the food was underwhelming . <sssss> on the bright side , i thought the decor was nice . <sssss> i was particularly excited about trying it out because the description boasted healthy fare . <sssss> i figured i could n't go wrong with the kale salad . <sssss> well , i could ... and did ! <sssss> the salad was swimming in dressing and had the equivalent of a block of cheese in it . <sssss> to make matters worse , the flavors in the salad just did n't go well together . <sssss> i generally like most salads but this one was bad . <sssss> after the bad salad , i threw my health kick to the winds and opted for dessert . <sssss> surely , the restaurant could redeem itself with some sugary goodness . <sssss> eh , not so much . <sssss> i tried the pineapple rum cake with vanilla gelato . <sssss> what a disappointment . <sssss> it tasted like a slightly warmed honeybun with whipped frosting on top . <sssss> that might sound appealing to some but i did n't care for it at all . <sssss> when i splurge on calories , i want to be blown away ! <sssss> sadly , this just was n't it . <sssss> i did n't finish the salad or dessert . <sssss> the positive side of the visit : the waitress was awesome . <sssss> she was very friendly and attentive . <sssss> she suggested a fruit-muddled mojito that was quite yummy . <sssss> i 'm in no rush to return .
?		stax has become my favorite old town lunch spot and i 'm not usually a burger type of gal . <sssss> the food here is really good . <sssss> i love the variety of burgers -lrb- veggie , turkey , kobe , exotic , etc -rrb- and the fact that you can select the size you want . <sssss> this is great for sampling . <sssss> also , i am a fan of any place that serves sweet potatoes . <sssss> here , you get your choice of sweet potato fries or sweet potato tots . <sssss> i call that heaven ! <sssss> i understand the `` regular '' fries and tots are tasty , as well . <sssss> though , i 've only visited stax for lunch , i noticed that they have what appears to be a full-service bar . <sssss> they also have a kid friendly menu ... truly something for everyone here .
?		are you one that 's too embarrassed to sing karaoke in front of strangers ?! <sssss> geisha a go go could be the place for you ! <sssss> they offer a few rooms that fit 10 + people , so you can invite just those friends that you do n't mind embarrassing yourself in front of ! <sssss> so much fun ! <sssss> some girlfriends and i were able to belt out some awesome tunes this weekend ! <sssss> the only reason it did n't get 5 stars , was because it was $ 75/hour for the room ! <sssss> holy moly , i 'll pass on those kind of prices ! <sssss> granted , with that price came a super tasty plate of mixed sushi options . <sssss> thankfully my friend had won us a free hour , to sing til our hearts were content , and sing we did ! <sssss> : d
?		a friend of mine has been raving about this place for a while now , and with good reason ! <sssss> i was finally able to go here for breakfast over the weekend . <sssss> while my friends raved about their twist on french toast , i have to admit that was n't my favorite ... i did , however , love their blueberry pancakes ! <sssss> one would think you can get pancakes anywhere , but these were seriously amazing ! <sssss> while the food was super tasty and worth the higher prices , the way in which to order food seemed to contradict both a little . <sssss> overall , super tasty and definitely worth going back to ! <sssss> : -rrb-
?		prg is at the top of my list for climbing ! <sssss> their staff is always super helpful and they 're constantly changing up the walls . <sssss> side note though , if you 're a first timer , it 's more helpful going with someone who 's actually been before to use their tips and knowledge .
?		i always enjoy trying new places . <sssss> the burgers were good and the menu includes a wide variety of burger options . <sssss> good beer selection as well . <sssss> service was a little slow , but we arrived at the same time as a large group that took up half the restaurant . <sssss> i will definitely go back because the burger was tasty and i enjoyed the meal .
?		i have been here twice now and i am not real impressed . <sssss> the fish was not very flavorful and one of the friends with us actually had really undercooked halibut . <sssss> he didnt even want to order anything else as the first bite was enough for him to be turned off . <sssss> i was hoping for more the second trip , but left disappointed as i did the first trip .
?		this is a great spot for lunch . <sssss> the patio is a nice place to sit for a business lunch or even a casual chat with a friend . <sssss> the ahi tuna tacos were excellent . <sssss> the tacos come with all of the ingredients separate so you can put as much or as little of everything as you would like on the tacos . <sssss> the only thing i didnt like was the soda in a can because i just do n't like being served cans of soda at a restaurant . <sssss> especially when they charge 2.00 for the can .
?		the staff is so nice ! <sssss> some friends of mine threw an art and music thing there a few days ago and we had a blast . <sssss> the place is laid out nice , it has 2 stages and ample smoking patio space with misters and seating ! <sssss> -lrb- thats getting harder and harder to find -rrb- . <sssss> its really mellow , the decor is cool , the staff is awesome , and its nice and dark inside with a nice lounge area . <sssss> its also not your typically over priced tempe bar and you wont find throngs of college idiots shitfaced acting a fool . <sssss> always a plus in my book .
?		the only reason they dont get 1 star is because i understand they are n't accustomed to the heavier side of music and prolly panicked a bit when the bad brains came through . <sssss> that said , this place bites . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> they blocked off half the seating , oversold the show , and then were kicking people out for standing . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> it was a punk rock show following an am skate competition . <sssss> they were cutting people off that werent anywhere close to obliterated . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> the bathroom situation is chaos . <sssss> 4 . <sssss> the bouncers who usually work shows like barry manalow were acting like they were hell 's angels roughing up little kids trying to mosh and in the end pissed off the band . <sssss> 5 . <sssss> just to get into the place required every punk kid to remove every last bit of metal . <sssss> their punk kids man . <sssss> thats a lot of studs , chains , piercings , etc. . <sssss> what a hassle . <sssss> im sure its a great place to go see celine dion acoustic or something equally lame . <sssss> but why a place like that would book heavier stuff and then react like that is beyond me . <sssss> i felt like i was in jail . <sssss> only in jail the bathtub gin is cheaper and you dont get yelled at as bad for smoking too close to a doorway .
?		can i just say , i hate everything about this store . <sssss> if youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price , then i guess this is the place for you . <sssss> if you are trying to sell anything , good luck . <sssss> their askew sense of fashion will make most of your goods obsolete unless its tacky 80 's regurgitation . <sssss> the chick actually told me that the band t-shirts i was trying to pawn were too outdated while i had a bay city rollers and rockos modern life shirt in my hand off their rack . <sssss> they are incredibly overpriced , the staff has an elitist air for some reason -lrb- which you think would be hard to pull off in a tutu , leggings , and cowboy boots -rrb- . <sssss> saving grace , they have some killer old punk and skateboarding t-shirts on the cheap for guys and gals . <sssss> but the only time i even go here is when the boyfriend decides to go thru eastside records vinyl catalog in its entirity . <sssss> its like a plato 's closet for lady gaga .
?		when i want a completely over indulged , guilty-pleasure , -lrb- what diet ? <sssss> -rrb- meal i come here . <sssss> i love lolo 's . <sssss> the staff is warm and friendly . <sssss> there 's usually a wait -lrb- scottsdale location -rrb- , but it moves fast and is so worth it . <sssss> if you 're counting calories do n't come here ... you will starve , there 's nothing for you on the menu : -rrb- but if you want comfort food , soul food ... read on . <sssss> i always start with a nice tall jar -lrb- love -rrb- of old school red kool-aid ! <sssss> i die , it reminds me of being a kid , so good and pure sugar . <sssss> everything i have tried has been wonderful : fried okra , grits with butter -lrb- yum -rrb- , fried chicken , waffles , greens , mac & cheese , and to conclude a fabulous meal red-velvet cake . <sssss> take-out is great and done well .
?		so ... there 's been a ton of hype about this place , it 's always busy , so my expectations were really high . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> that 's it , just good . <sssss> if you are looking for a solid dinner out , this is a great option , i enjoyed my meal . <sssss> first i really liked the way the completely revamped the interior from it 's previous tenant `` that 's italiano '' . <sssss> its very open and warm -lrb- not temperature wise -rrb- . <sssss> we started with the grits and sausage , which were great , smokey and creamy , great combination . <sssss> for entrees i selected the vegetable chop salad , which really intrigued me with the pumpkin seed brittle . <sssss> it was ok , i really wanted it to be better , and it was n't bad , just a little lackluster . <sssss> i also had a side of roasted vegetables , which were very heavy on the smoke flavor . <sssss> my husband had the short ribs which he really enjoyed , very tender . <sssss> the service was fantastic , which is always a plus . <sssss> all in all , a great meal .
?		had an absolutely spectacular experience from start to finish , what a fabulous score for old town dining ! <sssss> we went for happy hour and it is by far the best happy hour in town ! <sssss> they offer a nice selection of wines by the glass for $ 5 each . <sssss> we decided to try an ample selection of appetizers to share to get a good feel for the menu . <sssss> we had the kobe sliders , the salmon bruschetta , the pulled pork sliders , the fig jam & ricotta sliders , the cesar salad , and the artichoke orzo . <sssss> the portion sizes were perfect and i ca n't say enough good things about the presentation ! <sssss> and the taste ... unbelievably good , like too good to be true good ! <sssss> we finished with a delightfully light tiramisu . <sssss> quality all the way around , by far exceeded our expectations , we will definitely be back . <sssss> the service was on par with our meal and flawless as well . <sssss> the server was attentive and witty , and the manager -lrb- owner ? <sssss> -rrb- took time to introduce himself and inquire about our experience . <sssss> if you have n't been , you must try it !
?		the sushi last night was excellent . <sssss> i got the roll with soft shell crab and eel sauce -lrb- ca n't look up the name because they have no online menu -rrb- sushi was fresh , rice was perfect , the roll was nice and stuffed they do n't give you those tiny rolls some other places do . <sssss> the service was quick and attentive , the location is super convenient and the ambiance is very pleasing . <sssss> my complaint . <sssss> the website has no menu , nor does it acknowledge that this location exists . <sssss> fix that immediately . <sssss> it 's 2013 `` menu coming soon '' does not cut it and i almost deducted a star because if this
?		this place is amazing . <sssss> mac n cheese , thirsty crow , good music , eclectic crowd , right off the lite rail what else could you want ! <sssss> the staff here is so personable , they remember your name , what you like to drink & they greet you like a family member they have n't seen in years i give it 5 stars because the food , atmosphere , service and cocktails are top notch ! <sssss> i ca n't think of anything to complain about . <sssss> lux has something special in its dna that i have not experienced anywhere else i 've ever been .
?		service is slow , i waited 27 mins just to place my order . <sssss> my wings were pretty good but they are over over priced to say the least , for what 5 small wings cost here i could pay a few more dollars and get a dozen somewhere else . <sssss> food = 3 stars service = 2 stars value = 2 stars
?		tj 's is a nice grocery store ... clean and convenient . <sssss> it 's unfortunate that a whole foods is so inconveniently located and not all that local , but in the mean time i find everything i need between here and the safeway on camelback and 32nd street . <sssss> i enjoy the fact that the produce is fresh , there 's a good variety of organics , the prices are reasonable , and they have a decent cheese and wine selection . <sssss> the pre-cooked items are pretty tasty as well if you 're looking for short cuts when you 're too tired , lazy , or just not feeling as though you want to spend the time on cooking . <sssss> they seem to pride themselves on quality and informing you , as the consumer , on what you 're paying for . <sssss> the employees have been , for the most part , friendly and helpful . <sssss> check out system is effective and they do a drawing for those who bring their own bags in and raffle gift cards - never won , but hey ... there 's always a chance !
?		went back in the evening for some more of the delicious bruschetta ! <sssss> this time i went with another friend and we shared that plus the artichoke dip and a sandwich . <sssss> we over ordered , but i wanted to try something new this time . <sssss> he wanted the `` nine iron '' which has chicken , bacon , mozzarella , lettuce , tomato , and dijionnaise on ciabatta . <sssss> it was rather tasty , however , the ratio of fillings felt a little off . <sssss> i love tomato , so it was n't a big deal to me , but the sandwich was full of it with one thin little leaf of lettuce and clumps of chicken that were n't evenly distributed between the ciabatta . <sssss> i ended up opening the sandwich and rearranging the ingredients myself in order to help it along . <sssss> fresh produce , good flavors and amazing bruschetta ! <sssss> honestly , i do n't think you can really go wrong ordering it . <sssss> the service we received this time around was n't up to par , but decent enough . <sssss> we did n't get our water refilled and the waiter never came back again so that we could order more drinks . <sssss> it was a shame . <sssss> the food still salvaged the visit though . <sssss> i just hope it does n't happen too frequently since i plan to come here more often with some more friends . <sssss> this time we sat on the patio since it was a little quieter in order to chat and despite the chillier weather -lrb- i say that loosely , since i 'm from chicago and should n't really complain ... -rrb- i found the outdoor torch like heaters -lrb- no , i do n't know the technical term for them and apologize for that -rrb- to be perfect along with my jacket . <sssss> next time around , i think i 'll try the soup and salad !
?		i 've tried their smashchicken and smashburger , but love their smashfries . <sssss> their burgers are tasty , but as a sucker for yummy fries ... i go here mainly for those when i 'm craving something salty and well , not so good for you - but definitely tasty ! <sssss> they 're usually pretty steady business wise , even in the off hours , but they manage to maintain a clean location that has pretty speedy service . <sssss> i 'd have to say though that with a decent amount of competition close by -lrb- primarily being zinburger -rrb- , they still hold their own . <sssss> i think next time i 'll try their salad instead though .
?		this place is an amazing place for timid to see what all the buzz is about sushi ! <sssss> i have been around the block w / sushi . <sssss> the fun thing about sushi is that its all about the rice and seaweed -lrb- nori -rrb- . <sssss> you do n't have to eat raw fish , in fact my last visit i had a california roll sans the fake crab meat and enjoyed miso soup w / a bowl of white rice . <sssss> if you do eat fish , you can indulge in the different varieties -lrb- although no different than the usual sushi bar -rrb- of fish . <sssss> yellow tail is great , better spicy . <sssss> the drinks are amazing too , but pricy . <sssss> i 'd suggest going at happy hour time and trying some of everything since it 's half off .
?		this place is a work in progress . <sssss> the most important part is that 1 . <sssss> they actually have an establishment now and 2 . <sssss> people are going to it ! <sssss> : -rrb- i was inspired by watching `` killer at large ... '' a documentary about how us americans have become overweight by not eating healthy foods , and accepting the cheap crap that stores pedal to us . <sssss> local vs imported food ... got me thinking . <sssss> `` i need to visit that farmer 's market today . <sssss> my usual hangout is sprouts , but even that can be a little chainy . <sssss> this place was small , almost felt like the japanese store up the road . <sssss> there were veggies , but not that many . <sssss> as i was imagining a huge selection of local crops . <sssss> lol i guess i forgot what local was in az . <sssss> . <sssss> the prices were somewhat steep , but all to be expected for as fresh as you can get . <sssss> i will visit this place again some time soon to see how it 's progressed with their selection . <sssss> i promote going to this store to give it a looksies . <sssss> i love that it is in walkable range from the surrounding neighborhood ... that is a neighborhood that seems to like anything organic . <sssss> if i was n't going to a million places afterwards i would have bought some cheese .
?		this place kicks ass in the customer service area ! <sssss> the waiter was swift taking orders , refilling drinks , bringing the food , and the bill . <sssss> the special was couscous with some veggies and a mystery red sauce . <sssss> did n't matter it was good . <sssss> it almost felt sad that the whole 12 '' sized dinner plate was cheaper than a happy meal minus the sweat shop made toy . <sssss> was full until now , midnight . <sssss> and what better meal to snack on late at night ? <sssss> a trashy hot pocket ... alla cuisine ! <sssss> rada and i have to have fun on a dime , so this place and it 's 5 dollar special was a match made in heaven for us . <sssss> the waiters were cute ... too bad they 're gay -_- it 's just a label right ? <sssss> tee hee 4 stars , good service , cute service , good food , cheap food .
?		up selling does n't work on tires ... if i had 500 to blow on rubber ... i 'd get 4 tires hey , maybe 5 . <sssss> or a lot of ... rubbers . <sssss> either or . <sssss> this place was quick and hassle free . <sssss> my favorite part was when the clerk told me i 'd blow up on the road if i did n't replace them all today :d great customer service skills there pal . <sssss> 4 stars because they did their job : selling and installing tires at a discount . <sssss> yeeey
?		go at 11:30 for lunch - parking is a breeze and easy to get a seat . <sssss> but they wo n't seat you unless your entire party is there , even if all but 4 tables in the entire place are unoccupied . <sssss> there were more people waiting for the rest of their parties than actually sitting in the restaurant . <sssss> it annoyed me until half-way through my lunch i saw the entire place was packed and there were people waiting to be seated . <sssss> smart move on their part . <sssss> my sandwich : chicken & proscuitto - deeelish ! <sssss> it was a big boy . <sssss> i had it with fries and ate it all , why oh why did i eat it all ? <sssss> it 's filling and large and i felt in charge after i snarfed it all down . <sssss> our server was quick and friendly , she filled our teas even thought the carafe sat on our table - i loved this by the way . <sssss> i ca n't get enough iced tea these days . <sssss> i will be back and i ca n't wait .
?		i seem to forget about lenny 's for my lunch break . <sssss> i 've only been here once and i really enjoyed my cheeseburger . <sssss> it 's a tiny , busy burger joint/diner on central ave. it 's quick too -- they got me in and out and happily fed in good time . <sssss> i need to pick a day soon to head over there again !
?		my fiance called it : `` the place you go to take your kids with runny noses and beat them in public '' it was a really strange experience when i went here ... like i was in a twilight world . <sssss> it was my first time in 5 years . <sssss> i watched a child with snot running down his nose and into his mouth wipe his face on a long sleeve in the clothing department . <sssss> now that is messed up !!!
?		just ca n't get into this place ... there are some really nice reviews about padre 's . <sssss> i 've been 3 times and all 3 times have left me just like `` whatever '' -- not really good , not terrible but more just nothing . <sssss> the service was odd , we were the only ones in there one time -lrb- this may have been when they first opened -rrb- and nobody came to our table , i had to go get someone . <sssss> so that right off the bat left me unhappy but i tried it a couple more time after that and i still got the nothing feeling and the service was as i said before , odd .
?		alex ` is is the perfect place to bring a client . <sssss> they serve dinner and lunch . <sssss> the nice atmosphere is conducive for conversation and eating . <sssss> there is massive lightrail construction going on in fornt of the restaurant though so getting in and out is not as easy as it used to be , but in soon time it will be back to normal . <sssss> anyhow , alexi 's is a nice place . <sssss> it has it 's old phoenix charm . <sssss> the owner , michael is also the owner of christo 's . <sssss> today , i had the filet minon and veggies , it was delicious ! <sssss> gov. janet napolitano is a fan ! <sssss> i hear she frequents the restuarant .
?		gon na have to do 3 stars on this one . <sssss> i 've had in my opinion 5 star sushi and this is not it , but it is still good . <sssss> i am reading all about this hotty hotterton service staff but i must have gone on the day they all at the gym and tanning b/c i did not see anyone looking so hot . <sssss> but i did see the cutest pregnant server who i was very impressed with her running around serving food -- she must be tired after work . <sssss> i guess she was kinda hot . <sssss> anyhow , i 'm not here to play the hot or not game but to review stingray . <sssss> so here it goes . <sssss> we got a nice variety of sushi and it was all tasty . <sssss> i was at a client lunch so we were able to sit and chat as well which was nice . <sssss> it was n't overly busy and the ambiance is very pleasant . <sssss> the fish in the ground when you walk in was kinda creepy and made me nervous to walk over it -- what if the glass broke and i got eaten alive by piranhas ? <sssss> not likely that they have piranhas but possible that i fall through the glass with my luck . <sssss> service was slow , but looks like that has been covered . <sssss> ehh , whatever , i was n't in a hurry so i honestly did n't really care . <sssss> when i am in a hurry and the restaurants are busy , i like to place my order and ask for the bill all in the same sentence . <sssss> works like a charm most of the time . <sssss> will i return to stingray ? <sssss> if i am in scottsdale and want sushi , i might , unless someone tells me a better place to try out in scottsdale -- i am always open to suggestions .
?		our server was very very nice and very accommodating . <sssss> i liked her a lot . <sssss> we all liked her a lot . <sssss> the sushi was plentiful and came on this gigantic boat that was kinda fun . <sssss> the price was right . <sssss> but why not more stars ? <sssss> it was the rice . <sssss> a bit gooey and mooshy for my liking . <sssss> the texture left me rubbing my tongue on the roof of my mouth . <sssss> as you know with sushi , the rice must be to perfection or else it 's disappointing and it 's all on personal liking as well . <sssss> my friends liked the rice , i did not . <sssss> so it 's all relative . <sssss> it 's byob , which is really cool and again the service was really great .
?		oh the bulk bins ... i love the bulk pins but i hate them all at the same time . <sssss> i love that it is so cheap and tasty but i hate that all it takes is one quick cough or sneeze and you can take home lucy lu lu 's cold . <sssss> iick -- okay , i wo n't focus on that . <sssss> this particular spouts got an entire face lift on the outside so it is looking really great . <sssss> the prices are hard to beat and the employees all seem helpful and nice . <sssss> sprouts is what i call `` alternative '' shopping . <sssss> it 's not the main-steam store but it should be , just need to get more into the habit of stopping by here . <sssss> it 's just easier sometimes to go the big grocers b/c i know they will always have what i am looking for and a larger selection . <sssss> but in the big scheme of things , sprouts has everything you need - just need to get past the whole `` variety '' thing . <sssss> the prepared foods are a good price too and tasty . <sssss> i 've tried different entrees and was pleased by all of them . <sssss> the bath and body section make me feel euphoric just by walking thru the isle , like i was so natural or something .
?		okay , so it looks like this place is hit and miss and i have an idea why ... ... because people have different expectations on this whole car wash thing . <sssss> so if you are super picky and have so many valuables in your car , why not just wash it yourself ? <sssss> i mean , these people are sweating balls washing your car and you only paid 7.99 -- good lord , i would barely clean the inside too if it was 117 degrees and i get a 50 cent tip from the a-hole in his mom 's bmw . <sssss> i hear people complain about danny 's in person not necessarily from yelp -- so this rant is for those that ca n't even voice their opinion on here . <sssss> but anyhow ... my car is way cleaner when i leave than it was before i got there and that alone makes me hap-hap-happy . <sssss> i also got paint balled recently and the cleaner i used messed my paint up pretty badly , danny 's fixed it for me for the bargain price of $ 79.99 -lrb- is this a bragain ???? <sssss> -rrb- and they shampooed the carpets too . <sssss> i 'm just happy the paint is n't forever ruined now . <sssss> i hate hs kids .
?		sacks is growing on me . <sssss> i think that i like my sandwich more when i do the `` self portrait '' and pick what i want on my sandwich . <sssss> they have plenty of choices , but i guess i can be picky with my sandwiches . <sssss> it gets busy here , lunch is best if you go a bit early or a bit later . <sssss> the phone is best for pick ups , it 's super easy and super quick . <sssss> the best part is that you get a little cookie with your sandwich and they have multiple iced tea selections . <sssss> all of them are delicious !
?		it 's unfortunate that some of my favorite stores are no longer in the biltmore and it 's remodel by westcor makes it look like all the other strip malls in az . <sssss> ... what happened to the old phoenix charm ? <sssss> where did it go ? <sssss> rumor has it that biltmore pushed banana republic out and restoration hardware . <sssss> i know gucci left b/c the rent was raised so high , they said f you - we are heading to scottsdale , leaving the expensive eye wear to be purchased as saks . <sssss> i also heard that all the restaurants will be gone and condos will be going in there and up -- is this true ???? <sssss> someone tell me !!!! <sssss> the most disappointing is the charm of the biltmore is gone . <sssss> it 's still pretty and nice to walk around but the charm is far gone . <sssss> it 's unfortunate . <sssss> although , my friends and i do think that there is an unwritten rule that only cute adorable children and precious doggies are allowed on the property and they must frolic and play on the grass . <sssss> so if you got an ugly kid , leave him in the car ala britney spears style .
?		completely mediocre and boring actually . <sssss> nothing great , nothing bad -- just cpk . <sssss> it 's there if you are hungry .
?		i have sucha great time when i go to kobalt . <sssss> it must be something they put in the drinks or maybe it 's the 9th drink or maybe it 's the good company . <sssss> this gay bar is my kind of gay bar . <sssss> i sang karaoke here once and once only -- it seemed i was surrounded by `` die hards '' -- well i sang the locomotion and i really thought i was kylie minogue but i was more like 8 year old miley cyrus singing my little heart out . <sssss> i think they faded the song about 1/2 way thru to get me to give up the mic . <sssss> my friend lured me away with a fresh drink . <sssss> this place is fun , easy going and the patio is big and welcoming . <sssss> i 'll be back for sure !
?		this location has become my # 1 favorite location in phoenix . <sssss> i used to go to the one at town & country because it used to be closer to where i live , but it was always so congested in there -- like crazy busy that it seemed to ruin the experience . <sssss> this location at tatum/shea is much more roomier and not nearly as `` mad-house '' - ish . <sssss> the employees are so nice -lrb- well , most tj employees are fabulous ! <sssss> -rrb- and helpful . <sssss> they will always go look something up for you or help you find what you need . <sssss> around the holidays , they all have some of the best holiday treats ever -- ranging from cookies , teas , chocolates , etc. . <sssss> i ca n't even function in december without the gingerbread coffee or winter blend coffee . <sssss> the prices are unbelievable affordable and the packing of their products are so cute . <sssss> i really ca n't say enough great things about trader joes , if you have never been to one , i suggest you get moving to your closest location asap .
?		i was craving this place so i was happy from the minute i parked the car . <sssss> i had the 2 tacos , rice and beans . <sssss> the rice and beans were fabulous , the tacos were so-so , but still filled my craving . <sssss> what i really wanted were chips and guacamole because i saw some other people eating them and they looked divine . <sssss> anyhow , i plan to go back and try more items off the menu . <sssss> but for the most part , i was pretty happy . <sssss> 1/27/08 -- the chips deserve 5 stars ohhhh the chips !!!!!!!! <sssss> i had the cheese enchilada 's last night , not good . <sssss> 1 star
?		when i first heard about this place months ago , i never thought i would be interested . <sssss> i do n't like southern or fried foods . <sssss> then i saw a write up in the newspaper where people voted on their chicken versus some fried chicken from some fancy place ... and it was pretty much a split decision . <sssss> the descriptions of the food made me want to try it . <sssss> so we went last night -lrb- friday night -rrb- for the first time to the scottsdale location . <sssss> it was busy , but we we still sat immediately . <sssss> i was starving and the smell was wonderful ! <sssss> i ordered the betty boop -lrb- one waffle and one breast -rrb- and sierra mist . <sssss> they do not serve alcohol here . <sssss> it comes in a huge mason jar . <sssss> i tasted the kool aid which was yummy too ! <sssss> we also ordered the macaroni and cheese . <sssss> the chicken and waffles came out first . <sssss> the mac and cheese did n't come out until we were almost halfway done with our meal , which was a little strange . <sssss> the fried chicken was absolutely amazing !! <sssss> it was perfectly cooked . <sssss> the chicken was so tasty . <sssss> the fried part is n't overwhelming and greasy . <sssss> i am definitely a fan of fried chicken now ! <sssss> the waffle was good , nothing special , but the sweetness did complement the saltiness of the fried chicken . <sssss> i would n't order the mac and cheese again . <sssss> it was a small portion in case you are thinking of sharing . <sssss> but it was too cheesy for my liking . <sssss> i liked that the manager came around and asked how our meal was . <sssss> she seemed to genuinely care what we thought of it . <sssss> i liked the food so much that i went again the next day with my two daughters ! <sssss> the place is kid-friendly , although there is not a kid menu . <sssss> i ordered both of them full plates , which i probably should n't have . <sssss> they could have easily shared one . <sssss> they loved it as well -- and the kool aid ! <sssss> i would definitely recommend this place ! <sssss> i never thought it would be somewhere i would like , but i will definitely go back . <sssss> best chicken ever ! <sssss> and cute t-shirts too ...
?		i 'm not a fan of cowboy ciao . <sssss> i know a lot of people love it , but i 'm just not one of them . <sssss> people love the chopped salad , but i do n't care for salmon , so i do n't really care for the salad . <sssss> i did like how they present it and prepare it at the table . <sssss> the appetizers were okay . <sssss> i liked the mac and cheese the most , but most of the other people at our table did n't care for it . <sssss> my boyfriend and i split the pastrami-rubbed filet mignon . <sssss> neither of us liked it very much . <sssss> it was completely drenched in gravy . <sssss> you could n't even taste the steak because of the gravy taste . <sssss> we had the peanut butter brownie for dessert . <sssss> it was okay , but definitely not worthy of a `` best dessert '' award ! <sssss> the worst thing was the acoustics in the restaurant . <sssss> we had a group of 8 and we could not hear each other talking . <sssss> you literally had to yell for the person next to you to hear you . <sssss> and i gave up trying to talk to anyone from the other end of the table .
?		loved coming here for a recent yelp event ! <sssss> i have n't been here in a few years . <sssss> it 's definitely a museum for older kids , so my little ones wo n't be visiting here for a few years . <sssss> i was able to finally visit body works . <sssss> what an interesting exhibit !! <sssss> i have only heard good things about it . <sssss> i , personally , had a bit of a reaction to it , but it was very interesting . <sssss> i just could n't get over the fact that these bodies once were mothers and fathers or children . <sssss> it was particularly hard for me to see the babies and development of a fetus . <sssss> i 'm glad i went , but i do n't know if i would go again . <sssss> it was a bit sad for me to see . <sssss> i think this is a good museum , but since i grew up in chicago , i am used to bigger and better museums . <sssss> i wish we had more here , but it is a good place for older kids .
?		i am from chicago and this is definitely my favorite place to go for pizza here in arizona ! <sssss> i 'm also a huge fan of sourdough , so it is pretty perfect for me !!! <sssss> my favorite is the thin sausage pizza . <sssss> so yummy !!! <sssss> parking is a pain and the wait staff is n't the friendliest . <sssss> i came in yesterday with my two daughters pretty early in the evening . <sssss> our waitress picked up my daughters plate before she was even finished , cleaned up the entire table while we were still sitting there , and even took all the napkins . <sssss> i needed the napkins to wipe their hands after eating pizza ... why would you take brand new , clean napkins away when i have two small kids with me ?
?		scottsdale quarter has been a nice addition to the scottsdale scene . <sssss> i love true food kitchen , narcisse and parc central . <sssss> primebar is pretty good as well for happy hour . <sssss> i 'm not a huge shopper but the retail component seems a little weak at sq. . <sssss> the apple store is nice though . <sssss> i 've been spending more time at sq lately than across the street at kierland commons .
?		on my way home from the baseball game i decided to stop in here and see what all the excitement was about . <sssss> i drove past it and then turned around and got a parking spot right by the door . <sssss> i ordered the dogfish shark taco and the cochinita pibil taco combo with rice and beans . <sssss> i received some chips as i left the order counter and stopped at the salsa bar to get some pico de gallo . <sssss> when i got to my table i scooped some pico onto my tortilla chip and wow , what great fresh taste ! <sssss> i also had some tomatillo , jicama and chipotle salsas that i tried on my tacos . <sssss> the shark taco was good and the cochinita pibil was even better . <sssss> even the small cups of rice and beans where really good . <sssss> i grabbed a menu on my way out and am already trying to plan what i 'll have on my next visit . <sssss> i especially ca n't wait to try the horchata .
?		i 've lived in this general neighborhood for several years and had never been to redendo 's . <sssss> i decided to give them a try for lunch this week . <sssss> this is a casual neighborhood italian place . <sssss> i ordered the chicken parm over spaghetti . <sssss> wow , huge portion ! <sssss> i took half of it home for dinner the next night . <sssss> overall , a nice experience . <sssss> pretty good food , friendly service and reasonable prices .
?		incredible experience . <sssss> short wait to get in and totally worth it ! <sssss> tony the host was great . <sssss> we tried three drinks and enjoyed them all . <sssss> the flaming presentation for the black bomber was awesome !
?		pretty good place to get deals on quality merchandise . <sssss> i like to buy my dress shirts for work here .
?		i stopped in monday morning to get some help with my iphone . <sssss> they were slammed and it took me a while to get someone 's attention to make an appointment at the genius bar . <sssss> the technician did a good job of helping me fix my problem . <sssss> then , i had to fight again to get someone to help me pay for my purchase . <sssss> not such a good first and last customer impression when it is so hard to get someone to help me in the store .
?		i 've been to several of the miracle mile deli locations over the years . <sssss> if you want comfort food , this is the place . <sssss> i was here today for lunch . <sssss> one of the specials on thursdays is meatloaf and that is what i ordered . <sssss> it was a good sized portion and i had the mashed potatoes with gravy as my side . <sssss> what a yummy good stick-to-your ribs meal ! <sssss> several times the servers came around while i was eating and offered to refill my iced tea which was very nice . <sssss> i 'm looking forward to coming back !
?		i stopped in here sunday for a beer . <sssss> my friend wanted a gluten free beer but had to settle for a cider . <sssss> i tried their orange blossom beer and it was just ok .
?		nice place to stop into for a beer . <sssss> cheap drinks and friendly service . <sssss> a mix of regulars and tourists . <sssss> occasional live music at night .
?		i 've been coming here since they opened up as the first restaurant at scottsdale waterfront . <sssss> great seafood , steaks , cocktails and wine . <sssss> stopped by today for happy hour . <sssss> the calamari is awesome and you ca n't go wrong with the $ 5 glasses of wine . <sssss> nice decor and great service . <sssss> patrick the bartender is fantastic !
?		i really enjoyed my first visit to ab . <sssss> nice decor and friendly staff . <sssss> the weather was nice so we sat outside . <sssss> i had the turkey pastrami sandwich with a side of cole slaw . <sssss> it made for a great lunch . <sssss> i 'd like to stop in here again when i 'm downtown .
?		large outside mall with the usual chain stores . <sssss> several of the restaurant spaces are now vacant .
?		last week was my third visit to noca . <sssss> since it was a thursday , i had the wagyu pastrami sliders . <sssss> they were very good . <sssss> thick pieces of meat on nicely toasted bread . <sssss> house made chips were great on the side . <sssss> good service . <sssss> top-quality restaurant all around .
?		amazing place . <sssss> i waited a year to try crudo and it was every bit as good as i hoped it would be ! <sssss> walking in i was immediately impressed by the minimalist decor . <sssss> like the food it was crisp , clean and modern with touches of comfort . <sssss> we had drinks in the bar and i enjoyed the rebel 's son cocktail with bulleit rye whiskey . <sssss> so many of the cocktails looked great it would be worth another trip to just sit at the bar and try a few more different drinks . <sssss> dinner was fantastic . <sssss> the service was friendly and very efficient . <sssss> i think the set price 3 or 4 course menus are the way to go . <sssss> you can order anything on the menu for your choices so you really ca n't go wrong . <sssss> we each ordered different things from two 3 course menus so we got to try 6 different dishes ! <sssss> my favorites were the albacore with green apple and truffle oil and the pork belly on polenta . <sssss> for dessert we shared a chocolate pudding type dish with peanut brittle . <sssss> no wonder they were invited to cook at the james beard house . <sssss> they are doing everything right at crudo !
?		i stopped in yesterday around 5 pm for happy hour . <sssss> i like the new decor and that they moved the bar back into the center of the room . <sssss> the appetizers were half-off and i tried the shrimp and grits . <sssss> they were delicious . <sssss> spicy seasoning , creamy grits and a good sized portion . <sssss> they also have a great selection of unique beers . <sssss> i saw a trappist monk offering on the menu for $ 26 . <sssss> i settled for a 90 schilling amber and it worked perfectly with my appetizer . <sssss> i came back over around 8 pm for the big grand opening party and they were slammed . <sssss> i waited at the bar for about ten minutes trying to get a drink but to no avail . <sssss> on my way out i did get a chance to see marsella . <sssss> that 's always a nice treat !
?		fantastic day saturday for lunch at central bistro . <sssss> the doors were all open and the breeze and light from outside were wonderful . <sssss> my lobster bisque was great and the burger hit the spot . <sssss> service was friendly and efficient . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back .
?		i 've been to the grimaldi 's in dc ranch and the one in old town . <sssss> this new location is very good as well . <sssss> in my opinion , the best seat is at the bar facing outside . <sssss> the view of the mcdowell mountains from that spot is great . <sssss> we chose a pizza with ground beef , mushrooms and onions . <sssss> it came out perfect . <sssss> thin crust so you do n't get too full . <sssss> the large size was enough so that we had a few pieces for leftovers . <sssss> washed down with a couple of blue moons , it was a nice dinner .
?		these guys have a nice place in a great location . <sssss> i sat at a table in the bar and watched part of the saturday round of the pga . <sssss> as previous reviewers have mentioned , there are plenty of flat screens here . <sssss> i ordered a grinder , fries and iced tea . <sssss> they were all very good . <sssss> the service was super friendly and i 'm looking forward to coming back soon .
?		i 've been having lunch at one place or the other that jene , the owner , has worked at for almost fifteen years now . <sssss> why ? <sssss> good comfort food and good service . <sssss> i stopped in here yesterday for lunch . <sssss> the weather was nice so i sat outside on their patio . <sssss> i had my favorite sandwich , the cajun chicken club . <sssss> a cajun spiced chicken breast , with cheese and bacon on toasted sourdough bread . <sssss> it was good , as usual . <sssss> i like their spicy potato salad as well . <sssss> this is a great neighborhood place . <sssss> all the servers are so friendly . <sssss> i got ta get back sometime and try them for dinner .
?		i really like their chocolate chip scone . <sssss> it tastes great and really is quite large . <sssss> also , it 's nice that they have a selection of newspapers to read while you are there .
?		i was here recently for the rattlers arena bowl game . <sssss> kinda cool to see football in a basketball arena . <sssss> lines were a little too long for the concession stands .
?		this is the place to go in scottsdale for an italian beef . <sssss> when i visit chicago i usually go to al 's or portillo 's for italian beef and having al 's here saves me the trip to the windy city . <sssss> the decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason . <sssss> it 's neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service . <sssss> i ordered the regular al 's beef with sweet peppers . <sssss> i usually do n't order my sandwiches `` wet '' because they come with plenty of juice already . <sssss> good flavor and just the right size . <sssss> the fries were thick but a little greasy for my taste . <sssss> all in all , a good lunch and a place to keep in mind when i 'm feeling like a taste of chicago .
?		fun place . <sssss> food is decent . <sssss> i was here on super bowl sunday and it was packed . <sssss> i 'd consider it again as a place to watch a game .
?		this review is for lunch only . <sssss> both of my visits were on days with perfect weather . <sssss> the doors of the dining room were opened up to the patio and the scottsdale mall . <sssss> it was a gorgeous setting . <sssss> they have an outstanding lunch deal . <sssss> for $ 15 you get a drink , chips and salsa , an appetizer and a main course . <sssss> the quality of the food and flavors are all top notch . <sssss> the highlight for me was the posole soup . <sssss> huge chunks of pork belly and a few little neck clams in a flavorful broth . <sssss> i also tried the red snapper fish tacos and the carne asada . <sssss> both were delicious . <sssss> for $ 15 it was such a great value i almost felt guilty . <sssss> almost .
?		buried treasure ? <sssss> this weekend i went strip mall crawling in search of new eateries with interesting tap beer selections . <sssss> found a greek place buried in the worst location i have seen in a long time . <sssss> the landlord should pay the business to occupy this space not the other way around . <sssss> anyway , i walked in and was surprised to see this little place had four beers on tap with three i had n't tried yet . <sssss> the beers were good . <sssss> the service was good . <sssss> the owner stopped by our table several times to chat us up , which was fun . <sssss> i liked the atmosphere . <sssss> greek music was playing , the décor was warm , and the owner was working the crowd . <sssss> had a really nice mom and pop hole in wall feel . <sssss> not too busy , not too slow , just right . <sssss> this is a new business that has n't been open long . <sssss> i hope i am not jinxing it with this review . <sssss> the food was really good !!! <sssss> the owner delivered our entrees and the aromas alone were worth the price of admission . <sssss> that food was hot and smelled good !!! <sssss> we tried the lamb burger and some kind of greek lasagna . <sssss> both were hot , fresh , and spicy . <sssss> tried three desserts the crepe , some kind of stuffed puff pastry and got the baklava to go . <sssss> all good , good , and good ! <sssss> the owner brought over a shot of chilled ouzo to finish off the meal . <sssss> this place is buried treasure ! <sssss> bottom line : i had a blast at this little place and can not wait to go back and try some different menu items or just sit on the patio and sample the draft beers on a nice day . <sssss> if you go ; look for the bike shop on the nw corner of alma school and germann . <sssss> trust me , the bike shop is much easier to find . <sssss> the restaurant is next to the bike shop . <sssss> cheers .
?		nice draft choice at good price fun atmosphere pricey ok food
?		this review is for bass pro 's restaurant atmosphere , atmosphere , atmosphere i make a pilgrimage to this place about every three months . <sssss> the food is average and overpriced . <sssss> the service is ok . <sssss> and there is usually one good pale ale on tap and overpriced . <sssss> it is kinda like going to disneyland . <sssss> you know you are going to take in the shorts but you go anyway . <sssss> you go to live the dream if only for an hour or two . <sssss> if you ever went fishing as a kid or wished you had , grab your wallet or purse and eat here asap .
?		i really liked this place . <sssss> we came with a business group of around 20 for an early dinner and they got everything out correctly and promptly . <sssss> the beans are great as is their eggplant . <sssss> the beef skewers were ok , nothing too great but decent . <sssss> their noodle dishes are really good and i liked the quality of the food and found it to be very tasty . <sssss> my only complaint was that i was really searching for spicy dishes and even the ones that they said were spicy really were n't . <sssss> i put their house made hot sauce/oil on my dishes but it still did n't really add heat though it did add some good flavor . <sssss> i was a little overwhelmed by the menu and am looking forward to coming back and enjoying some more adventurous dishes when i am not with my co-workers who wanted to share everything and stuck to orange chicken , etc. .
?		i do n't like to give 5 stars especially when it 's my first time somewhere but this place gets it . <sssss> it smells so amazing when you walk in , fresh baked bread and goodies , yum !!!!!! <sssss> the menu is expansive and you can find something for everyone . <sssss> i got a grilled pork banh mi and an order of spring rolls . <sssss> the banh mi was amazing ! <sssss> pork was so juicy and tender and had great flavor . <sssss> the bread was just right : chewy but with that great baguette crunch . <sssss> i loved the amount of veggies they put on : perfect balance of the flavors and great crunch from them . <sssss> good heat from the jalepenos , though i wound up adding hot sauce , too . <sssss> spring rolls were n't as good as i 've had but did not skimp on the shrimp and were tasty enough . <sssss> prices are amazing and the food is ready super fast ! <sssss> they also have ice cream which they were nice enough to let me sample . <sssss> the taro flavor is awesome ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back and get a cone . <sssss> note : they only take cash but they do have an atm inside . <sssss> great place and i will definitely come back .
?		meh . <sssss> seriously , meh . <sssss> i would never have chosen to come here on my own but my office group picked here for our end-of-year luncheon so i was sort of obligated . <sssss> it 's just kind of ... well ... it 's gross , frankly . <sssss> i already get weirded out by buffets but this one was really gross . <sssss> the `` sushi '' is so disgusting and nothing is labeled so you have no idea what you 're even putting on your plate since many of them are fried , which means they are soggy since they 've been sitting out god knows how long . <sssss> the order to things is bizarre . <sssss> they have donuts next to shrimp next to fried rice and apple pie next to pizza but then they have a whole separate section for desserts ? <sssss> the food was bland , oily and lukewarm . <sssss> ugh , never again . <sssss> if my work picks this place again , i 'll feign the stomach flu .
?		the mesa location does n't have quite the quaint charm of the tempe location but the food is still great and the patio is ample . <sssss> all the pasties on the menu are very good and the traditional ones do stay very true to the old country recipes . <sssss> the dessert pasties are worth a try if you have room . <sssss> i also enjoy picking up the ones you can finish baking at home . <sssss> drink prices are always good and they normally have specials going . <sssss> my favourite is the shepherd 's pie or the bangers and mash . <sssss> ask for extra red-wine gravy .
?		this place was ok . <sssss> i was hoping to be wowed since people really seem to like it . <sssss> it was a little pricey for what it is . <sssss> we ordered the chips with the salsa flight . <sssss> we paid the $ 6 for the refillable chips -lrb- which i think just is silly , seriously , if every other place in az can give me free chips , you should , too . <sssss> charge me for the salsa flight , sure , but chips and your average pico de gallo really ca n't be breaking the bank for you . <sssss> -rrb- we wound up not even getting a chip refill so that was a waste -lrb- we just could n't eat that many chips -rrb- . <sssss> the pico was average , the other two were pretty decent . <sssss> husband ordered the carne asada tacos . <sssss> they were pretty good . <sssss> the tortillas had a nice bit of char on them which was good and nice big slices of avocado which was nice . <sssss> i ordered the grilled steak salad . <sssss> pass . <sssss> there were three tomatoes in it , literally one chunk of avocado and it really was a tiny salad for what i paid . <sssss> the steak on top was pretty good but all the other elements were so scant it really was n't worth it . <sssss> the sonoran margarita was pretty good . <sssss> the house ones were just average . <sssss> overall , i would n't come back most likely for full price but may come back for happy hour .
?		i was tipped off about this place by a co-worker . <sssss> we made a last minute decision to eat dinner here , instead of the vig on easter sunday night . <sssss> so glad we did ! <sssss> the food was awesome . <sssss> the skewers were great and the bbq flatbread pizza was huge . <sssss> we drove around a bit for fear of parking in a spot that was n't the hideaway 's ... but when we got inside there is a sign that says you can park anywhere in the lot and not get towed . <sssss> just an fyi . <sssss> i thought the two guys that were tag-team bartending/serving were very attentive . <sssss> and i 'm a server so my standards are kind high .
?		was recommended tp me to try by a co-worker . <sssss> had a `` eh '' experience . <sssss> an `` eh '' experience is what you say when recommending the establishment to someone else . <sssss> and that sums up my experience . <sssss> service had a rocky start ... my friend started a tab before i got there and i sat for 15 min waiting for a server before i went to the bar . <sssss> five minutes later a different server came over and had taken over our tab . <sssss> so problem solved . <sssss> we had a couple of the 1/2 price apps . <sssss> they were good - calamari and potato skins . <sssss> pretty standard stuff . <sssss> overall , i 'll go back for some hh specials but i 'm not going to be the one suggesting it to people . <sssss> i 'll stay up by 16th and bethany home instead .
?		do n't ever eat here . <sssss> i 'll never go back . <sssss> it only got one star specifically because it did serve me food and drink . <sssss> unfortunately , the service was horrible -lrb- and i 'm a server -rrb- - and it took over 1.5 hours for us to get four sandwiches . <sssss> we got no explanation and no apology . <sssss> we were only able to get one beer refill during that period of time . <sssss> and for four people , our bill ended up being a ridiculous amount of money ! <sssss> do n't do it ... you 'll hate yourself after wards . <sssss> i 'm pretty sure everyone else giving it five stars must be sleeping with someone that works there .
?		my first visit to the lost leaf was last friday during first friday and we did n't stay for even 10 minutes because it was so packed . <sssss> last night , after lots of peer pressure , i ventured over there again . <sssss> it was a lot more mellow then . <sssss> we had a good group of people and grabbed a really high top table . <sssss> the lost leaf carries a lot of different beers ! <sssss> alas it was a school night so i could not partake of it too much.i ca n't wait to go back and try a bunch of them ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to return to lost leaf and increase their rating . <sssss> for now i 'll leave it at 3 , i was only there for about an hour . <sssss> i think if you just want to chill with some friends , drink some interesting beers and chat the night away , this is a great spot to do it !
?		i attended a uye at il posto on mardi gras . <sssss> i enjoyed it very much . <sssss> i shared a pizza that was pretty darn good with matthew k and sampled a few other pizzas with other people . <sssss> i did n't much care for the crust of the pizza , but the pizza itself was very flavorful . <sssss> my drink of the night was a strawberry lemonade alcoholic beverage that the bartender was having trouble getting right . <sssss> each time i had to help him out with the formula of sweet to sour , but he was a good sport about it . <sssss> our large group sat out on their clean a pretty patio . <sssss> it grew chilly so they lit the fire pit for us . <sssss> i can imagine sitting on the patio and enjoying drinks with friends here . <sssss> i would most certainly visit il posto again . <sssss> their pizzas were flavorful and the service was great !
?		my visit to this place was not only disappointing , but it made me sad to think that this place would probably go the way of planet hollywood in a year or two . <sssss> i had the carnitas and i had to cut -lrb- or should i say saw -rrb- into it with a knife and fork . <sssss> my friend 's crab enchiladas were underwhelming . <sssss> i was heartbroken that yet another famous latino is slapping his name on a `` brand '' that will probably fail instead of actually checking out the food and making sure it 's edible . <sssss> very beautiful decor , and nice -lrb- but not terribly sharp -rrb- staff is about the only thing i can say about this one .
?		moira has grown on me . <sssss> they are n't my favorite sushi in the the valley , but they certainly try to be ! <sssss> their location is much welcome in the downtown phx area . <sssss> now , i am a sushi snob , so i do n't think they have the freshest cuts or the most creative menu . <sssss> i do think that if you 're downtown and craving sushi , -lrb- especially late night -rrb- they get the job done . <sssss> if you want a really good bargain , hit their happy hour and reverse happy hour . <sssss> you can eat a ton of sushi on the cheap and go home satisfied . <sssss> if you 're there for happy hour , try the white blossom and the vegas . <sssss> both rolls are not very `` authentic '' or `` traditional '' but both are very tasty . <sssss> off of their regular menu , i suggest you try their hamachi yellowtail sashimi with a side of sriracha , the sunshine roll and the spicy hana roll are both good choices too . <sssss> moira offers many exotic mixed drinks to tempt your palate into trying something new , but be careful of the prices . <sssss> the drinks can run anywhere from $ 7 - $ 10 and add up quickly . <sssss> if you 're downtown and do n't feel like driving far or detouring from the light rail , go to moira for your sushi fix . <sssss> they have some solid choices for your sushi craving .
?		i was out running errands when i got hungry and decided to take a shot on two hippies beach house . <sssss> i pulled in and almost hit a crack head who walked in front of my car with two phoenix police officers as witnesses to this mishap . <sssss> after waiting for said crack head to skitter away , i got out of my car and approached the line . <sssss> one of the officers said to me `` good brakes ! '' <sssss> whew ! <sssss> for my lunch , i decided on a fish burro sans cilantro and a peach lemonade . <sssss> i was thankful for the cash i had in my wallet as they do not accept plastic of any form . <sssss> i only had to wait for about 5 minutes for my food to be done and i was on my way home . <sssss> i unwrapped my burro and took a huge bite . <sssss> hmm ... nothing too amazing , just ok . <sssss> first off . <sssss> i dislike when restaurants do n't warm the tortilla that they make burros with and yes , this blatina can tell the difference . <sssss> second , the burro was full of cabbage and not a lot of fish . <sssss> the salsa was good and flavorful so i used a lot of it to flavor the burro and it brought some good spice to the burro . <sssss> overall it was just ok . <sssss> nothing amazing and nothing i would crave . <sssss> the real winner was the peach lemonade that comes in slushy form . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> i would visit two hippies again to try their other offerings . <sssss> the price is good , and the food is ok .
?		los compadres is an a-ok place to stop and have some a-ok mexican food . <sssss> you order via a friendly counter service and they give you a number . <sssss> i ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans . <sssss> they were good ! <sssss> nothing fancy or spectacular , just straightforward . <sssss> i wished for a little more flavor in the chicken , but it was n't horrible . <sssss> i also ate ayesha 's leftovers the next day ... solid . <sssss> if you 're looking for a spot that 's a bit `` hole in the wall '' simple mexican , then los compadres is the spot for you ! <sssss> i would gladly return and try their other entrees !
?		want a simple breakfast without doodads and sprinkles ? <sssss> hate when people come clapping by your table to sing happy birthday to little timmy in the booth behind you when all you want is some f-ing breakfast and coffee ? <sssss> matt 's is the place for you . <sssss> i had the pleasure of meeting amy d for lunch here a while back . <sssss> i must say i was seriously surprised how simple everything was . <sssss> i do n't know what i was expecting , but this is a pretty straightforward breakfast joint . <sssss> for my breakfast , i had bacon , eggs , hash browns and 1 pancake that was large enough for two . <sssss> i washed it all down with their honey sweetened lemonade , which i thoroughly enjoyed ! <sssss> so why three stars ? <sssss> first of all , a three star rating is not a bad rating . <sssss> second , it 's breakfast . <sssss> there really is no way to mess up a simple breakfast . <sssss> i definitely will go back to try their burgers and maybe i 'll boost my rating . <sssss> matt 's is a-ok in my book and i look forward to going back !
?		switch has really picked its game up in the past year or two . <sssss> i remember the days of eating at switch and walking away from the place saying , `` yeah . <sssss> . <sssss> that was just ok '' . <sssss> they seem to have a new chef now , or they really took customer feedback into consideration . <sssss> i have been to switch several times and have found new things on the menu to love . <sssss> from the delicious and rich lobster and crab puffs to the hearty and filling apricot bbq feta chicken sandwich . <sssss> one of my favorite sandwiches is the mozzarella caprese ciabatta . <sssss> i usually add prosciutto to my sandwich and it makes it that much better . <sssss> try the sandwich with a side of sun dried tomato risotto ; yum ! <sssss> sometimes they have some amazing specials . <sssss> about a month ago , for brunch , i enjoyed the chef 's special of duck hash . <sssss> the hash was well made and flavorful . <sssss> i felt lucky that i came in for a quick brunch that day . <sssss> he 's always thinking something delicious and `` hangover friendly '' on the weekends . <sssss> my latest crush is apricot bbq feta chicken sandwich . <sssss> `` oh , what 's that ? '' <sssss> , you might ask . <sssss> well let me tell you , my friend . <sssss> that 's a sandwich comprised of warm , sliced chicken , a sweet apricot bbq sauce , sauteed spinach , sharp , tangy feta cheese , and a garnish of onion and cilantro -lrb- i usually skip the garnish due to personal taste -rrb- . <sssss> the sweet and tangy combo is amazing . <sssss> i highly suggest it . <sssss> you might , also , want to give their onion rings a try . <sssss> i 'm not a huge fan of onion rings , but switch makes some darn good ones . <sssss> did you think i would n't comment on their drinks ? <sssss> to be honest , i 'm not a huge fan of switch 's drinks . <sssss> i always have to upgrade my alcohol selection and ask for less syrup in order to avoid hangover city . <sssss> when i do order a beverage , i tend to go with a drunken italian soda . <sssss> if you 're looking for a nice lunch or dinner spot that is n't too hard on the pocket book , give switch a try . <sssss> their affordable , and creative meals will make you make that switch !
?		want to know how to wake this diva goddess up early on a saturday morning ? <sssss> tell her there 's a farmer 's market that sells delicious and fresh food ! <sssss> ding ! <sssss> i had the pleasure of visiting the otfm with mr. hottie and my favorite foodie bear and what an adventure it was !! <sssss> i wo n't write too terribly much about it , because how many reviews can you read about fresh produce and freshly baked goods ? <sssss> a highlight of my visit was the fresh mozzarella i bought from the digestif booth . <sssss> i watched it get freshly formed and was educated about where their ingredients come from . <sssss> it was so yummy ! <sssss> i also visited the sweet republic bus , and the mclendon farms operation . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> i also got to meet a few fellow yelpers and share some yummy bread from their quest for fresh goods . <sssss> i will certainly return to otfm ! <sssss> -lrb- i heard a rumor that they will be moving the market into the underground parking area for the summer time -rrb- it was such a pleasure eating a meal made from the fresh ingredients purchased from local vendors !
?		i adore places that transport you to another locale without even driving too far ! <sssss> one beautiful sunny afternoon , i asked a friend to have lunch with me at the farm kitchen . <sssss> we only drove 5 minutes away from the office and we were on a farm at a picnic table enjoying a wonderful lunch . <sssss> the line had already started to form for the lunch at the farm . <sssss> we walked into a little building lined with racks of local product to peruse while you wait to get your order started . <sssss> for my lunch i chose the turkey curry sandwich , a slice of pecan pie and a lemonade . <sssss> everything was really tasty . <sssss> i could have used more mayo on my sandwich , but that was a personal preference . <sssss> the curry on the sandwich was n't overpowering . <sssss> it was wonderfully complimented by the sweet cranberries . <sssss> the pecan pie was so good ! <sssss> my lunch pal left her dessert alone to dig into my pie ! <sssss> the lemonade was , lemonade . <sssss> not to sweet , not too tart . <sssss> the farm kitchen is a great place to step away from it all if only for a lunch hour . <sssss> the food is good and well made , and the setting just ca n't be beat !
?		this place is by far one of the nicest sushi bars i have visited . <sssss> it 's in a great location -lrb- love the biltmore ! <sssss> -rrb- and it 's seating outdoors is unbeatable . <sssss> the staff is also dressed up in japanese clothing . <sssss> i love zen32 for having a wonderful and peaceful ambiance . <sssss> however , i am a sushiholic and while i do love a great place to enjoy my food , i value the quality of the food a bit more . <sssss> zen32 sushi was just mediocre sushi . <sssss> not good , not bad , just okay . <sssss> it was n't enough to make me want to return for more : -lrb- sorry zen32 , you are gorgeous , just not the total package : -lrb-
?		mmmmmmr . <sssss> sushi ! <sssss> this was the place i lost my sushi virginity to , and the place responsible to getting me hooked ! <sssss> i love the location , right off of the freeway , as if it were a sushi pit stop ! <sssss> the best part of this place is it 's very low key and casual . <sssss> a comforting place to pig out on sushi . <sssss> the sushi is very authentic which is rare in an over-sushied city . <sssss> each roll is beyond delicious and made to perfection . <sssss> this place is underrated . <sssss> grade a rolls at a low key location ? <sssss> awesome !! <sssss> the service is also very speedy , hooray ! <sssss> this is a perfect place for a quick lunch . <sssss> i 'm still a huge mr. sushi fan after so many years . <sssss> four stars !
?		about three times a week i drive by this adorable little coffee shop , wanting nothing more than the time to pull over and sip some morning coffee . <sssss> this morning , my dream came true : -rrb- parking was a cinch , the diagonal parking spaces are perfect for pulling in . <sssss> upon entering , my eyes were having a feast . <sssss> pink counters , adorable tables , pretty displays , the works ! <sssss> everything to the menu had been creatively made pretty . <sssss> this is my kind of coffee shop , girly prettiness all over : -rrb- i ordered my coffee and surprise , surprise , the barista was nice . <sssss> in this world of evil eye emo baristas there is one that is bright eyes and happily making coffee . <sssss> . <sssss> hip hip hooray ! <sssss> i just must add a note that this place was incredibly clean and organized , goodness it was a dream : -rrb- they have two dollar lattes , yes it is true ! <sssss> so if you are in the neighborhood and need your caffeine fix , this might be a place to lift your spirits pre and post coffee drinking : -rrb-
?		i 've seen lola coffee appear recently on one of my favorite blocks in downtown phoenix . <sssss> the day i finally set foot in there i was pleasantly surprised and am happy to say lola coffee was beyond what i expected , and i was expecting it to be fabulous ; -rrb- the parking is easy to get in and out of , plus plus ! <sssss> there are two entry ways , one in the front and one in the back . <sssss> the decor/ambiance of the coffee shop is awesomeness . <sssss> it is a cluster of rustic , vintage and post modern . <sssss> the people inside seemed like nice/interesting people reading their morning paper rituals over coffee . <sssss> the shop is very clean , organized and `` pretty '' . <sssss> the barista and cashier were both very friendly and welcoming . <sssss> oh how i love when people making coffee have some extra enthusiasm that rubs off on me and sparks up a positive day for me : -rrb- the coffee was fresh . <sssss> the power of fresh coffee is beyond words : -rrb- they have all the essentials to making your own coffee to your preferences . <sssss> they also have some not-so-ordinary pastries on display that look delicious . <sssss> overall , i am giving lola coffee five stars . <sssss> i loved the location , the inner setting and the people that work there . <sssss> great service and a great commodity ! <sssss> five stars for this cenpho coffee house : -rrb-
?		authentic old school saloon . <sssss> i liked it a lot here . <sssss> its a very small bar , but its got stools , and whiskey at a fair price - thats all i need ! <sssss> its right in old town & when i went , there was more of an older-tourist crowd as opposed to the college young ` ins . <sssss> i swear i also saw the worlds oldest cowboy here - had to be 142 years old . <sssss> so if your in a cowboy chasin -- whiskey drinkin kind of mood - check this place out .
?		finally made it to narcisse on friday night and found the place quite fabulous . <sssss> with it 's glam decor , comfy seating , and pretty views i was a happy camper . <sssss> i got served my drinks very fast each time i ordered , the music was pretty loud but still enjoyable , and the crown was attractive , friendly in the late-20 's to early 40 's age range , which is just right for me . <sssss> it 's nice enough to wear heels and a little dress , or even jeans and a cute sweater . <sssss> it was not overly crowded , nor did we have to wait in line to enter so nice job narcisse ! <sssss> i shall be back for sunday brunch to take advantage of your $ 10.00 endless bubbly 's !!
?		the green belt makes me wish so bad that i knew how to ride a bike . <sssss> i used to fall of my tricycle as a kid , but thats another story . <sssss> this place has an awesome relaxed , peaceful vibe . <sssss> great for a jog , for walking your pup , or for a picnic date . <sssss> it goes on for miles , and makes for great sunrise/sunset views . <sssss> i 've seen a couple creepers here & there , but nothing that would keep me from coming back .
?		this place was recommended by people at work so checked it out yesterday , and i was not disappointed . <sssss> i started off with the richest , most moist red velvet cake i 've ever had . <sssss> was so rich , that i only was able to eat 1/3rd of the slice . <sssss> i went with the `` betty-boop '' plate which consisted of 1 breast and 1 waffle . <sssss> perfect portion . <sssss> i 'm no master chef , but i believe i tasted a bit of cinnamon or some kind of spice in the waffle - it was very delicious . <sssss> the fried chicken was my favorite part if the meal . <sssss> i took advantage of the chile vinegar as well as the louisiana hot sauce . <sssss> i also love they serve kool-aid here . <sssss> the prices are decent - not too cheap , not too expensive . <sssss> overall , i would love to come back and would recommend this place to anyone who likes some good fried chicken .
?		i 've only been here during christmas season , the place is so lit up with christmas lights you can see it over a mile away . <sssss> it definitely has an old dive-y atmosphere , but who does n't like a comfortable , quaint little charming bar that serves cheap booze right ? <sssss> its small inside , but has a good size patio full of heaters , and this place pulls in a decent crowd too . <sssss> i hear it 's the oldest tavern in scottsdale , i really hope it lasts many more decades .
?		not bad but not great . <sssss> definitely targets a younger crowd - college kids . <sssss> i like that it has a casual feel , but made me feel cougerish . <sssss> my drink -lrb- jack & 7 -rrb- was quite stiff - nidi likes . <sssss> also , good prices on beer . <sssss> tip - check this place out wednesday nights around 10 .
?		the food here is super good . <sssss> i recommend the carne asada nachos . <sssss> my other main recommendation would be the blended/frozen margaritas . <sssss> i like coming here for some daytime drinking . <sssss> great open patio makes you feel like you are on vacation in cabo .
?		man , this place is run like a well oiled machine for sure , almost military style ! <sssss> i had been dreading coming here as i am not a fan of crowds or lines . <sssss> there are always crowds and long lines here , but do n't let that discourage you , they really do go fast . <sssss> from the items i 've had i would recommend the italian beef sandwich , the cheese fries and the chocolate cake shake . <sssss> not so much the chili cheese fries , or the croissant beef sandwich - they were ok , but i think the portions are on the smaller side , and the meat lacks some flavor . <sssss> but do n't get me wrong , its good grub and all . <sssss> its just all the crazy hype holds it up too high , and its hard to meet those expectations . <sssss> tip - they ship their food all over the us - how cool is that ?
?		you ca n't really go wrong with flemings . <sssss> very romantic , and dark inside . <sssss> you get what you pay for , and here , you pay alot . <sssss> portions are small , but thats kind of a good thing if you ask me . <sssss> service is top notch and so is flavor . <sssss> came with my mom & we both had the restaurant week specials . <sssss> i went with the chicken & mom got the steak . <sssss> both were incredible . <sssss> my only regret was not getting the chocolate lava cake . <sssss> this is a must at flemings - deelish !
?		the food is 5 stars ! <sssss> absolutely delicious ! <sssss> but 3.5 stars overall . <sssss> negatives include the slow service . <sssss> do not go here if you are already hungry . <sssss> you can literally feel yourself aging while you stand helplessly waiting for your food . <sssss> it 's not uncommon to wait a good 20 - 30 minutes . <sssss> also a negative - price . <sssss> i 'm guessing they probably do have all of their ingredients flown in from italy , because the price reflects it . <sssss> i guess you do get what you pay for . <sssss> typically you 'll spend $ 10 for a sandwich , $ 3 - $ 5 on sides and $ 2 - $ 3 for your drink . <sssss> the happy hour prices seem okay -lrb- $ 2 beer -rrb- . <sssss> seating is extremely limited . <sssss> barely any room to even move around in here . <sssss> also , your table is so close to the other tables that people are participating in your conversation . <sssss> kinda creepy ! <sssss> the outdoor seating is basically lawn-chair , patio furniture . <sssss> and location/parking . <sssss> not the best , especially with the crazy road construction . <sssss> but i guess in the end ... it is what it is . <sssss> i still return and will continue to help support local businesses .
?		love this place ! <sssss> the chicken and waffles are better and cheaper than lolos -lrb- which is just down the street -rrb- . <sssss> disappointed i could n't substitute my eggs for another waffle or anything , but that 's just how life works , i guess . <sssss> the food is delicious . <sssss> the prices are decent . <sssss> the service was n't bad . <sssss> 4 stars !
?		on your first visit , you will probably go into shock . <sssss> this is one of the most amazing stores i have ever visited . <sssss> i 'm not really much of an outdoors guy , but this store will turn you into one . <sssss> just walking around it is awesome . <sssss> a great place to visit even if you are n't looking to buy anything .
?		4 stars for the food . <sssss> everything we ate was quality ! <sssss> i do love the location . <sssss> not far from my house , great neighborhood , not sketchy -lrb- so you do n't have to look over your shoulder as you walk to your car -rrb- , quiet area which closes down around 10pm . <sssss> like the atmosphere and the service . <sssss> only negative is how small the place is . <sssss> dining at 7pm , the tables were full , place was packed , and so incredibly loud it was impossible to participate in conversation . <sssss> but oh well . <sssss> monday night football was on the tv , so no conversation was actually necessary .
?		great food , and affordable as well . <sssss> my wife and i get it to go . <sssss> it travels very well . <sssss> i 've had better naan , but overall . <sssss> it 's great indian when you have the craving . <sssss> tip : do n't get the meat naan .
?		ahi tacos were perfect but i needed one more tortilla . <sssss> rice and beans were great too , and it all fit together masterfully . <sssss> i will definitely be back . <sssss> this was one of the best meals i 've eaten in a long time . <sssss> on the downside , we sat outside directly under one of the cooling mist makers and ended up soaked .
?		amazing food ! <sssss> strange location with just enough ambiance to feel like it 's worth the prices . <sssss> our server was knowledgable and friendly though she could have been a bit more proactive in making recommendations to some people who were clearly in over their head . <sssss> i loved everything i had but the pork belly and crispy pig 's ears stand out as clear favorites . <sssss> i wish i was rich so that i could dine here regularly !
?		fish and chips was very bland . <sssss> i like to have a little bit of flavor aside from the sauce that i put on but this fish did n't have it . <sssss> it seemed fresh , just lacking . <sssss> the fries were disappointing too . <sssss> probably wo n't be back .
?		ok words ca n't quite describe just how good i think this place it . <sssss> my parents were in town for thanksgiving and then back again a few weeks later for graduation . <sssss> after coming to roka for the first time thanksgiving weekend my dad 's first idea for dinner when they got back to town was to come again . <sssss> the family favorite on the menu is either the rice and mushroom hot pot or the butterfish . <sssss> both are fantastic . <sssss> i could eat the hot pot for lunch alone . <sssss> nothing we had in either visit was bad but the let down was probably the kimchi dumplings , not becuase they were n't good but because all the other food just blew us away . <sssss> the waygu beef sushi was fantastic and just melts in your mouth . <sssss> even the miso soup is better than any i have had before . <sssss> one of the best touches i saw was fresh grated wasabi coming with an order of tuna . <sssss> i had never seen it grated right from the root before , only the green paste . <sssss> it 's small touches like this that makes roka a step above the rest . <sssss> the housemade drinks -lrb- i think it 's call surgue -rrb- are very good but they also have a very nice selection of alcohols . <sssss> a martini with the ginger vodka is a great choice . <sssss> the service is also top notch with drinks being filled promptly , menu items being very well explained and just a great dining experience . <sssss> hands down this has become a top 5 family favorite restaurant for us , worldwide .
?		ding ding ding we have a winner in the over crowded tempe thai battle royal . <sssss> in a tiny town with about as many thai restaurants as gas stations this one just jumped way out ahead of the pack . <sssss> i have been looking for one thai place that just jumps out and hits all the right taste buds and reminds me of the great thai i would find in the pacific northwest . <sssss> this one comes the closest . <sssss> the massaman curry was excellent in the hot spice with a nice burn but distinct flavors still coming thru . <sssss> the chicken satay was great and the peanut sauce was perfect and not just peanut butter with chilli paste like most places . <sssss> i loved the eggplant dish with beef as it was the first time in a long time i got an eggplant dish where it had plenty of eggplant and it wasnt just mush . <sssss> plus the flavor of the eggplant , basil , spices and beef all came through . <sssss> top this all off with friendly service and perfectly reasonable prices this is a true winner . <sssss> i am just sad i am .3 miles outside the deliver zone . <sssss> maybe if a offer up an arm or a leg i can get it .
?		wow i absolutely love this place . <sssss> i have been here twice now , once a bit over a year ago and again last week for restaurant week . <sssss> the food is amazing . <sssss> the item that i remember from my first visit that got me to come back was the bacon dipped chocolate s'mores . <sssss> they are amazing i love the savory sweet combo of the bacon and the homemade marshmallows are fantastic . <sssss> the peanut butter is also great and does n't have that super creamy over processed taste that stuff like skippy has . <sssss> to reverse course the meal started with the sausage and grits appetizer which was fantastic . <sssss> little bits of sun dried tomato mixed in made this a fantastic dish . <sssss> the sausage had just the right amount of heat to pair perfectly with grits . <sssss> the bread that we got was fantastic as well . <sssss> the honey wheat was my favorite but the jalapeno cheese was really good too . <sssss> i also got the zucchini cakes which were phenomenal . <sssss> i love fried zucchini and fresh and these were the best of both worlds . <sssss> the flavors that were packed in while still keeping the taste of the zucchini was great . <sssss> the aoili that it came with was really good as well . <sssss> pretty sure it was a cilantro lime but had some other flavors too , i think lemongrass was one i picked up . <sssss> the main course was the pork loin with baked beans and coleslaw . <sssss> our waiter , who was fantastic , strongly recommend this and i could n't have been happier taking his suggestion . <sssss> this was like the fanciest bbq you could possibly have . <sssss> it took classic bbq flavors and paired it with a perfectly cooked chop . <sssss> i am not a huge coleslaw fan but i ate every bite on this plate . <sssss> was a great blend of upscale cuisine and backyard bbq . <sssss> overall it was a fantastic meal with great service and very good food . <sssss> ca n't wait to come back and try some more . <sssss> very happy to have been here and to have beckett 's table be my 100th yelp review .
?		need drunk food on mill ? <sssss> look no further than silvermine . <sssss> they stay open late to feed that post boozing hunger and they have good subs to boot . <sssss> i got a sub with roast beef turkey and cheese and it was just what i needed . <sssss> my buddy got some of the broccoli cheese soup which was surprisingly good and i am not even a fan of broccoli cheese soup normally . <sssss> only real knock on this place is that it tends to be a bit pricy when compared to other similar sandwich places
?		i have to second jesse j 's comment about this place and add another woooooooow to the list . <sssss> been here twice now and each time i have left full , delighted and taste bud happy . <sssss> my favorite things on the menu are probably the appetizers with the millionaire lobster tacos and mixto cerviche being melt in your mouth good . <sssss> the shrimp chicharron have a nice little kick to them that is offset nicely with the endive . <sssss> on my most recent trip i got a main course of the mahi mahi with calamari . <sssss> it was fantastic . <sssss> i wish i could describe all the flavor combinations but there was just such a rich blend i could n't even begin to do it justice . <sssss> the fish was perfectly cooked and i was a happy camper . <sssss> for sides i highly recommend the arroz tostado en cazuela with the crab and asparagus making a great and tasty rice dish . <sssss> there is plenty to share so it says for 2 people but if you have a few people and another side there will be plenty since entre portions are generous . <sssss> the dessert is the best part with the white chocolate cigar -lrb- dusted in coco powder to look like a cigar -rrb- and expresso gelato being one of the best desserts i have had at a restaurant . <sssss> what was really cool was since i was there celebrating my graduation and the waiter knew he told the chefs in the back . <sssss> they decorated a piece of chocolate garnish with congrats on it -lrb- i will add the photo -rrb- . <sssss> top this all off with a quiet and nice setting in the basement of the westin and you have a winner . <sssss> seeing the artist paint live in the entry hallway is a cool little extra . <sssss> it may seem odd to have dinner in a hotel basement but it is well worth it .
?		let 's start this off by saying my love of the seattle seahawks and the fact that this is the official bar of the arizona seahawkers association may tint my view of the place . <sssss> that being said i have gone to skeptical on occasions other than seahawks games , which for the record are an insanely fun event here , and enjoyed it . <sssss> skeptical is an irish bar but the food is far from your typical irish fare although they have some of the classics like a shepherd 's pie that is stellar . <sssss> my favorite things to get here is the muscles in broth appetizer . <sssss> think of this as a bowl of incredibly flavored soup with garlic , leek and red pepper and the added bonus of having a generous serving of muscles and topped with bits of thick bacon . <sssss> if that does n't have your mouth watering maybe the kicker of a side of garlic toast will put you over the top . <sssss> they also feature a great selection of beers including rotating beers in bottles and on tap . <sssss> the mainstays such as guinness , harp and kilkenny are always flowing . <sssss> there are only two reasons that i have subtracted a star . <sssss> the first for me is that i am not a fan of the flatbreads , i have tried several and none every hit the spot . <sssss> friends have had them and enjoyed but this just does n't do it for me . <sssss> the other is a hit and miss issue that has happened only for seahawks games where i have felt that the servers have been somewhat unavailable and slacking when it comes to checking back in . <sssss> i understand for big events they have lots of tables and are busy but even with that factored in there are some who just do n't seem to care . <sssss> the only reason i even mention this is because there are some who i have seen work their butts off to keep every drink filled and people happy . <sssss> when the tables around me see their servers 3-4 times before i see mine , it 's an issue . <sssss> check them out but do n't dare walk in here wearing enemy colors on game day unless you are prepared to hear all about it from the great fans that show up .
?		why is it so hard to find a good bagel and lox these days ? <sssss> i really wanted a good small non-chain bagel place to go to -lrb- read : not einstein 's -rrb- to go to with some good bagels and quality lox to have . <sssss> i had high hopes for this place that would take me back to when i would get bagels with my grandpa back in boston but this place failed . <sssss> i have tried twice now hoping that maybe it was just the bagel i got or the day i went but same result over priced for mediocre quality . <sssss> the bagels did n't have much flavor and were over toasted , the lox was bland and way to slimy and seemed like it was the cheap stuff from costco -lrb- not even there good stuff -rrb- . <sssss> the only good thing was that the creamy cheese was well flavored and the tomatoes seemed fresh . <sssss> for a near $ 10 price tag though i was very underwhelmed and actually preferred the bagels and lox at einstien 's . <sssss> i guess i will keep trying in my search .
?		i 'd probably give a place like this more points if they were n't so damn over priced and had a bit better execution . <sssss> a fairly small tuna poke appetizer and 2 not that special rolls for over $ 30 without drinks really ? <sssss> the poke was ok but not anything like a traditional poke and for some reason they add what seems to be spicy tuna sauce to the tuna first which i do n't get and made it a bit too spicy for sharon h. without mixing it with the rest of the dish . <sssss> i liked it overall but not as poke which is a very specific taste to me this seemed to lack . <sssss> the sunkissed roll was a good idea but needs better execution . <sssss> i want avocado and salmon with each bite not on alternating pieces . <sssss> oh and premium avocado has good flavor and is n't bland . <sssss> i did like the special sauce . <sssss> a little less onion or maybe not raw onion might help too . <sssss> the anago tempura roll just misses the mark for me and was over priced for what it was as it was tempura eel with cucumber , mint and fried garlic . <sssss> at $ 11 most places have an eel and cucmber roll for $ 5 and the little slivers of garlic and sprig of mint are n't worth an extra $ 6 . <sssss> plus the thing was just too many conflicting flavors and the garlic was over cooked to being so hard it was like biting a piece of rock it actually hurt a bit and did n't feel natural . <sssss> to top this all off i just did n't feel the fish quality was up to par . <sssss> the salmon especially did n't have the normal taste . <sssss> i will give sushi places a pass when its cheap and not that high quality but when it 's expensive and lacking its a problem . <sssss> the salmon had a fishy taste and did n't have that normal salmon flavor which stood out the most .
?		just tried out this spot for the first time tonight . <sssss> living in phoenix , my standards for chinese food are not very high in general , but alas ... the boyfriend was craving and prime is just a few minutes from our place.thought we would give it a go . <sssss> have to say , this place was much better than i was expecting ! <sssss> we walked in to find a surprisingly minimalist , modern decor ... nice . <sssss> the host greeted us almost immediately , and we opted to go with two egg rolls with the chicken teriyaki and general tso 's -lrb- i had wanted to try the pumpkin chicken listed on the menu , but apparently its only available in november ... sad day -rrb- . <sssss> our food was ready in about 15 minutes , we carried out , and on the short drive home the boyfriend noted that if the food tasted as good as it smelled , then we were in for a real treat . <sssss> needless to say , it did not disappoint . <sssss> the entrees , especially the sauces tasted notably homemade ... not full of corn syrup and artificial flavors . <sssss> i liked the authentic flavors and generous portions of chicken -lrb- however a minimal amount of veggies -rrb- . <sssss> the rice had more flavor than per usual , and was cooked perfectly ! <sssss> the egg rolls were a treat , and overall the food was pretty satisfying . <sssss> my only complaint is that the food could have used a bit more flavor and a larger serving of vegetables . <sssss> in short : it 's clean , cute , great service and good food . <sssss> i would go back . <sssss> entrees start around $ 8 and go up to $ 13ish .
?		what an adorable and oh-so fun local spot to go and get your happy fix ! <sssss> i went in just before christmas and dropped about $ 45 bucks on some unique novelty items and hard to find vintage candies , plus i had a fantastic time doing so . <sssss> smeeks is good for three things : - fun and inexpensive novelty gifts - old school sweets like pop rocks , candy cigarettes , and moon pies - just having fun and maybe even squeezing in a photo booth sesh i will return anytime i have the need to feel like a kid again , want to pick up some fun party items , or have something to celebrate .
?		shame on me for not dining here sooner . <sssss> noca is absolutely perfect in every way possible . <sssss> i ca n't even begin to explain how ridiculously delicious the food is here . <sssss> you just have to experience it for yourself . <sssss> my friend and i each each had several courses for dinner . <sssss> naturally , we shared each one to sample as many things as possible . <sssss> the pork belly confit was divine . <sssss> the mussels steamed in in white wine , garlic , and chorizo were titillating -lrb- make sure you have extra bread to sop up that amazing broth -rrb- . <sssss> as for the main course and dessert , i wo n't go into details , but both were simply stunning in flavor and presentation . <sssss> super fresh ingredients . <sssss> inventive menu . <sssss> impeccable service -lrb- except the fact that they lost my reservation ... thank goodness they had a table for two available ! <sssss> -rrb- , and not the very least pretentious . <sssss> book a table at noca and bring on the foodgasm .
?		as far as atmosphere and drink selection go , it 's hard to beat anywhere in arizona , let alone in downtown phoenix . <sssss> i love how this spot books free live music every single night , displays local artists ' work on the walls , has an ever-increasing selection of brews and is a great example of historic preservation . <sssss> they also accept phx bux , so you can save some cash on your drinks . <sssss> score ! <sssss> yeah , it can be packed on the weekends . <sssss> and sometimes there are annoying djs . <sssss> sure , the `` bar '' is actually a half-kitchen , and the `` tap '' is actually an oversized fridge packed to the bones with bottles of suds . <sssss> but i 'll take this place over just about anywhere else , any time . <sssss> here 's hoping they install the promised taps soon and open that patio space out back .
?		finally tried this place -lrb- i know , i 'm soooo out of the loop -rrb- and i was very impressed . <sssss> it 's hard to find a great quaint little breakfast place that is actually accessible at all times -lrb- sorry , matt 's -rrb- . <sssss> the décor is great . <sssss> this old taco bell has barely been converted at all , save for a few walls knocked down to make a patio -- a very cool wood-encased little shell of a space . <sssss> the open-air roof keeps it breathable , but you 're cool as a cucumber . <sssss> the inside is diner supreme : bright colors comfy bar stools in a rub-your-elbows-sized room . <sssss> i think the prices are very decent and you get bigass portions . <sssss> i had the sirloin and eggs . <sssss> i was craving something hearty , and i got it . <sssss> this is like half a cow chopped up into little bites , three eggs however you like them , carmelized onions cooked to perfect tenderness and diced jalapenos for some added kick . <sssss> it rocked my life . <sssss> and have you tried the over easy iced coffee ? <sssss> cold-brewed coffee -lrb- read : strong -rrb- over ice with sweetened condensed milk , cardamom and cinnamon with mint leaves . <sssss> it 's f ` ing ecstasy . <sssss> try it , you 'll love it .
?		i want to like this place a lot . <sssss> grand desperately needs some strong eateries . <sssss> sapna seems like it should be excellent : cheap , healthy food in a unique triangle-shaped setting . <sssss> so what went wrong ? <sssss> i 've given this place several tries . <sssss> every time the service is terrible . <sssss> they 're understaffed -lrb- even when we were the only table there ... one person working at a restaurant is n't possible -rrb- , and if there are more than three employees there at once , they always get confused . <sssss> i 'm not sure what the reason is ... the place only has like eight tables . <sssss> second , the atmosphere is depressing . <sssss> sapna has a really different setting in the tip of the bragg 's pie building . <sssss> if anything , the atmosphere should be the automatic winner . <sssss> instead , it 's a plain white room with plain white plastic tables . <sssss> last time i was in there , the one painting hanging on the wall fell off , hitting a patron in the head . <sssss> then it took several minutes for the server to get him some ice . <sssss> he had a nice ole welt . <sssss> i like the quesadillas here a lot . <sssss> the food is fresh ... just not always tasty . <sssss> the ratatouille is strong . <sssss> i have yet to find a really great salad on the menu .
?		if you like blaring house music , kisras and strong mixed drinks , fez may be your new special place . <sssss> i 'm a big fan of the the latter two , so i put up with the house music . <sssss> perhaps i do n't totally fit into the fez clientele , as i typically go for the more chill-out spots , but the quality here is hard to ignore . <sssss> the restaurant is really a beautiful space . <sssss> they did a great job with the interior and the covered patio is excellent year round . <sssss> and that couch/lounge space against the far wall : one of the comfiest spots in phoenix . <sssss> but do n't overlook the food . <sssss> i 've seen countless reviews of fez , both on yelp and otherwise , where people say the food is bland . <sssss> i do n't agree . <sssss> there are big flavors here . <sssss> they mix antioxidant-packed fruits , strong cheeses , excellent sauces and quality grilled meats . <sssss> everything i 've tasted has been a flavorful explosion . <sssss> i 'm not much of a martini kind of guy , but this place has quite the selection . <sssss> if i did n't own an adam 's apple , i 'd probably go for that chocolate one . <sssss> like five times in a row . <sssss> i 'll stick with the margaritas , which are surprisingly good despite the fare being far from mexican . <sssss> plus , you can stumble a few steps outside onto the light rail when you 're done .
?		went here this morning . <sssss> as usual , the wait was crowded out to the corner of 1st street . <sssss> people are willing to wait for good food , i suppose . <sssss> once you get inside matt 's big breakfast -lrb- it was about an hour wait for us on a saturday morning -rrb- , you see why it took so long . <sssss> there 's about 15 seats in the whole place and it 's tiny ... like a manhattan hotel room . <sssss> people are bumping into each other , sliding around and the commotion is high . <sssss> it 's loud , it 's gritty and it 's the perfect diner setting . <sssss> for all the press it 's gotten , the food better be damn good . <sssss> and it is . <sssss> the eggs are cage raised and organic , the pork is from high-quality iowa farms and most of the produce is local . <sssss> the fresh-squeezed oj is legit . <sssss> and the coffee is from a premium roaster in cave creek , az . <sssss> . <sssss> the hash browns are very much like you would find at a joint in the midwest : buttery on the inside and crispy brown on the outside . <sssss> do yourself a favor and brave the wait and the commotion ... it 's worth it .
?		i had a delicious latte here . <sssss> they say they have the best espresso maker in town , and it 's kind of hard to argue . <sssss> this place is hipster supreme to the max and way better than any other coffeehouse in tempe -lrb- sorry , gold bar , i 've betrayed you -rrb- . <sssss> my favorite thing about cartel -lrb- besides the strong brew , of course -rrb- ? <sssss> they play damn good tunes all the time . <sssss> there 's no better soundtrack in the valley . <sssss> they also have art for sale that 's actually affordable -lrb- and usually quite interesting -rrb- . <sssss> and people are nice here ... what a concept . <sssss> i 'm glad they 're into the green movement using `` plastic '' cups made of 100 % corn . <sssss> downside : i wish they had longer hours and more comfy chairs . <sssss> those plastic fold-up chairs really suck compared to the comfy couches .
?		i ca n't tell you for sure . <sssss> it may be that this place is n't that great . <sssss> but since i basically just * completed * over a cupcake i think that five stars is the least i could do . <sssss> i 'm gon na tell you a secret -- if you follow @sprinkles on twitter they sometimes have secret codes you can whisper to them to get a free cupcake . <sssss> today it was a free red velvet for the first 25 ppl that came in and whispered `` 3 . '' <sssss> so in order to prevent myself from going there every morning when they open and getting a free cupcake , i will tell you all the little secret . <sssss> -lrb- it only works if you are also following @spirit_fingers -rrb- today an enchanting girl -lrb- the most enchanting of the five enchanting girls there -rrb- told me that i would be a fool to not get the pumpkin cupcake with cinnamon cream cheese icing . <sssss> i love pumpkin more than pretty much anything but goddamn is their red velvet cupcake -lrb- cream cheese icing -rrb- good . <sssss> so i did n't know which to get -lrb- at this point did n't realize the red velvet was a door prize -rrb- and finally settled on the pumpkin -lrb- mainly because of her brown eyes -rrb- . <sssss> -lrb- not really . <sssss> food before hoes , or whatever the saying is -rrb- as i unwrapped the pumpkin cupcake , i felt the surge of anticipation familiar to teenagers everywhere . <sssss> every scent struck me where it counts . <sssss> every soft , moist hunk of delightfulness made me weak . <sssss> i 'm mixing my metaphors and it 's confusing me . <sssss> the pumpkin , anyway , was ridiculous . <sssss> so fucking good . <sssss> you owe it to the fat person in you to go there and get some cupcakes , stat .
?		a very tasty place for breakfast . <sssss> i strenuously object to any place that does n't serve hash browns , but really that 's my only complaint . <sssss> they have a ton of different omelets/scrambles -lrb- you choose -rrb- and you can make your own . <sssss> example : spinach tomato sausage bacon with american cheese . <sssss> as a scramble . <sssss> with salsa . <sssss> the coffee is good -lrb- i hear from my wife -rrb- and the cinnamon roll is a real treat . <sssss> not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8.5 / 10 . <sssss> it is true that there can be a very long wait so plan ahead for sure . <sssss> you 'll be waiting outside . <sssss> they grill their wheat toast-solid .
?		you know the arrogant asshole that no one wants to like -- because he 's an arrogant asshole -- but everyone begrudgingly does like -- because he 's just so damn good ? <sssss> -lrb- resist the temptation to say i 'm that arrogant asshole -rrb- well , the original pancake house is just that arrogant asshole . <sssss> what you 'll notice when you first arrive is -lrb- usually -rrb- a long wait and a bunch of rules . <sssss> cash only . <sssss> we 'll only seat full parties -lrb- or even put their names in line -rrb- . <sssss> substitutions at a la carte prices . <sssss> sharing requires an additional fee . <sssss> only short stacks of 49er flapjacks on the weekends . <sssss> etc. . <sssss> etc. . <sssss> so the first time you go there , you 'll probably think , `` this place may be good , but it wo n't be * that * good . '' <sssss> well you 'd be wrong . <sssss> i was . <sssss> the food here is bar none the best basic breakfast food you 'll ever eat . <sssss> it 's just perfect . <sssss> the strawberry pancakes come with this amazing strawberry syrup that is good enough to eat by itself with dabs of the homemade whipped cream -lrb- i know from experience -rrb- . <sssss> the patty sausage is a pure euphony of spices . <sssss> my heart skips two beats every time i eat there . <sssss> recommendations : the french crepes . <sssss> if you like strawberries and/or anything delicious , have the crepes . <sssss> the only , and i mean only problem with them is that they do n't come with anything salty so if you want a variety then have a bite of someone else 's shit because you absolutely must have these things . <sssss> 49er flapjacks -- thin , chewy , mindbendingly good . <sssss> pecan pancakes . <sssss> they also offer many different types of crepes , oven baked omelettes , chocolate chip pancakes , coconut pancakes , blueberry , bacon pancakes , and on and on . <sssss> and , if it looks good to you , their specialty is this gigantic apple pancake -- but imho it is n't the best thing on the menu . <sssss> same with the dutch baby . <sssss> look : i know food . <sssss> really . <sssss> if you do n't like this place , then you are just a hater . <sssss> sometimes you have to look past the rude hostess , the long wait times , and the excessive rules and just enjoy the best breakfast that the city has to offer . <sssss> and at least now they have a goddamn atm in the store .
?		another on the list of items that you simply must have before you die : the tomato gin soup at wcg . <sssss> i will agree that the place has its misses on the menu , but overall it is a very solid place with at least one completely exceptional soup . <sssss> they have a filet cobb salad with a red wine vinaigrette which is really good and i always love the baked broccoli or the honey-gooped carrots -lrb- not their real name -rrb- . <sssss> finally , their sandwiches are really tasty . <sssss> the story goes that some people split off from houston 's and went off to start wcg . <sssss> you 'll see that right away . <sssss> but whereas houston 's is a five star delight , wcg merits only four . <sssss> but trust me when i tell you to get the tomato gin soup . <sssss> today .
?		here 's what i remember about last night 's uye afterparty at shady 's . <sssss> disappointment . <sssss> i do n't remember much but i do know that i set a timer on my calendar to go off at 10am today and the entry was mysteriously succinct : `` blast the fuck outta shady 's . '' <sssss> so on the strength of that little memory jog i will attempt to reconstruct what it was that upset me . <sssss> ah -- i remember ! <sssss> it was the annoyed bartender whose name rhymes with patchouli . <sssss> i must be a really annoying motherfucker -lrb- do n't comment on that . <sssss> it 'd be common of you to do so . <sssss> -rrb- because this chick was so snooty at me and all i was doing was harmlessly drinking a beer . <sssss> many beers . <sssss> i do n't know what it is about bars on indian school and their employees who dislike drunk people but shit . <sssss> anyway , there was a pool table and the water did n't taste so offensive . <sssss> and georgeann g was there . <sssss> otherwise this place might well have gotten fewer stars . <sssss> oh sure , i 'd go back .
?		this is the sort of review that the liberty market powers that be might not want to associate themselves with . <sssss> they should read it , and then disavow it if need be . <sssss> so we 've been to lm a bunch of times . <sssss> i famously said that i 'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake -lrb- more on that later -rrb- but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu . <sssss> well all that changed two visits ago . <sssss> my wife ordered the italia salad , which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans , kalamata olives -lrb- the lone blight on the salad , but i can appreciate that that 's only my opinion -rrb- , and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all . <sssss> totally delicious . <sssss> and i ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing . <sssss> totally delicious . <sssss> it comes with ricotta cheese and onions , the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza , on the whole , being perfect in every way . <sssss> thinish crust -lrb- but not too thin -rrb- and just really flavorful . <sssss> we got all that last night , too , and it was amazing again , but the trip was marred by ... the worst customer ever to live . <sssss> if you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s , wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head , and a t-shirt with `` talk to the -lrb- paw print -rrb- '' emblazoned on the front , look out . <sssss> you 'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other , who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet . <sssss> woman : i 'll have the -lrb- five thousand different desserts to go -rrb- and the pecan bar . <sssss> but not the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan . <sssss> i hate that . <sssss> hapless employee : okay ... what about that pecan bar right there . <sssss> woman : no ! <sssss> not that one . <sssss> look . <sssss> you can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan . <sssss> no , i want that one -lrb- the one predictably buried under thirty others -rrb- . <sssss> that * should * be all right . <sssss> it looks okay . <sssss> hapless employee : uh . <sssss> okay . <sssss> sure . <sssss> woman : -lrb- orders fifty more things -rrb- hapless employee : -lrb- rings up woman . <sssss> she pays . <sssss> -rrb- woman : and make sure that i do n't get the pecan bar because -lrb- points credit card menacingly at hapless employee -rrb- i am * very particular * about this . <sssss> if it does n't look right , i will send it right back . <sssss> hapless employee : okay -lrb- reassuringly -rrb- . <sssss> we will . <sssss> thank you . <sssss> so i roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar . <sssss> then we order , etc. . <sssss> a couple of pointers . <sssss> one -rrb- if my wife thinks you 're an asshole , you are . <sssss> she 's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing . <sssss> and yes , that 's how come we 're married . <sssss> two -rrb- if you 're fat , why would you act so ... fat ? <sssss> it just reinforces the fact that you 're a great big fat person and what the hell ? <sssss> fat person code : -lrb- i am an authority -rrb- 1 . <sssss> do n't act like if you do n't get the exact pecan bar you want , that your life is over . <sssss> it may be true , but for fucks sake . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> do n't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke . <sssss> you get laughed at when you do this . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> i would say do diet and exercise but i 'm fat and i think those two things are profoundly boring . <sssss> anyway , i know this has dragged on but i talk so that i can hear myself talk , and the same generally applies to my writing . <sssss> but : if you are from lm , i hope you read this because ... our red -lrb- please see updated below -rrb- velvet cake last night was -lrb- sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame . <sssss> -rrb- terrible ** . <sssss> terrible ! <sssss> we got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving , or they should be fired . <sssss> i have -lrb- albeit indirect -rrb- experience with joe -lrb- the owner/conceptual mastermind -rrb- and i am certain that if he knew that this five day old , dried up piece of cake were being given to customers , he would be upset . <sssss> there were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and i told them they should get red velvet , hands down . <sssss> you made a liar out of me , liberty market ! <sssss> and for this , i wo n't forgive you unless i get a free slice of -lrb- do i even need to specify `` fresh '' -rrb- red velvet cake . <sssss> having said all of that , every restaurant has it 's moments , bad or good , and i forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else , i give lm five stars . <sssss> __________________ ** red velvet update : i have been in twice since and this most recent time , kiersten -lrb- one of the owners -rrb- gave me a new piece of red velvet cake . <sssss> and a pecan bar , from the middle of the pan no less ! <sssss> but i want to make this clear , just in case it is n't : i love liberty market -- it 's exceptional . <sssss> and i really want everyone to know that i 've had the rv cake many times before * and since * and it has , every time , been amazing . <sssss> i still hold that it is the best piece of cake i 've ever had . <sssss> so it clearly was an aberration this time . <sssss> and the carrot cake is almost as good . <sssss> really . <sssss> the bread pudding is totally sublime . <sssss> if you get a dessert there , you wo n't be disappointed . <sssss> i promise
?		while i am no thai expert , i do eat thai food a lot , and i can speak a little bit , and i 'll be going to thailand in december , so i think it stands to reason that i know what i 'm talking about . <sssss> thai elephant is delicious . <sssss> tom kah with tofu . <sssss> drunken noodles with tofu . <sssss> drunken fried rice with tofu . <sssss> yellow curry with tofu . <sssss> siamese basil with tofu . <sssss> all amazing . <sssss> i have been to the tempe location probably 20 times , and i like it better because 1 -rrb- i do n't have to feed the meter like at this downtown location 2 -rrb- the facilities are a little nicer 3 -rrb- its bigger and 4 -rrb- the service is a little better , but overall this location is pretty good . <sssss> cob coon , ka for reading !
?		i have been told about matt 's countless times and always heard about what a tiny place it was , but until i actually went for the first time , i never got the irony in the name `` matt 's big breakfast . '' <sssss> i was doped up on anesthesia , so i really enjoyed sitting at the window bar so i could people watch , and so that the other patrons could not watch my weird facial expressions . <sssss> for a vegetarian , the menu did not have a huge offering , but it was a clear choice for me : egg and cheese omelet with cheddar and provolone , hash-browns , sourdough toast and coffee . <sssss> ummm ... delicious !!!! <sssss> seriously , this breakfast was really awesome . <sssss> i might have gained five pounds from the butter it was all cooked in , but really , who cares . <sssss> the blackberry jam they happened to be serving that day was absolutely phenomenal , and i hate jam , so you know it must have been good . <sssss> i do n't know if they have a bathroom but it did not appear so . <sssss> as previously mentioned in probably every review and earlier in my review , this place is reallllly small . <sssss> the service was great . <sssss> they served our drinks , took our order and served our food quicker than i expected , especially since the place was packed the entire time . <sssss> the only thing that kept this place from being 5 stars was the coffee . <sssss> it just was n't good . <sssss> call me a coffee snob if you must .
?		i am writing an update because it does not get better than a freaking plate sized cheese stick . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> get the quesapilla . <sssss> it is a sopapilla filled with cheese . <sssss> that 's it . <sssss> your heart will hate you but your belly will love you . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> oh , and you can not beat a $ 9 pitcher of margaritas . <sssss> seriously .
?		so , i think we got off on the wrong foot . <sssss> i judged you too soon . <sssss> i 'm sorry . <sssss> knowing in advance to be careful with portion control , i had a much more affordable yogurt -lrb- $ 2.91 -rrb- and enjoyed it much more when i did not have one of every flavor sitting in my cup . <sssss> tonight i delighted in the non-dairy berry mixed with a little mint , topped with some captain crunch . <sssss> weird combo , i know . <sssss> but it worked . <sssss> the berry was a little tart , but the fact that i wont get stomach cramps from the dairy made up for it . <sssss> the mint was really refreshing and helped mellow out the tart berry flavor . <sssss> and who does n't love captain crunch ? <sssss> i still think the layout is a little off . <sssss> i finally found the sample cups so i got to sample both flavors in advance before committing . <sssss> thanks for the awesome customer service and the prompting on twitter to give you another shot .
?		this place is absolutely , positively perfect in every conceivable way . <sssss> why , you ask , is this place perfect in every conceivable way ? <sssss> well ... my friends ... let me tell you . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> big kahuna cab/shiraz mix wine - it costs three dollars and it is good . <sssss> like , i drink it all the time good . <sssss> three dollars ! <sssss> 2 . <sssss> cilantro lime hummus - you could dip paper in this and it would still be nectar of the gods . <sssss> still . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> no bullshit approach - you walk in , you get your shit , and you check yourself out . <sssss> i 'm not anti-social , but i really do n't like dealing with people , so this is perfect for me . <sssss> 4 . <sssss> they have exactly what you need , and nothing more . <sssss> 5 . <sssss> the clearance section is abundant . <sssss> i 'm a cheap bastard ; what can i say ? <sssss> 6 . <sssss> this f & e is literally 2 minutes from my house . <sssss> they close at 10pm , so when you are baking #thepie -lrb- vegan style richard !!!! <sssss> -rrb- at 9:55 pm at night and realize you are out of pecans , you can scoot on over , grab your nuts , and be back home by 10:01 pm . <sssss> 7 . <sssss> ummm ... duh , its fresh and its easy .
?		one time , before we became `` official , '' i walked into a uye at bomberos and gave dallas g a high five . <sssss> that 's right , instead of a hug or kiss on the cheek for the man who had graced the sheets of my bed many a times , he gets a high five . <sssss> it was awkward . <sssss> realllllyyyy awkward . <sssss> i 'm so smooth ... so , thank god bomberos has such a dope wine list and attentive service , because i most definitely needed the chilean riesling to take off the edge of that massacre ! <sssss> they have an amazing bruschetta plate , a tasty breakfast wrap , perfectly brewed illy coffees and they even let me bring in my own cake when it was chrissy p 's surprise party ! <sssss> the patio is amazing whether you want to lounge out on a sunday morning and read a book on the comfy patio furniture or sit with a romantic date by the fire . <sssss> i also hear that they have free wifi . <sssss> score ! <sssss> winner !! <sssss> -lrb- unlike me , who gives awkward high 5 's !!! <sssss> -rrb-
?		since the veggie house turned into loving hut , i have been twice , and am very delighted at some of the positive changes that have occurred . <sssss> the space itself is much lighter , and i feel more welcome by the staff . <sssss> i also like that their food selection is way less greasy and has more of a focus on health . <sssss> i have tried the spicy cha cha twice -lrb- it is actually yam protein breaded to look like shrimp -rrb- and it is fantastic . <sssss> i have also had the raw salad , sweet and sour pork , fried rice , one of the noodle soups , and the stuffed tomatoes . <sssss> all were good , but the stuffed tomatoes could have used a little more flavor . <sssss> great portion sizes . <sssss> they do not serve alcohol , but have some really fun concoctions to drink . <sssss> try the `` pink lady '' or the delightful `` sunny forest . ''
?		i really enjoyed lisa g 's . <sssss> i went with a bunch of other yelp-he 's and yelp-she 's after the last oye and was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> i have driven by several times and i love the logo and the sign , and used to live within walking distance , so it was on my list of places to visit . <sssss> i love the fact that lisa g is bopping around taking care of business . <sssss> i think that people who actually participate in the day-to-day operations of their business are doing it right . <sssss> everyone was really pleased with their meals , and i really enjoyed the taste of pizza i stole from my neighboring yelp-she . <sssss> i am definitely looking forward to hitting lisa g 's again and trying out some more tasty treats !
?		i have eaten at the veggie house several times . <sssss> the food is good , but the service is normally pretty slow . <sssss> do not head here if you are in a rush . <sssss> i normally get sweet and sour pork . <sssss> pretty tasty dish . <sssss> i have tried some other things , but did not particularly care for them . <sssss> this is predominantly asian based , and pretty heavy dishes .
?		if i liked beer , four peaks would be getting five stars . <sssss> -lrb- i will say they have a peach ale that is realllly tasty !! <sssss> -rrb- i wish i were my dad right now -lrb- that 's creepy , i know -rrb- because his cabinet shop is literally right next door and he frequents this joint at least once a week . <sssss> he has probably tried every beer and item on the menu over the past few years . <sssss> i have been to this four peaks probably four times now , and i have been really happy with everything i have eaten . <sssss> the 5-layer nachos -lrb- sofaking gooooodddd !! <sssss> -rrb- , spinach dip , pizza , hummus and even the veggie burger . <sssss> they pour a healthy vodka soda and the prices are reasonable . <sssss> service is a tiny bit slow , but it is tempe . <sssss> one of my favorite things about this location is that it is hidden from the world . <sssss> if you did n't know it was there , you would n't know it was there -lrb- i swear that makes sense in my head -rrb- . <sssss> i just wish they would allow you to bring dogs on the patio ! <sssss> if you ever get a spare moment , find dallas g and ask him to tell you his story about nachos . <sssss> it 's quite a tale told with so much fervor that you yourself might start believing in their power ... and if all of this was n't enough , it 's right next door to uranus studios -lrb- owned and operated by robin wilson of the goo goo dolls -rrb- so you may get to split bread with someone relatively famous in the 90 's !
?		i absolutely love kiss the cook . <sssss> it is the cutest little place for breakfast and i love going here . <sssss> the quaint little restaurant is decorated with country antiques and most of them are for sale . <sssss> it reminds me of a place you would find in prescott . <sssss> i have had a few things on the menu and have always been delighted . <sssss> the coffee is a little week , but then again , i start each day with a quad espresso so it may be unfair for me to judge . <sssss> while you wait for breakfast they bring out a variety of very tasty muffins and bread ... so , so tasty !!!! <sssss> good service and prices . <sssss> no complaints from me : -rrb-
?		the fact that i have yet to write my review of nami should be an insult to vegans and sweet lovers everywhere ! <sssss> nami , short for tsoynami , is heaven on earth . <sssss> or the moon . <sssss> jupiter . <sssss> wherever there is heaven , there is nami . <sssss> soy `` tsoft '' serve ice cream . <sssss> winkies . <sssss> snickerdoodles . <sssss> various cupcakes . <sssss> various cakes . <sssss> coffee with a choice of soy , almond , rice , and even hazelnut milk ! <sssss> although they have only done it once , nami is planning on running a regular sunday brunch in february . <sssss> i thought it was amazing when i went to the beta test . <sssss> multiple scramble options in addition to chilaquilles and other brunch creations . <sssss> do yourself a favor and stop by . <sssss> if not for the treats , for the awesome dancing and singing always taking place ! <sssss> ps ... cheddar and chive scone -lrb- thank me anytime -rrb-
?		this book store is absolutely amazing . <sssss> literally all of their books are half priced , but that does n't mean they are the sucky type of books you find in the clearance section of borders . <sssss> they do have an awesome $ 1 clearance section with a shit load of awesome books . <sssss> if you are a dean koontz fan , you will be in koontz heaven .
?		i can not stand this mall . <sssss> they have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious . <sssss> most of the people walking around are snooty as can be , and everything is overpriced . <sssss> the food court has some good selection , but is always super crowded and you can rarely find anywhere to sit . <sssss> parking is awful .
?		this is the exact place i love to hate . <sssss> but i ca n't . <sssss> i can not hate you , lodge . <sssss> i just ca n't ! <sssss> in fact , if this place did n't have taxidermied animals -lrb- yes , i just made a word up -rrb- and antler headpiece things as chandeliers , i would probably be giving this place 5 stars ... . <sssss> . <sssss> i know ! <sssss> i ca n't believe it either !! <sssss> my first experience with the lodge was as yelp bachelorette . <sssss> i was hammered -lrb- give me a break ; it was the most important day of my life so far -rrb- so i did n't think it was fair to review after not really `` being there , '' if you know what i mean . <sssss> my second experience was last night with the bachelor himself , dallas g . <sssss> yet again , the staff was incredibly friendly , quick with the service , and willing to accommodate my vegan , gluten free existence without fault . <sssss> they have an amazing black bean veggie burger and orgasm inducing sweet potato fries . <sssss> dg could learn a thing or two from those fries . <sssss> just kidding . <sssss> now , here is the best part of all : three dollar sky vodka drinks for the ladies . <sssss> you do n't need to know the rest .
?		i love sens a five star now . <sssss> i would say that there was a complete turnaround in 2.5 months . <sssss> service issues are fixed , they pour a mean vodka tonic , the wasabi tofu has maintained its amazing tastiness and i really like the location . <sssss> now if only i could get someone to make sweet sweet love to me in the bathroom .
?		i can not begin to explain the sheer excitement i feel knowing that i have yet to review bop . <sssss> i better take a deep breath ... ... in ... out ... in ... out ... okay , i 'm good . <sssss> i love this place and it is so unexpected ! <sssss> i went to watch a friends band play next door at chyro arts and they invited me to bop . <sssss> i agreed thinking i was going to be miserable . <sssss> but no . <sssss> not at all . <sssss> this place is a freaking gem . <sssss> their food is so freaking good . <sssss> the mac and cheese ... omg ... they have a bunch of food for veggies , which rules . <sssss> i see from other reviews that they have pub quizzes and i am going to have to hit that up one of these days . <sssss> the best part ? <sssss> they are at scotts/mcdowell , conveniently located 2 miles from my house . <sssss> oh , and the other best part , no yuppies . <sssss> only complaint ... the waitresses are a little slow .
?		oh mah gawd ! <sssss> normally i do n't * love * tamales because they are relatively dry , but when i saw the tamale store selling tamales at the downtown public market i just had to try one . <sssss> they have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert vegan options , and 5 vegetarian options . <sssss> so , i decided to get a hot southwest chipotle and ate it at the market , and got an additional 6 frozen ; a combo of southwest chipotle , pumpkin , and sweet corn . <sssss> well , these tamales are freaking delicious . <sssss> incredibly moist and flavorful , but with very few ingredients , and you can pronounce all of them ! <sssss> their website touts `` we use only the freshest produce and extra lean meats . <sssss> we never use lard or shortenings . <sssss> we never use preservatives !! '' <sssss> it is obviously true . <sssss> i love the tamale store !!!
?		oh baby ... oh , baby baby ... the original burrito co is 100 % amazing . <sssss> # 12 breakfast burrito . <sssss> the veggie mixito . <sssss> the cheese quesedilla . <sssss> the tostada . <sssss> oh , and how can you go wrong with a salsa bar ?!? <sssss> yummmm ! <sssss> i have an affinity for pay-at-the-counter mexican restaurants , and this one takes the cake .
?		great beer , great burger , great atmosphere . <sssss> they do what they do and they do it very well . <sssss> love the hefeweizen and the kilt lifter . <sssss> love the southwestern burger . <sssss> parking is not easy , had to park a couple blocks away . <sssss> did not love the 4 layer nachos but they were ok . <sssss> everything else was fantastic . <sssss> great place got ta try it .
?		after hearing several friends talk about the place son and i thought it would be an interesting place to take my wife for for mothers day . <sssss> we expected it to be crowded and it was . <sssss> i 'm not sure what i expected but it was not what what we found it was nice but not great . <sssss> we ordered some sandwiches which were pretty good and because of the heat we ate them inside . <sssss> there were others that ate outside but because of the heat no one looked comfortable . <sssss> there was a band that was playing , which was nice , but it was too hot to enjoy them . <sssss> they had a coffee bar and gelato stand that we did not try . <sssss> there was a wine tasting , which was nice , but the wines were all pretty bad . <sssss> there were lots of items to purchase but everything was way overpriced . <sssss> you kind of had the feeling that you were in a tourist trap . <sssss> the have an olive oil tasting area but they do not provide bread , they claim it changes the taste of the oil . <sssss> the make you pour the oil into little paper cups and drink it straight up -lrb- yech -rrb- . <sssss> since no one drinks olive oil straight up i think that you are better off seeing how it tastes on bread . <sssss> if nothing else it eliminates the yech factor . <sssss> we went on the $ 5 tour , did not expect much , and got even less . <sssss> the tour consisted of going out the side door , having someone collect our tour tickets , going in another side door , sitting down in front of an olive crushing machine that was not operating and having someone tell us how olive oil is made and all the things that we could spend our money on . <sssss> they should change the word `` tour '' to `` lecture '' or `` sales pitch '' , as we saw nothing . <sssss> we did get to taste 2-4 olives however . <sssss> in summary i am glad we went , and it will be on the list if we have visitors and ca n't think of anything better to do . <sssss> it is overpriced , a bit of a tourist trap , but that said it is worth doing once .
?		i can tell i 'm getting old . <sssss> i go to restaurants for the food not because it is the thing to do . <sssss> i met some friends at the true foods because they heard good things . <sssss> a lot of beautiful people were eating there . <sssss> looked like a beautiful people convention some of the beauty was natural but much of it was surgically enhanced . <sssss> everyone ordered a $ 4 juice soda mix that was ok but small and not -lrb- imho -rrb- worth $ 4 . <sssss> everyone got there meal at a different time -lrb- 10 minutes between the first and the last -rrb- and that was a bit awkward . <sssss> my wife had the kale salad and i had the fish taco 's . <sssss> wife thought the salad was ok but expensive for what she got . <sssss> i got 3 fish tacos and each one consisted of a nugget sized piece of fish on a small and dry -lrb- it broke apart when you tried to bend it making it hard to eat -rrb- corn tortillas that with some fresh veggie garnish on it . <sssss> i tasted ok but i love fish taco 's and i can say these are the worst i have ever had . <sssss> it appears the food is fresh , they use great ingredients , and it is a good place to see and be seen . <sssss> but after paying $ 52 for a couple of small drinks some chopped kale with a little bit of dressing and a couple of other things , 3 fish nuggets on dry tortillas , and a couple of cups of coffee , and marginal service i do n't think i will be going back .
?		my sister and i ate here exactly a month ago . <sssss> it is under new ownership and is so much better ! <sssss> the old owners were rude and service was very sloppy and bad . <sssss> my sister and i each ordered the same item - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich . <sssss> my sister had coffee and i ordered a mocha to go right after we paid . <sssss> the staff was friendly . <sssss> the food was very good . <sssss> we will be coming back again to try other menu items . <sssss> the only reason i did not give them 5 stars was because . <sssss> i ordered the mocha to go after we finished our meal . <sssss> it took 20 minutes for them to prepare and bring me the mocha . <sssss> i did not know that it seriously would take someone that long to make a mocha ! <sssss> starbucks makes a mocha when u go through the drive thru in less than 4 minutes ... ...
?		the blue moose is a fun place to go to hang out with friends and enjoy some good conversation and some decent food . <sssss> i have been going off and on to the `` moose '' for almost 6 years . <sssss> the staff is friendly and the service is great and the food is average for being a bar . <sssss> try the crispy chicken wrap if you are a fan of chicken . <sssss> it has this tasty sauce , lettuce , tomato , and cheese as well as warm chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla . <sssss> i like it because you do not have to get the chicken fried if you do not care for the extra calories . <sssss> they offer it grilled if you request it and it is good either way ! <sssss> the outdoor patio is a nice place to sit and relax when we are beyond the summer months . <sssss> this place is a bar but not very crowded the majority of the time and a nice place to go to have a nice romantic evening with your honey or just hang with your buddies over some ice cold beers . <sssss> the place is only loud during the month of march when spring training is taking place . <sssss> yes , please bring back the shuffleboard table . <sssss> i miss it also and it was a popular gaming piece for all to play and enjoy !
?		duke 's is my place to grab some lunch when i want to get away from the same old grind of a sandwich . <sssss> the food is okay and has always been fresh when i have eaten here with co-workers . <sssss> the hot wings , burgers , sandwiches , and salads are all pretty good ! <sssss> it is a sports bar so if you are wanting to do an intimate lunch or want to speak without having to raise your voice a bit . <sssss> this would not be the place for you . <sssss> if you are a sports junkie than this is the perfect place for you to come and relax and watch various sports on there 15 + televisions and have a cold beer .
?		i went here today with a buddy of mine for lunch and it was definitely a very good meal . <sssss> overall quality was pretty damn good . <sssss> the thing i loved the best about this place was that they have duck on the buffet line !! <sssss> i have never seen this before and i love duck !! <sssss> the sushi was ok , nothing spectacular , but i did n't expect anything less for buffet sushi . <sssss> would i go back ? <sssss> yeah , i would go back .
?		i have been eying this place for quite some time now considering one of my best friends has checked in here 28 times , and one of my other friends just discovered it and was ranting about it . <sssss> so last night i had to give it a whirl . <sssss> do n't be thrown off by the building itself . <sssss> yes , it looks like a dive that would serve crumby food , but alas inside great things are being done ! <sssss> i had the classic gyro . <sssss> delicious !! <sssss> perfectly seasoned meat , a fantastic pita and fresh vegetables . <sssss> what 's not to love ? <sssss> you have the option of having either a salad or fries with your meal . <sssss> i went with the french fries . <sssss> these fries are deceptively good !! <sssss> they look like your typical frozen fries , which they are but somehow they are great and are seasoned with season salt , always a plus . <sssss> man am i salivating right now just thinking about it . <sssss> i would like to add that this place is value for its buck . <sssss> the portions are huge and appropriately priced . <sssss> i will be back for sure and sooner than later !!
?		i came here on saturday night for my first time . <sssss> i would describe smashburger as elevated fast food , almost chipotle like in design . <sssss> it was a very nicely decorated facility and the service was great . <sssss> a pretty expansive menu for this type of place . <sssss> a variety of burgers , salads , and other types of sandwiches . <sssss> a lot of sides are offered as well . <sssss> they bring the food to your table and have real utensils . <sssss> the downside of this place was the food was meh . <sssss> it was n't terrible , but it was n't great . <sssss> but what i paid for the food i really ca n't complain . <sssss> i can easily oversee coming here again , but if i 'm in a pinch i will go back .
?		this whole complex is great ! <sssss> if the dbacks were to actually play regular season games here , i 'd be more inclined to go to because i do not like chase field . <sssss> just walking up to the actual stadium you walk right by numerous playing fields , and batting cages and at any given time you can watch the teams practice . <sssss> the aesthetics of this place is really clean . <sssss> not a bad seat in the house and it 's cheap ! <sssss> my only complaint and i 'm nit picking because i 'm a traditionalist when it comes to ball park food . <sssss> i do n't want to see mexican and chinese cuisine . <sssss> that 's not baseball !!
?		i love when my preconceptions are proved wrong . <sssss> i have actually heard a lot about this place and i know what pho is but actually never tried it until yesterday . <sssss> walking up to this place , you have the misconception that this place will not be that good because it is on the end of a run down strip mall and you think to yourself if the outside looks likes this how good could it be inside ? <sssss> much to my amazement , my ignorance turned to bliss . <sssss> upon walking in the inside was much bigger than i thought it was going to to be , it was packed and everything was very clean , a pleasant surprise . <sssss> i ordered the shrimp spring rolls and the pho , that consisted of tripe , meatball , and brisket . <sssss> the spring rolls were divine . <sssss> nice crisp , fresh , clean , and aromatic flavors . <sssss> i could have ate about eight of these things . <sssss> upon finishing the spring rolls , i knew it was a sign of good things to come . <sssss> then came the pho . <sssss> realistically , pho is a soup , and i did n't understand how a soup could be perceived at phenomenal . <sssss> once again i was wrong . <sssss> i tried the broth first , a mouth full of deliciousness . <sssss> the rice noodles were divine , the meatball i thought was ok though , and the brisket was a little tough , but that is too be expected when it 's sitting in hot broth all day . <sssss> but overall a more than solid bowl of awesomeness , and i was a happy camper . <sssss> what element i think i loved the most was that the pho was filling , but you do n't feel like you overate . <sssss> a filling meal that has a very light touch to it , which i enjoy . <sssss> the service was a little clumsy , but i can oversee that , since they delivered on the meal which is what were really there for . <sssss> i 'm am going to stick with giving this place a four star rating simply due to the fact that i have never had pho before yesterday and i do n't know whether or not i have had the cream of the crop , or if there is better pho in the valley . <sssss> i guess i will have to try more pho elsewhere , but i will be back to pho thanh .
?		i came here for a pre dinner drink before going to fnb . <sssss> my date and i went in and went straight to the bar . <sssss> i 'm not going to bitch because i was n't greeted by anyone , i could care less . <sssss> we sat at the bar , and sat , and sat . <sssss> numerous servers walked by with no type of acknowledgment or to even maybe get the bartender . <sssss> the bartender finally came and showed no interest in serving us . <sssss> after enjoying our drinks i asked to close out my tab . <sssss> that took 20 minutes . <sssss> it was only my company and myself and two other patrons at the bar . <sssss> i gave my card as soon as he brought the check . <sssss> it actually took so long that i left my friend at the bar to sign my name so i could run down and go to fnb so they did n't think i was bailing on my reservation . <sssss> now i 'm not being overly sensitive , i 'm just pointing out that this was piss poor service and exactly opposite of how the hospitality business should be run . <sssss> based on my experience on just trying to get a drink , i have no desire to actually come here and try the food .
?		ok i do n't understand america 's recent craze with cupcakes . <sssss> the show cupcake wars and i have heard so many grand things about sprinkles . <sssss> i had today off and i decided i had to see what the whole cupcake buzz is about . <sssss> when i walked in there was a line about 30 people deep . <sssss> i was like ok have these people never had a cupcake before ? <sssss> anyways , i walk in and i could n't tell if i was in a pseudo bakery or a fashion show/salon setting ? <sssss> nothing about this place reflects a bakery . <sssss> so i ordered a red velvet cupcake and i guess waitress you would call it wrote up a ticket for it . <sssss> ok , it is one cupcake , apparently the ticket is for tracking product , i do n't know . <sssss> then i had to wait at least a solid 3 minutes before they gave it to me . <sssss> i had the cash in my hand . <sssss> ca n't it be a grab and go ? <sssss> apparently no !! <sssss> as for the cupcake itself , the structural integrity was totaled f * cked . <sssss> it was so top heavy that the top was breaking off from the bottom . <sssss> it was obvious that it was n't freshly frosted because the frosting had the hard crust , like it was a done a day before and sat on a shelf for numerous hours . <sssss> but i will say that the cream cheese frosting did taste good . <sssss> as far as the cake , the taste was pleasant . <sssss> light and airy cake . <sssss> overall the cupcake was pretty darn good . <sssss> with all that being said i 'm glad i tried one . <sssss> would i wait in line for 15 minutes again ? <sssss> not unless i had an undying insatiable craze for one , which i do n't see happening . <sssss> yes it is better than any supermarket cupcake that i have ever had , but i 'm more than happy getting a hostess cupcake at any convenience store for cheap than paying $ 3.81 for one single cupcake . <sssss> props to the lady who invented sprinkles for the business that she created but after all , it 's just a god damn cupcake !!
?		gigantic bar , good hh spot . <sssss> extensive menu with standard bar fare . <sssss> starters outshine the entrees . <sssss> nachos , boneless buffalo wings , onion rings were decent . <sssss> pass on the hummus plate . <sssss> good service , but would probably just return for large draft selection .
?		3.5 stars - overall pleased , would adopt as a happy hr . <sssss> standby , rated downward b/c food was decent , not raveworthy . <sssss> quite pleasantly surprised to discover this airy , spacious resto-lounge in scottsdale fashion sq. . <sssss> stopped in during happy hr . <sssss> on a thursday , decent mix of patrons . <sssss> overall space is versatile and occasion-friendly , great alfresco feel as giant oak doors were opened to the outdoor patio . <sssss> lounge is perfect for small parties with low couches and leather sofa chair seating . <sssss> great happy hr . <sssss> specials -lrb- m-f 4-6pm -rrb- $ 5 small plates , well drinks , house wine , sangria . <sssss> prosciutto bruschetta w/crescenza cheese , arugula & fig preserves was perfectly balanced . <sssss> italian sausage flatbread w/pequillo peppers & goat cheese - the peppers and goat cheese made this flatbread , the sausage was overly crumbled and did n't add much flavor . <sssss> the cheese plate was fine - a mild blue and a mild spanish cheese , plated with thinly sliced apples , marinated in a fruit jam . <sssss> apparently , they 're serving a $ 20 3-course prix-fixe w/several interesting options through 10/31 . <sssss> menu here : http://www.foxrc.com/downloads/menus/o&i_prix_fixe_menu.pdf cons : white -lrb- pink -rrb- sangria was prettily presented sugar-rimmed , but served sans fruit -lrb- odd -rrb- . <sssss> have had much better sangria . <sssss> service was spotty but potentially b/c bartender was doubling as our server , other servers ended up busing our table and were helpful . <sssss> look forward to checking out other fox concepts true food kitchen and zinburger .
?		yum . <sssss> delish , fresh hand-pulled noodles . <sssss> parents are from taipei , and this passed their verdict as well . <sssss> pick your noodles -lrb- original/sho lah , knife-shaved/dao hsiao , among others -rrb- , meat -lrb- lamb , chicken , beef , beef tendon -rrb- , and preparation -lrb- broth , pan-fried -rrb- . <sssss> of note , the noodle broth comes with cilantro and pickled vegetables , which some may prefer to order without . <sssss> highly recommend the dao hsiao - is as good as the quality you 'd find in l.a. wish this were in chicago .
?		there is nothing to say that has n't been said . <sssss> if you like good wine , food and service check out postino . <sssss> i would recommend the bruschetta and the roasted beet salad .
?		mediocre to the max with bad service to boot ! <sssss> i 've given this place a handful of tries and i just ca n't seem to find anything i like . <sssss> the service is probably the worst part . <sssss> waiting 10 minutes for sushi rolls that are clearly ready and waiting to be served is not acceptable . <sssss> i feel bad for the waitresses - every time i am in they seem to be running around like crazy . <sssss> the food is pretty horrible too . <sssss> i can say the asian chicken salad is pretty good but the rice bowls and sushi are all not good .
?		went back . <sssss> still amazing . <sssss> i ate kangaroo !!!!
?		the food has really gone downhill . <sssss> i used to go here all the time when i lived on that side of town but the last few times i 've gone the sushi was horrible . <sssss> maybe it was an off day ? <sssss> i might venture back to see if this was the case .
?		this is a nice place -- the service is normally good and the staff is very friendly . <sssss> the location is great because it is walking distance for some of the offices in the area and there are not many other offerings unless you want to hoof it all the way down to scottsdale rd. . <sssss> the doubletree wally 's is also in what i consider to be a cursed location . <sssss> there have been several restaurants in and out of there that have all failed spectacularly . <sssss> i approached wally 's with caution but i was rewarded with great food and great service . <sssss> they are sometimes slow , and a couple of their menu items are questionable -lrb- some shredded bbq burger nightmare comes to mind -rrb- , which is my only reason for not giving 5 stars . <sssss> the fish and chips are fab . <sssss> they also have a take-away menu of salads and sandwiches that are ready to go by the front door if you work in the area and forgot your lunch . <sssss> they 're above average and a great value . <sssss> forget subway or paradise bakery !
?		overall very happy with this location . <sssss> i will say straight away that they do have some growing pains -- the location has been very popular right from the start and it takes a lot of work to grease all the cogs and get a very busy restaurant working properly . <sssss> the food has been very good -- the service slightly lacking . <sssss> it seems that they should have put more focus on hiring experienced food service workers rather `` cool '' or `` cute '' people . <sssss> i do encourage anyone to try it out -- just have a little patience because while the big picture is good , there are `` little things '' that you need to look past to have a good time . <sssss> just give them feedback if something is missed , and they will make it right .
?		this place is great and a lot of fun . <sssss> we ventured over here on a whim because we were waiting for a show at the rhythm room across the way and the traditional rack shack bbq was closed and locked . <sssss> the decor is quite fantastic and this little joint has a cool vibe . <sssss> i was a bit guarded because it looks like the kind of place that might spring cheesy ed debevic 's antics on you at any minute . <sssss> but . <sssss> . <sssss> the guys were just cool . <sssss> one of the guys in my party is on a low-carb diet and the proprietor was very accommodating , making menu suggestions and whatnot . <sssss> i got the magic mushroom burger , another person ordered the fat ass burger but what ended up in the bag was the hot ass burger , and the low-carb person got a greek burger with no bun . <sssss> we all got the meal deal which is simply phenomenal at the $ 5 price point . <sssss> you ca n't even get a crappy meal at mcd 's for that price any more . <sssss> the burgers were absolutely awesome , and the fries were perfect . <sssss> there are bar stools inside and out in the the front . <sssss> if you go around back , there are a couple larger booths by the parking lot . <sssss> i would n't go back there again because a lot of people were standing around smoking and there was some tough-guy `` oh yeah ? <sssss> well i 'll kick your ass ! '' <sssss> exchange going on behind the business next door . <sssss> give it a rest , guys . <sssss> the proprietor did come around back and ask us how everything was , which was cool . <sssss> i 'd recommend to anyone .
?		hoooolllllly cripes on a popsicle stick . <sssss> ever eat a full-course meal and then want to start all over again because it was just that damned good ? <sssss> this place is a home run in every sense . <sssss> not just a regular home run , but one of the ones where the ball shatters the stadium lights and robert redford is running the bases with sparks falling everywhere . <sssss> i honestly do n't even remember every bit of what was consumed . <sssss> it was a blur of pure delight . <sssss> there were these delicious peppers in cream sauce and tomatoes with goat cheese for appetizers . <sssss> oh , man . <sssss> i could 've eaten those until the act was criminalized . <sssss> at some point corn on the cob with parmesan appeared . <sssss> then entrees came . <sssss> i had the halibut -lrb- yes , you can get insanely fresh seafood in phoenix , it 's a myth that you can not -rrb- . <sssss> it was so perfect and firm and tasteful ... others got the lamb and it was sinful . <sssss> you have to literally find a wooden booth and go to confession after eating it . <sssss> i 'm available for light penance if you ca n't find willing clergy . <sssss> anyway , the desserts . <sssss> i 'm not a dessert-ordering person , but we got puddings and cakes and i wanted them all in my mouth immediately now . <sssss> we polished everything off and i seriously wanted the menu back so i could start again . <sssss> the drinks ! <sssss> the drinks were off the hook . <sssss> we tried ordering mint juleps but the bartender had other things in mind . <sssss> he had invented a variation on the mint julep and would we care to try it ? <sssss> of course we would . <sssss> oh , it was game on . <sssss> so tasty . <sssss> also , the ambiance here is just killer . <sssss> the kitchen is right there in the middle of everything ... and it 's the quietest , most efficient kitchen i 've ever seen . <sssss> ever watch those reality shows where everyone is shouting in the kitchen ? <sssss> how long till the risotto is done and whatnot ? <sssss> i did n't hear a peep from those geniuses all night . <sssss> they just toiled back there and pumped miracles all night . <sssss> also , most of the ingredients for everything made are local ! <sssss> get thee to fnb .
?		despite working about a mile away from this place for 7 years , i 've never gone inside , mostly because i 'm scared of places that are the only operational business in an entire plaza of empty stalls . <sssss> i always think they must be moving counterfeit matchbox cars out the back door or something . <sssss> but , i was at pavilions for the car show and we decided to go to this joint . <sssss> the hostess was super friendly , and set us up to go down the line . <sssss> tons of raw meats , very cold or frozen , and tons of fresh veggies and sauces . <sssss> there is a huge board that tells you how to mix up various kinds of sauce . <sssss> you can really pack a lot of meat and toppings into those bowls , even if you get the `` regular '' . <sssss> and do n't worry about mounding it on there , because it all reduces when they cook it . <sssss> it is true that they throw water on the grill while cooking and i think this must temper the taste somewhat . <sssss> i put tons of garlic on mine and i barely tasted it when i got back to the table . <sssss> so , minus one star for that . <sssss> but i 'd rather water than butter , which is what you get at some places . <sssss> the price includes a drink , rice , soup , and some different toppings they have available after your stuff is cooked . <sssss> we left stuffed and happy , so it 's all good .
?		i ca n't speak to the various deluxe and mixed concoctions available here , but the basic drip coffee is excellent . <sssss> every time i 've been here i order just a drip coffee , black . <sssss> if you add cream and sugar you are going to sully the taste of whatever beans they use -- they are literally among the best i 've had . <sssss> even if you hate drinking black coffee , i recommend it at least once . <sssss> the atmosphere at lola is very laid back and welcoming . <sssss> there are always available tables when i go in , and everything is kept clean and tidy . <sssss> i have been to other coffee shops downtown in which this is definitely not the case -lrb- difficult to find a table , messes left out , etc. -rrb- if you are in the area looking for a good cup , check it out . <sssss> it is right next store to pita jungle as well , so might be a good destination for after-meal joe .
?		an update is long overdue , since i originally rated arriba two stars . <sssss> i 've been back a few times since , and they have really made a lot of strides toward improving the food and the service . <sssss> the servers are more `` on '' these days , the food is better , and the overall experience is more satisfying . <sssss> tonight i had the hatch chicken especial , which is extraordinarily spicy -lrb- it 's the spiciest dish they make -rrb- and really damned tasty . <sssss> pair it with an amber or bock microbrew to temper the spiciness somewhat .
?		in me and my friend 's minds , this is the best pizza place in phoenix metro . <sssss> i 'm surprised to hear that people feel that the food is not good and overpriced and that they have gotten horrible service . <sssss> the food : the pizza here is amazing . <sssss> top quality fresh ingredients . <sssss> anybody who says otherwise probably does n't have a mature palette . <sssss> yes , if you are looking for a standard , greasy nyc pizza , go to slices around the corner . <sssss> -lrb- which is also good , just different . <sssss> -rrb- however , if you are looking for a fresh meal that you can leave feeling good , go here . <sssss> the price : i think this place is well priced for what you get - fresh ingredients that complement each other . <sssss> if you are n't full after eating here and think it is too pricey because of your unfulfilled appetite , i have two things to say . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> you need to reduce your portions - my husband and i can share a pizza here and be full . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> you need to understand that price is n't always based on quantity , but quality . <sssss> the service : every time i go to this place , the servers -lrb- not just the one waiting my table -rrb- are always amazing . <sssss> in fact , they are so good you would think they were the owner . <sssss> on top of being prompt , they always are very descriptive and helpful .
?		yum ! <sssss> the food here is always good and it 's a decent price . <sssss> the owner is really nice and always makes sure that your experience is wonderful . <sssss> i always get something with gyro meat and it 's usually great . <sssss> during lunch rush , sometimes the gryo meat is not cooked at long . <sssss> it 's still good , just has n't had the chance to capture as much flavor because they go through so much meat . <sssss> yea , the decor inside is n't my style , but i 've certainly seen way worse in other greek restaurants . <sssss> overall , one of my favorite places to go for greek food .
?		this is a really great library and probably the best in phoenix ! <sssss> among the beautiful architectural elements , this place has a pretty descent selection of books and music . <sssss> there are different levels of the building that gives a great separation . <sssss> there are lots of areas that allow you to sit a read all the different books . <sssss> there is also a really cool teenager room that provides a cool hangout for all the young folks . <sssss> have n't had any bad experiences yet . <sssss> overall a great place to go !
?		this place is pretty cool . <sssss> it 's a real chill atmosphere and there are n't an overwhelming amount of people there -lrb- which i like ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i showed up to meet some friends on a friday night . <sssss> the inside is great , there is a big horse , a small stage , and a bar maned by a fun staff . <sssss> the decor is n't fancy , but it has character . <sssss> a band was setting up getting ready to play . <sssss> i would have loved to hear them , but my friends were outside so i headed there . <sssss> outside there is a big patio . <sssss> it was a little chilly , so there was a fire goin ' in the firepit . <sssss> there was also a musician outside , so i was n't missing out on entertainment . <sssss> she was playing calm , folk acoustic , making the mood of the night even better . <sssss> the group of 7 that i was with were able to sit comfortably , there was plenty of room . <sssss> we enjoyed good conversation over the music and were n't bothered by wanna-be types trying to be cool . <sssss> all of the customers and staff there seemed very down to earth . <sssss> great atmosphere , decent prices , and cool people .
?		yum yum yum ! <sssss> i love this place 's breakfast burrito and their carne asada . <sssss> for some reason , the first time i went to the 7th st location , i did n't like it . <sssss> however , i came back after about 6 months and now i am addicted ! <sssss> i do prefer this location over the 7th street for some reason . <sssss> this location seems to have a nicer staff . <sssss> plus it 's close to some really awesome antique shops ! <sssss> makes for a great pre-antiquing breakfast !
?		all i can say is , i really hope this place was having a bad day . <sssss> i was really hoping this place would be good . <sssss> i loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go ... but i guess not . <sssss> when you first walk in , there is no real clear direction as to where you go to order . <sssss> i walked up to where they were making sandwiches for another customer and stood there . <sssss> there were two people behind the counter making sandwiches . <sssss> one left to ring a customer up and came back . <sssss> all along , for the 5 minutes i was standing there , nobody said `` we 'll be right with you '' , `` hello '' , nothing . <sssss> i did n't even get eye contact , but i suppose that would have meant they would have had to say something . <sssss> i finally got an `` are you ready ? '' <sssss> , which as a side note i thought was somewhat rude . <sssss> you ca n't even give me a `` hello . <sssss> how may i help you ? '' <sssss> just an `` are you ready ? '' <sssss> as if i had been making him wait a long time before making my decision . <sssss> no ... i was waiting on you . <sssss> but i digress . <sssss> i ordered and decided to get my sandwich to go because the environment was n't much to look at and it felt claustrophobic . <sssss> the food meh and made with what seemed like bagged bread . <sssss> you can look at my photos to see what i got . <sssss> i think they speak for themselves .
?		if the food is terrible when you are drunk late at night , then you know something is wrong . <sssss> this past weekend i went to this place for the final time . <sssss> i 've had their cheesesteaks a number of times now and they have gotten worse and worse with less and less meat . <sssss> i am from the philly area , so i 'd say i know my cheesesteaks pretty well and these are not good cheesesteaks . <sssss> i really hate giving 1 star reviews , but this place deserves it after the food they have provided late at night . <sssss> also , the fries are without a doubt the worst fries i 've ever had . <sssss> the best thing this place has going for it is the bread , which is good , but not great . <sssss> if the food is n't bad enough for you , then enjoy dealing with the world 's worst/annoying drunk people . <sssss> i 'd normally look the other way , grin and bear the obnoxious patrons at that hour , but when you have a dj spinning records after hours you are attracting some of the worst scum this side of the central arizona project . <sssss> i was hoping for so much more with this place , but it has let me down time and time again . <sssss> hey philadelphia sandwich company , where 's the beef ?!? <sssss> from now on , i 'm sticking with pizza for my late night eats in old town . <sssss> the end .
?		after attending this year 's burger battle and speaking with lindsey f. about how great lobby 's burgers are , this place has been on my radar for a while now . <sssss> i do n't get to tempe very often , but when i did , i was going to be sure to give lobby 's a try . <sssss> i finally got there yesterday and lindsey was true to her word , because they made a really tasty burger . <sssss> would i rank it # 1 on my best burgers in phoenix list ? <sssss> no , but it will certainly make the list ! <sssss> i ordered a bacon cheese burger with cheddar . <sssss> one thing that disappointed me was that they do n't offer american cheese , but cheddar will do . <sssss> the burger came out hot , cheesy , and smothered in their homemade sauce . <sssss> it was very similar to in n ' out 's style , but with a bigger burger -lrb- 1/3lb -rrb- . <sssss> the burger was a perfect combination of salty and sweet . <sssss> they also offer a burger challenge for some crazy gluttonous patrons to try out . <sssss> you have only 10 minutes to eat a nonuple cheeseburger and get your photo on their wall of fame . <sssss> otherwise , it 'll set you back $ 30 . <sssss> i personally think 10 minutes is ridiculous . <sssss> 15 minutes would be fair . <sssss> all is all , forget the challenge and get yourself a normal cheeseburger . <sssss> you 'll be very satisfied !
?		this is my new favorite place to go to at the new city scape in downtown phoenix . <sssss> the food , drinks , music , and atmosphere are all great . <sssss> copper blues is the perfect decision for pre-show drinks and dinner . <sssss> the restaurant is attached to the stand up live comedy club and this past weekend my girlfriend and i met up with another couple at the restaurant before seeing stephen rannazzisi . <sssss> for an appetizer we all really enjoyed the french onion dip with some bbq potato chips , despite my girlfriend 's hesitation to order this dish since it was `` something you can easily pick up at the grocery store . '' <sssss> for the main course three of us got the copper blues burger , which has cheddar cheese , hickory bacon , roasted onions and tomato jam . <sssss> usually i 'd do without the tomato jam , but i figured the hell with it and kept it on . <sssss> i ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection . <sssss> i have to say , i was n't expecting it , but i was blown away by this burger and i 'm definitely adding it to my list of best burgers in phoenix . <sssss> my friend 's wife had the caprese sandwich . <sssss> pretty standard , but it looked very good . <sssss> all sandwiches came with a side of their house made bbq chips , which we all ended up using to dip in the left over french onion dip . <sssss> for the beer aficionados there are over 60 beers on tap . <sssss> check out their extensive list here : http://copperblueslive.com/page.cfm?id=1028 me ? <sssss> i 'll take a coors light .
?		upon arriving at phoenix municipal stadium i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this facility . <sssss> it was easy to get to from the 202 , easy parking -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , and a nice view of the papago rocks over the left field wall . <sssss> the one disappointment was there is n't any lawn seating . <sssss> home to the oakland a 's , phoenix municipal stadium will give you a chance to see manny try and make a return to baseball before the rest of the country does during the regular season . <sssss> not a bad draw .
?		i 've been wanting to try the parlor for months and i finally got to on friday for date night with my girlfriend . <sssss> i 've heard so many good things about this place so i was expecting greatness , but worried i would be disappointed due to all the hype . <sssss> i was not disappointed . <sssss> i am going to rank the parlor fourth on my favorite pizza places list in the valley of the sun , but i can see it possibly moving up a notch or two after more visits . <sssss> i 'd like to give the parlor 4.5 if i could . <sssss> i had a sausage pizza with garlic and basil . <sssss> my girlfriend had a pepperoni pizza with garlic and basil . <sssss> both were outstanding . <sssss> the sauce was great and the cheddar and mozzarella mix was very nice . <sssss> next time i think i 'll get a pizza with pepperoni and sausage with garlic and basil . <sssss> another nice thing , they do n't charge for the fresh garlic and basil -lrb- or any other herbs -rrb- , unlike some of my other favorite phoenix pizza places . <sssss> the overall prices were very reasonable for a 12 '' pie . <sssss> i definitely plan on becoming a repeat customer of this fine establishment and it wo n't take me months to do so .
?		one of the only chinese places i like in the valley . <sssss> i always go with the # 12 lunch combo , the chicken and broccoli . <sssss> it is delicious and the spring rolls are great too . <sssss> i highly recommend siu wok if you 're looking for a chinese fix during lunch .
?		one of the best spring training sites , second only to salt river fields in my opinion . <sssss> scottsdale stadium is home to the sf giants and is the best location of all the stadiums . <sssss> it has a great seating and lawn area . <sssss> post game day drinking is always in order when at this old town ball field . <sssss> food is good , great people watching , and oh yeah , the baseball games ! <sssss> does it get any better than scottsdale in march ? <sssss> i submit that it does not ! <sssss> i 'll have to be honest though , ever since salt river fields opened up in 2011 , i have n't been to scottsdale stadium . <sssss> maybe it 's just because it is closer , but i am digging on the vibe at srf more these days . <sssss> still , you wo n't go wrong with picking a game at scottsdale stadium . <sssss> another added bonus about this place , they have the fall league games here as well . <sssss> good place to see up and coming stars .
?		yay , a hole-in-the-wall mexican joint that 's vegetarian-friendly ! <sssss> my kid and i loved the -lrb- homemade ? <sssss> -rrb- horchata , sediment and all -- even better that its served punchbowl -lrb- punchbucket ? <sssss> -rrb- - style . <sssss> i had the bean and cheese burrito , served some special style with raw onions and tapatio sauce inside . <sssss> tasty ! <sssss> because we do n't hit that area of town much and i did n't know when we 'd be back , i tried the corn as well , with all the fixin 's , that is , lime , cheese , cream -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- and tapatio . <sssss> not really my taste , but it was the most elaborate corn-on-the-cob i 've seen . <sssss> my kid was happy with the bean burrito too , sans the onions and sauce . <sssss> my wife had a quesadilla with grilled onions . <sssss> it was a little small , but looked good and she seemed to like it . <sssss> she loved one of their flavored margaritas , the maroon one with a funny name that starts with a j . <sssss> we also all shared the chips , salsa and guac . <sssss> not a fan of creamy guac , i stuck with the salsa , which i loved , but my wife , a guacamole connoisseur , really liked it . <sssss> we 'll be back ...
?		fantastic pizza and smiling service . <sssss> i 'm pretty sure that mr. bianco 's special ingredient is love .
?		took my girl to @localbreeze for her birthday last night -lrb- not that it 's a celebration-type restaurant , more that it 's a quaint downtown spot without a wait and decent outdoor seating -rrb- . <sssss> it was our second time there and we had a great time . <sssss> they 're pretty light on vegetarian faire : -lrb- , but i enjoyed the hummus and lavash -lrb- minus the bacon -rrb- . <sssss> they make a decent margarita too . <sssss> our guests enjoyed the spicy shrimp appetizer . <sssss> a peach-flavored , creamy cocktail was delivered to our table by the bartender -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- along with an apology -lrb- apparently many order it and expect something else -rrb- , but the drinker said it was great . <sssss> the outdoor seating is very casual and southern-feeling ; misters were appreciated .
?		this is the best pita jungle and it 's not just because they have a full bar . <sssss> the waitstaff seems to care more about your experience much more than the other valley locations . <sssss> i recommend the lentil fetoosh salad and the lavosh pizza -lrb- ? <sssss> -- may have the name wrong , but it 's not to be confused with the lavosh pita , which is n't nearly as good -rrb- . <sssss> even the cheap house margaritas are good .
?		i admit i 'm not a huge bbq fan , as it usually makes me feel like exploding afterwards but since my dining partner loves bbq , we 've eaten here a lot . <sssss> the meat is pretty good but at least one of the meats has been dry each time i 've been . <sssss> my favorite has been the ham . <sssss> the spicy bbq sauce is pretty darn tasty too . <sssss> i 've found myself putting black pepper on the mac and cheese to spice it up and have n't been all that impressed with the rest of their sides either . <sssss> i 'm a big fan of sides at bbq places , even more than the meat , so when sides disappoint i get sad . <sssss> : -lrb- i dumped out their homemade root beer after one sip . <sssss> do n't know what was about it but it was very * off for me , and i seriously love root beer . <sssss> my dining partner loved it so ehhh ... maybe it 's just me . <sssss> the place is very interesting on the inside , the decor reminds me of a mid century cafeteria but more modern . <sssss> they have a huge hand painted mural of a farm and a large outdoor seating area for parents to let their kids run around in while they eat . <sssss> joe 's gets packed . <sssss> i 've seen the line wrap around to the outside on the weekends . <sssss> i do n't think it 's worth waiting the 20-30 minutes in line for , but then again i do n't think a lot of places are worth that wait for cafeteria style dining .
?		this little spot can get really packed . <sssss> the first time i was here there was a 20 minute wait . <sssss> the 2nd time the restaurant was full , even though it was pretty late -lrb- about noon -rrb- on sunday . <sssss> the coffee was excellent , strong and dark , and they set the pitcher on your table so you can get really caffeinated up . <sssss> : -rrb- the food and service was great . <sssss> they 've got some interesting breakfast selections on the menu . <sssss> i 'm not into sour cream , cream cheese , or feta on my eggs but for those a little more adventurous for breakfast , i 'm sure would find those selections great . <sssss> i just ordered eggs mixed with vegetables , potatoes , and cheese in a skillet . <sssss> very tasty . <sssss> i guess next time i 'll take the advice of others here and order the french toast ! <sssss> yum .
?		i have to admit , i normally do n't like chinese food . <sssss> in fact , it 's just about the only style of food i have n't fallen in love with at some point in my life . <sssss> this is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for chinese food at all hours of the day/night . <sssss> i figured out why i never liked chinese food when i first ate at asian cafe express . <sssss> it 's because everything i 've had has been americanized chinese food !!! <sssss> it was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when i actually found chinese food i not only liked , i loved ! <sssss> having authentic chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine . <sssss> i have to agree with the others ... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages . <sssss> go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic hong kong style fare . <sssss> holy mother of god , everything i 've tried has been outstanding and each time i leave saying it was the best meal i 've tried thus far . <sssss> everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb . <sssss> the wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food . <sssss> they 'll be quick to recommend something if you 're having a hard time deciding . <sssss> just ask !
?		as much as i like gameworks , you ca n't drink and drive at gameworks ! <sssss> i like the fact you can drink , drink , drink to your hearts content and then play video games with other stupidly drunk adults at dave and buster 's ! <sssss> i 've been to many d & b 's in ca and they were all much larger , had a wider selection of games , and were decorated to a tee . <sssss> this place does n't quite live up , however there 's always a place in my heart for dave and buster 's , no matter how small and cheezy because i can drink alcohol while slamming tokens into a game to win lots of tickets . <sssss> whee ! <sssss> they 've got a pretty decent happy hour too . <sssss> the food is blech , would n't eat it again and it 's expensive too . <sssss> everything else makes me happy . <sssss> i was soooooooooo happy to see a dave and buster 's finally make it to arizona !
?		this place has been recommended to me by family and friends so many times . <sssss> as an arizona native , i 'm ashamed that i had n't been here sooner . <sssss> it took a friend coming into town to get me to go and i 'm so glad i did . <sssss> the fact that they have family circus cartoons everywhere really made me smile . <sssss> i was n't aware that bil keane had so many cartoons centered around the sugar bowl . <sssss> i absolutely love that old time pink and white decor too . <sssss> it 's as if time has stood still and with so much being renovated in the area , it 's great to be reminded of a time in arizona that 's long gone . <sssss> i got a rootbear float which was fantastic . <sssss> the ice cream was plenty and the way it melted in the float made it super thick and luscious . <sssss> they have an old school ski-ball machine that 's bright pink and reminicent of sometime between 1980-1989 . <sssss> : -rrb- i found out their orange sherbet has dairy in it but the raspberry sorbet does not , just in case there 's anyone out there with the sad misfortune of not being able to eat dairy at an ice cream parlor .
?		i decided to give green a few other tries . <sssss> i 've been back for the soynami 's multiple times even . <sssss> they are very good , almost unbelievable how they make them taste . <sssss> they do n't have that nasty nutty soy aftertaste that seriously makes me want to hurl . <sssss> i also tried the original spicy po boy . <sssss> it 's basically just a spicy mock chicken sandwich . <sssss> i 'm not a huge fan of the mock meats but i found it to be ok . <sssss> i would n't order it again but it was n't bad . <sssss> their fries are very delicious and soaked in a layer of grease , which is probably why they taste sooo good . <sssss> the staff is always nice and helpful . <sssss> when i 've asked them about gluten in some of their desserts , they 're very knowledgeable and immediately know what does and does n't , which is a nice surprise .
?		i really love bookmans . <sssss> their huge selection of used books is the best in the valley . <sssss> in many instances they have a much broader selection of harder-to-find books , in store , than all the retail chains , and i 've found that even when the retail chains have what i 'm looking for , they always have to order it because they do n't have it stocked . <sssss> specifically i bought a book recently on alternative healing from amazon . <sssss> i paid $ 4 over the cover price -lrb- unknowingly -rrb- because i wanted it so badly and could n't find it new in any store . <sssss> i did n't even think to go to bookmans , but when i was there this past weekend , i saw two copies of that book in very good condition for less than half the cover price . <sssss> it should n't have surprised me but it did . <sssss> the store always surprises me . <sssss> they 've got such a wide array of stuff , from electronics to used magazines to dvds . <sssss> it 's a bargain shopper/reader/collector 's paradise ~ !
?		alright boys , get past the fact that it 's a little chick centric , arcadia farms is a great place to grab a light bite , but leave feeling satisfied and content . <sssss> my group of 3 split the hummus appetizer , and wholly garbanzo bean batman , it was the best hummus i 've ever had . <sssss> it 's creamy in texture , strong on garlic and citrus flavor , and served with crispy pita chips that are perfectly seasoned . <sssss> next up , the warm chopped vegetable salad with grilled chicken . <sssss> -lrb- let me pause here : i feel it 's my duty to let the yelp community know that i 'm not really a leafy salad guy . <sssss> i 'm pretty serious when it comes to dining out and do n't usually go for the greens . <sssss> in this instance though , the salad was the first menu item that jumped out at me , and so i felt it was a must . <sssss> considering i was there with two people that ordered the same thing , two people that have been to arcadia farms , i felt like it was a pretty solid decision . <sssss> -rrb- the atmosphere is eclectic end energetic . <sssss> the restaurant itself is sectioned off into little rooms , and a few times throughout our lunch , i found myself checking out the architecture and the history behind the pretty old building . <sssss> i suggest calling ahead and making a reservation , or taking your lunch grub back to the office . <sssss> when i was there on a monday , the place was packed ! <sssss> and it 's no surprise why ; great food , good ambiance , and attentive service . <sssss> prices seemed a little steep for lunch , but you 're paying for an experience , so take someone you 're trying to impress and take your time to enjoy .
?		review update weewww weeewww weeewww -lrb- that 's my review update siren . <sssss> so happy to have stayed at the ho this week . <sssss> when gabi m told me that firesky was filled and she was putting me at vho , i did n't complain -lrb- secretly it 's my fave place when i 'm up in scottsdale -rrb- . <sssss> and my fave place just got better , and just got another star because jesse rocked my socks off with his awesome response to my review of the spa products . <sssss> this time around i knew to ask for something a little less redflower , a little less icelandic . <sssss> i 'm sure a lot of people dig it , not this people , er uh me . <sssss> anyway , i loved my room , i loved the option to swap soap , i loved that even though the place was at capacity noise was at a minimum , i loved that even when it cooled down to 60 at night people were still at the pool , it was a big ole love fest . <sssss> ca n't wait for my next trip , hopefully everywhere else will be sold out or gabi will realize that it 's my first choice ; -rrb- . <sssss> -lrb- in other news i think i have andrea r convinced that we need to work poolside next-time ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		mmmmmmm buuuuuuuuurger . <sssss> nothing like leaving the office for lunch outside in march ! <sssss> i think andrea and i def brought down the average age a few years , the place has a very `` ladies who lunch -lrb- and do n't do much else -rrb- '' sort of feel . <sssss> our waiter was quick and speedy and my burger tasted just as great as the last time . <sssss> i promise , i 'll be back to try something new soon ! <sssss> -lrb- i 'm realizing now that the burger is the only thing i 've had there -rrb- . <sssss> know before you go : outside is where it 's at . <sssss> if you can stand a little heat , snag some shade , sit back , and enjoy .
?		this is my favorite place in the scottsdale area hands down . <sssss> amazing food , nice crowd and always consistant . <sssss> and it is never to loud - i recall going to mastro 's thinking it would be a `` nice '' place and felt like i surrounded by a bunch of over grown frat boys with too much money to blow - money does n't mean class ! <sssss> being from los angeles and being spoiled by some great spots - this place is so wonderful and always have such a nice vibe . <sssss> i do however wish they would make their portions larger !
?		loved this place . <sssss> super cool and beautiful bartender/waitress - nikki . <sssss> went for happy hour with my love . <sssss> apps on menu were delicious . <sssss> service great . <sssss> also , loved the music playing in back ground . <sssss> thought the flat screen tv -lrb- in main dining area -rrb- which allows you to watch the bar scene was genius ! <sssss> i could sit there all night & just people watch - who needs reality tv ! <sssss> there is reality furio . <sssss> great spot .
?		i really ca n't get enough of this place . <sssss> for anyone who understands true italian food , this is a must try . <sssss> i always enjoy their fish . <sssss> perfectly prepared and always served up with delicious vegetables . <sssss> in my opinion , this place is a bargain given the entrees are all in the $ 20-30 range . <sssss> pasta is even less than that . <sssss> they also have a decent italian wine offering with most glasses in the $ 8-10 range and bottles below $ 40 . <sssss> i 've always found the food fresh , the service pleasant and the atmosphere lively . <sssss> what more can you ask for ? <sssss> oh , larger portions ? <sssss> go to golden corral if you want to stuff your face .
?		cool bar and ambiance , led tv 's behind 2-way mirrors line the entire bar and somehow perfectly fit -lrb- within 5/8 '' i was told -rrb- . <sssss> i have to say i was not hungry , but tried the blt burger . <sssss> the burger was prepared perfectly to a medium temperature and had a nice crust of salt and pepper on it . <sssss> the smoked bacon was a bit overpowering but good . <sssss> my biggest complaint is the complete lack of condiments . <sssss> no ketchup , mustard or mayo . <sssss> we had to request it and for a table of 6 , two small ketchup cups were brought out , so we had to request them 6 times to get enough to go around . <sssss> duck fat fries were okay . <sssss> i was also disappointed to not see other meats for burgers . <sssss> where 's the bison , ostrich , or my ever favorite lamb burger ? <sssss> -lrb- i am still the self proclaimed king of lamb burgers -rrb- . <sssss> also , i am of the camp where you season both the inside and outside of the burger ... i typically blend meats for my burgers , and add herbs , spices , etc to enhance the flavor . <sssss> you just get meat here -lrb- which some people prefer -rrb- . <sssss> my bottom line is this will be a nice neighborhood hangout , with a great bar and well above average food for a bar , but it 's not worth a drive .
?		i felt like agent cooper in twin peaks as i sat down to sample several slices of pie in one sitting . <sssss> i 'm twitching as i write this ... drooling over the memory of each slice and how amazingly good it tasted . <sssss> the blueberry crumb , the peach , the jack daniel 's pecan . <sssss> i left with a whole apple crumb , which later on became 1/3 of an apple crumb pie before nights end . <sssss> as their website states , worth the drive from anywhere ... it is .
?		amc esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new `` dinner and a movie '' blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate -lrb- that 's right , i just referenced blue ocean strategy , get over it -rrb- . <sssss> no , it 's not an extremely enlightened idea . <sssss> i 've been sneaking bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it 's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it , but amc really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from them , but also upgraded chairs , and a ton of delicious food -lrb- including the obligatory $ 4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $ 9 burger . <sssss> like `` do n't mind this $ 9 full meal over here , we still stand firm that gummi bears are worth their weight in gold . '' <sssss> -rrb- yes , it 's more expensive than a regular ticket . <sssss> almost double for the nice seats . <sssss> but trust me , you want those seats . <sssss> you will regret not getting the $ 15 seats if you do n't buy the $ 15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home . <sssss> this theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable . <sssss> i saw the master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled bacardi flask if i did n't have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it . <sssss> i seriously wo n't go to a movie anywhere else and i guarantee you 'll say the same once you go . <sssss> five stars .
?		we wandered in here after walking back to the zipp 's parking lot for vehicle retrieval . <sssss> i got a delicious peach iced tea that i did n't want to end . <sssss> however , i just walked half a mile in 100 degree weather , so it had to . <sssss> they have adorable little treats for only $ .60 each -lrb- or 3 for $ 1.50 -rrb- . <sssss> the chocolate covered macaroon was by far the best . <sssss> much like the elusive `` bon bon '' i feel like i 've heard a lot about macaroons in my life , while never actually tasting one , so i 'm glad that changed with mama java . <sssss> also , they have a toy sushi set that i really enjoyed . <sssss> it was among the books . <sssss> next to the mr. potato head . <sssss> i think it was for children , but i 'm easily amused so i had a fun time with it . <sssss> the only thing i would change is the $ .50 surcharge for credit card transactions . <sssss> but their macaroons are only $ .60 . <sssss> i could probably scrounge up that kinda coin from my car any given day , so i 'm not too worried about it .
?		you guys have no idea how long i debated whether or not to leave a review for little woody . <sssss> it was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as i possibly could , mostly because the place is n't that big , i live across the street , and i appreciate at least a foot of personal space . <sssss> welp , that foot of personal space is almost gone now so i figure it 's about the time to profess my love for this not-really-a-dive bar , especially since they just added the most amazing back room a bar has ever had . <sssss> seriously , i could set up a cot , eat , drink , and sleep in that back room and have absolutely no problems in life . <sssss> they have shuffleboard , darts , and skeeball ! <sssss> really , what more can you ask for ? <sssss> in my original review of the great escape -lrb- r.i.p. , gone but not forgotten -rrb- , i concluded with `` if they had shuffleboard , i 'd bump them up to 5 stars '' ... little woody did me one better and got shuffle board while simultaneously getting rid of that weird old person basement smell the place used to have -lrb- and replacing it with the lovely smell of wood -rrb- . <sssss> what really makes this bar though is that everyone is seriously so freaking friendly . <sssss> once a guy asked me to punch him in the stomach ... super friendly because i love punching people . <sssss> another time we sat down at a random table and played a game of rcl with a group of complete strangers , obviously awesome . <sssss> one stranger let me play with his iphone 5 the day it came out just because i noticed it . <sssss> i 've only been mean-mugged like once and those girls clearly got lost looking for mint , so that 's not the wood 's fault . <sssss> all in all , i love this bar , i can now loudly declare that i love this bar , and if you want to come and be cool and love this bar with me you can . <sssss> just leave the mean-mugging in old town .
?		i 'm sorry upper deck , i just have to . <sssss> you just were n't good . <sssss> at all . <sssss> you had the ufc fight on and did n't charge a cover , that was nice . <sssss> but i was n't really there to watch half-naked sweaty dudes embrace each other for the better part of 15 minutes , i was there to eat and drink and make inappropriate comments while the people i was with watched the fights . <sssss> and i probably wo n't be back , because the eats sucked and while the drinks did what they were supposed to do , they did n't make up for the below average food and barely average service . <sssss> i 'm adding an extra star for the delightful mural they had in the women 's bathroom , my favorite part of which is now uploaded under `` photos '' . <sssss> you 're welcome .
?		the last time i was here i went with two female co-workers who were mildly obsessed with the idea of me dating our waiter . <sssss> i 'm no stranger to objectifying cute male wait staff -lrb- cough * roka akor * cough -rrb- , but even i felt uncomfortable for him after he had to endure approximately 3 hours of merciless cougar flirting followed by loud encouragement for me to take a more active approach to my dating life by hitting on him . <sssss> i felt like i was having dinner with my two pimps , but he was a total pro about it and it ended up being an incredible meal ! <sssss> i had been to sens once before where i had the most amazing pimm 's cup ever . <sssss> i freaking love pimm 's cups , and only a handful of places in phoenix serve them , so when i get a good one , i remember it vividly -lrb- well , as vividly as i can remember things that occur on patios at 1:00 am on a saturday -rrb- . <sssss> after going for dinner a few weeks ago , i had the same thing and it was just as good , even though i was n't nearly as drunk as i was the first time . <sssss> since my bac fluctuates like kirstie alley 's waistline , that 's about all the consistency i can ask for . <sssss> we ordered a ton of food , which seems to mostly be served small-plate style with 4 or 5 servings per order . <sssss> this is perfect for me , because i tend to get bored easily and after a few bites of the same thing , i 'm ready for something else -lrb- this might explain why my co-workers feel the need to take control of my dating life -rrb- . <sssss> everything we ordered was fantastic ! <sssss> we started off with sizzling shrimp in a spicy red sauce . <sssss> the shrimp was perfect and sauce was actually spicy . <sssss> nothing pisses me off more than when restaurants cater to the wimpy masses by having their `` spice-o-meter '' equivalent to that of a kindergartner with an ulcer . <sssss> the soup gyoza , bacon wrapped dates , sugar cane pork , and bacon wrapped okra were all just as good . <sssss> for dessert we had bacon-wrapped lychees -lrb- bacon was clearly the theme of the evening -rrb- and it was pretty much the perfect conclusion to the fantastic meal . <sssss> even though i 've only been to sens twice , it 's slowly creeping up my list of favorite restaurants in phoenix and will probably only continue to climb as i visit more often . <sssss> maybe next time i wo n't bring my pimps -lrb- but no promises -rrb- .
?		honestly , i 'm only writing this review because i just made a list titled `` places i get crizzunk '' and merc bar absolutely has to be on it . <sssss> because , well , i do . <sssss> i 'm not sure what it is about the place ... i think because they do n't really serve food here so just by showing up you 're basically letting everyone know that you 're there to party . <sssss> or maybe because the music is a little too loud to have a conversation , but it 's not really a dancing place either . <sssss> or because it 's all inside so you ca n't smoke and drink . <sssss> whatever the reason , merc nights usually result in an extremely bad hangover for me the next morning . <sssss> but i never learn my lesson and tend to end up there at least once a month . <sssss> last time , someone who was equally crizzunk started a conga line when `` jump in the line '' came on ... i jumped on -lrb- of course -rrb- ... i mean , c'mon , who would n't want to do a conga line to that song ? <sssss> but apparently the merc crowd is too cool for school and were n't having it . <sssss> i know it 's supposed to be swanky and classy , but really it 's just a close place to my house that i drink at . <sssss> sorry in advance if i ruin your ambiance , but i always have an extremely good time here .
?		the best cupcake i ever had . <sssss> which means , based on my experience with cupcakes , sprinkles red velvet is officially better than : - cupcakes purchased at several bake sales between 3rd and 5th grade - cupcakes my boss sometimes brings in from his wife - st patrick 's day cupcakes i once bought at fry 's on march 18th because they were 50 % off . <sssss> so maybe i 'm not the cupcake connoisseur i 'd like to be , but that was a damn good cupcake . <sssss> a little heavy on the icing , but the cake was perfectly moist and delicious . <sssss> at $ 3.50 a pop , i suppose the prices could be lower , but the cupcake did n't disappoint so i ca n't be too angry about the $ 1 - $ 2 upcharge from the church bake sale down the street . <sssss> or fry 's on march 18th .
?		this place is just okay - nothing amazing . <sssss> we have liked our food here , but it was nothing out of this world .
?		we had a burger and the asian shrimp dish , and both were not good . <sssss> some of the prices were reasonable , but some were definitely overpriced . <sssss> the drinks are super expensive too ! <sssss> other friends at our table also thought that the food was not very good . <sssss> the ambiance is very scottsdale-ish , so you do need to be in that sort of mood to be here . <sssss> our server was friendly .
?		very friendly service and nice atmosphere . <sssss> they also allowed me to order the kid 's bean & cheese burrito , which was only $ 4 and very large ! <sssss> it was also very good . <sssss> hopefully i will be able to return in the future to try more of the menu .
?		enjoyed this food at the sunnyslope art walk . <sssss> very delicious ! <sssss> it was fun to try food that we have never tried before . <sssss> loved the pupusas !! <sssss> our favorite was the pork -lrb- with cheese and beans i believe -rrb- . <sssss> we usually are not pork people , but the flavor was great !
?		eh , this place is not too good . <sssss> i definitely would n't choose to return here . <sssss> the food is just ok , which makes it way overpriced for what it is . <sssss> nothing on the menu is special or unique . <sssss> we also felt like our stomachs were carrying huge bricks after we ate here . <sssss> our server was also rude and not very attentive . <sssss> his mind seemed to be somewhere else the entire time , and it seemed like he did n't want to be there at all .
?		i would give this place more stars if the prices were lower or the food was better . <sssss> unfortunately , expensive prices for mediocre food is not for me . <sssss> we tried 5 dishes here , and neither of us were excited about any of them . <sssss> the calamari was bland and rubbery , the patatas -lrb- although cooked very well -rrb- were doused in too much sauce , and the cheese croquettes were just okay . <sssss> the filet was the best thing we ordered , and it was pretty good . <sssss> the creme brulee dessert was not very good . <sssss> our server was very friendly , but the server for nearby tables was quite loud and annoying . <sssss> all in all , i would have been pretty happy if our food cost half as much as it did .
?		the food here was very good and fresh ! <sssss> we were able to try multiple things off of the menu - guacamole , soup , white bean side , salads , and tacos . <sssss> we just loved the decor of this place ! <sssss> all the leather was beautiful . <sssss> we knocked it down a star because : the server could have been better . <sssss> while he was n't awful , we think he was a bit snooty because we did n't order alcohol . <sssss> also , the tacos order was tiny ! <sssss> it was almost a joke ! <sssss> but , everything was very good .
?		very good food and service ! <sssss> we got a delicious brussel sprout salad with salmon as well as the french dip . <sssss> it was not our absolute favorite french dip , but it was definitely one of the better ones we have had . <sssss> their butterscotch/caramel dessert was absolutely amazing ! <sssss> great service too . <sssss> the decor was comfy and laid back .
?		this place is just okay . <sssss> the food was decent , but it is overpriced for what you get . <sssss> also , our server was not very attentive at all . <sssss> it was a busy night , but he hardly came to our table , and when he was there , it was obvious that he did not want to be there .
?		very good thai food and reasonably priced as well . <sssss> the service is friendly , and the atmosphere is very laid back and casual . <sssss> make sure to go in for happy hour . <sssss> they have some great specials !
?		we really like this place and come here often ! <sssss> all the food is healthy and delicious . <sssss> we have had some amazing side dishes , soups , wraps , lavash pizzas , lemonade , etc ! <sssss> we can not wait to take our out-of-town family when they visit . <sssss> yum !
?		my absolutely favorite ever cupcake is here - orange blossom . <sssss> sooo good ! <sssss> pretty much everything else here is delicious as well . <sssss> : - -rrb-
?		make sure to sit at the chef 's table . <sssss> it 's quite an experience ! <sssss> here you sit at the bar facing the kitchen and the chef himself , razz ! <sssss> they bring you small plates -lrb- priced at $ 10 a plate -rrb- until you tell them to stop . <sssss> both times we went , we stopped after 4 courses and then had the dessert -lrb- which was $ 20 for the shared plate and consisted of 3 `` slices '' of different desserts -rrb- . <sssss> i 'd say the best part of the meals are the sauces - absolutely amazing ! <sssss> we made sure to have bread on hand to soak it all up . <sssss> each course is different from the next , and all of it is scrumptious ! <sssss> if you want a quicker meal , i 'd say to get an earlier seating -lrb- 6pm -rrb- , as we were out in an hour . <sssss> last time , i believe we had an 8pm seating , and it was more crowded by then . <sssss> enjoy !
?		i consider myself a sort of hot pot connoisseur - i grew up having hot pot at home a few times a year and i 've tried hot pot places around asia and la , where i 'm from . <sssss> as the only hot pot place around -lrb- that we could find , at least -rrb- , tien wong is really good . <sssss> the meat and vegetables were really fresh and clean , which is probably the most important thing about hot pot . <sssss> we opted with the japanese miso soup base because we do n't really like the herby stuff they put in the house soup base . <sssss> if you go , remember to request for the sacha or satay sauce . <sssss> sacha sauce is a staple of hot pot in hong kong and taiwan . <sssss> the sauce tien wong gives you is like a sweet soy sauce with cilantro and green onions plus a peanut sauce , but their sacha is really good - better than the ones i 've bought at the supermarket . <sssss> makes hot pot that much more enjoyable ! <sssss> my favorite part after eating hot pot is drinking the flavorful soup afterwards . <sssss> it 's piping hot and has all the flavors of all the meat juice and veggies in it . <sssss> i can drink the whole pot , really . <sssss> after our meal , they gave us this cool sugar cane -lrb- i think -rrb- drink . <sssss> it was kind of bland , but it really cools off your stomach and balances out your qi . <sssss> service was fast and helpful , probably because they 're a little over-staffed . <sssss> the ambiance is rather fancy , i think , for a hot pot place , but it 's really nicely decorated . <sssss> the place is dim , so it 's a little bit romantic , but each table is well-lit , so you can see if your food is properly cooked . <sssss> the only gripe i have about this place is that it is way too overpriced . <sssss> hot pot should be pretty inexpensive , and the places i usually go to give you good portions for pretty cheap prices . <sssss> at tien wong , the portions are pretty dainty and they charge a lot for them . <sssss> it 's fine , though , because they sort of have a hot pot monopoly . <sssss> but that 's the only thing that 's keeping me from going back . <sssss> : -lrb- oh , and they do n't open until 3:00 every day so do n't try to go for lunch !
?		i had tried five guys on one of the very first days i got to tempe because my boyfriend had heard people rave about it so much . <sssss> i did n't write a review of it then because i honestly forgot how what i thought about it . <sssss> but now that i 've tried it again , i remember how not memorable it was . <sssss> admittedly , the burgers are really good . <sssss> they come with a huuge variety of dressing , sauces , vegetables , and other granishes , so you can have your burger any way you like it . <sssss> the normal size burgers have 2 burger patties , so if you 're like me and are just used to the real normal one-patty burger , opt for the `` little '' hamburger , even though it 's really not little at all . <sssss> the hamburger did taste really good and there 's malt vinegar that adds to the glorious messiness of eating a burger , but really , i do n't think it 's any better than any other burger place - including in-n-out . <sssss> they have unlimited peanuts , but i 'm meh about peanuts . <sssss> um ... their fries are good , but again , not too special . <sssss> i would go back , but i do n't think i 'd ever crave going back .
?		the location deserves 5 stars alone ! <sssss> next door to amazing pizza , an epic wine bar , a hell ` ofa good time pub and nooooooboooooooo -lrb- thats how i say it , i like to sing or over pronounce everything i do except while in the shower . <sssss> i have dislexia -rrb- . <sssss> the building is cool ; you will find this to be my bunker once the zombies invade . <sssss> its all concrete . <sssss> i have my pirate bandana ready . <sssss> the exhibtis are cool ... for kids . <sssss> if your an adult , you may want to only go for certain things . <sssss> pirate exhibt ? <sssss> body art ? <sssss> maybe a model railroad convention or a `` build a science project style volcano and come blow it up here '' event . <sssss> but if you love science , and howthingswork.com , you 'll never leave -lrb- and at $ 23 per adult for admission and $ 18 for a kid , you may be like me and demand a sleep over ; the seattle science center does this for kid field trips , it was legend ... airy -rrb- . <sssss> lots of cool things to check out like a bike on a rope , and you pedal over the 1st floor from the 2nd floor and the people below you walk under you -lrb- yup , you guessed it , i had to look up and mess with a person on a bike -rrb- . <sssss> electircity , cameras , hd and different rock things from all over arizona . <sssss> the coolest part though , was it is really all about az which , not being a native , i know nohting abour az other than the local bar 's -lrb- um , big up 's to all the yelpers out there ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> all in all , if you go for a specifc thing -lrb- like i did for hte pirate exhibt which is a 5 star event -rrb- , my tip would be to make an afternoon of it . <sssss> hit rose and crown for an app and a drink . <sssss> then sc for a bit . <sssss> then bianco for pizza and wine . <sssss> then get the hell out of my down town you freaking tourist driving the wrong way on a 1 way street -lrb- the other tip ; read the street signs or pay the price -rrb- . <sssss> dueces .
?		how many great things can one say about the cartel ? <sssss> does infinity work ! <sssss> yes , that was a statement , not a question . <sssss> i am in love with the cc , hands down . <sssss> i have traded my gold starbucks card in for this amazingly delicious start to my day . <sssss> the iced coffee -lrb- actually , its toddy , which is better -rrb- is amazing . <sssss> they roast their own beans , and allow the iced coffee to sit over night , creating an extremely potent concoction . <sssss> the hot drinks , a + + + as well . <sssss> and , the food ? <sssss> a + + + + + -lrb- 5 , yup its that legit -rrb- . <sssss> grab the cheddar bacon muffin ... its literally heaven . <sssss> no joke . <sssss> heaven . <sssss> little clouds may form above your head ; white clouds of course ! <sssss> not those nasty rain clouds . <sssss> ok , maybe not clouds . <sssss> but defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into coffee cartel . <sssss> and not because you live in az . <sssss> . <sssss> duh . <sssss> only complaint i have is the hours . <sssss> i live right next door , and their only open m-f -lrb- like so many places in dt-pho -rrb- . <sssss> pllleeeeaaaassseeeeee open up for the weekends !!! <sssss> i 'll work for free ! <sssss> well ... wait ... i 'll come visit .
?		first off , i 'll admit that this is the only place i 'll take my ride too in down town phx . <sssss> of course , to be unbiased , that 's because its the only place to take your ride too in dt phx . <sssss> so , let 's be real . <sssss> 2nd ` ly , i drive a tahoe on big rim 's . <sssss> it 's not the easiest thing to clean , and i refuse to do it myself -lrb- my own laziness gets a 1 star for car washing , i 'm awesome but not that awesome -rrb- . <sssss> also , it 's black . <sssss> so double dipper here . <sssss> the service is fast and friendly , which i love . <sssss> danny 's needs to take a group field trip here to learn customer service ! <sssss> lo 's defiantly has the upper hand in the area . <sssss> and for the price -lrb- i pay about $ 20 for the works wash every time -rrb- it cant be beat and i cant be too sour on it . <sssss> it 's really just minor things ; sometimes they forget to wipe out the deep dish rim 's thoroughly , or there are minor water spots , or little stains left on the wood grain . <sssss> nothing really major , but i just expect perfection every time -lrb- which i 'm well aware that would only happen if i washed myself , and most likely it would n't happen because my add would kick in half way through and i would be driving a half dirty half clean whip around town -rrb- . <sssss> also , they have a punch card as well which is very nice ! <sssss> buy 10 , get numero 11 free . <sssss> all in all , defiantly 1.5 thumbs up from me ; hoping for a full 2 soon .
?		i am giving olive & ivy only 1 star because the employees have no idea how to run a restaurant or deal with customers . <sssss> we went there to celebrate a birthday which did not go too well . <sssss> first when we made the reservation we were told to come in before 3pm on a sunday so we could order from 3 menus well when we arrived , we were told a different story about the menus and told something else by another person and the story kept changing depending on who you spoke with . <sssss> well this restaurant should be closed between 3-5pm on weekends as the only items are flatbreads , a select few salads and apps but no one tells you this when you call . <sssss> so we had planned to order dinner but were told we could not something to do with the kitchen , but we were also told we could not order from the brunch or lunch menu either so we were stuck as to what to order , well it was terrible - the flat breads were terrible , dry and way to salty . <sssss> the bacon burger was not worth $ 12.00 and it was just a real bad time and the manager would not comp anything for all the bad information and did not seem to care we could not find anything good to eat on the menu . <sssss> we had told the waitress we could not handle anything spicy as to let us know if we ordered something which was spicy well do not order the hummus , we were not told it had jalapenos in it even though we asked , they did not take it off the bill even though 5 of the 6 people at the table did not eat it . <sssss> we will not visit again , very bad experience , bad manager , bad customer service . <sssss> not a good fox restaurant , plus the uniforms looked like construction workers . <sssss> the food , was well not worth the money and have had much better elsewhere .
?		went out with some friends , please be advise if you plan on sitting outside make sure you have a flashlight as there are no lights outside and it is had to see or even read the menu . <sssss> the outside sitting was packed , felt like a sardine . <sssss> too many tables way too close to others . <sssss> the food was just okay , nothing great - my chicken was way dry along with the pitas which had no taste . <sssss> the cucumber saw was good along with the salad . <sssss> had to wait a while for our waitress , not good to go if the place is busy , service not good . <sssss> just okay .
?		i agree with yuck . <sssss> this is a boring loud terrible place to eat . <sssss> the food is below average and a waste of money . <sssss> much better places to eat then here . <sssss> my dad had the meatball sub which was huge but nothing special about it just ordinary . <sssss> i ordered the gluten free pizza - but it was not good - the sauce tasted like hunt 's tomatoe paste - maybe if they had a home cooked sauce it would have been better . <sssss> plus there gluten free pizza is not really gluten free because they make it in the same ovens as their wheat pizza . <sssss> and it was terrible , we sent items back and threw stuff away . <sssss> if you are looking for good ny pizza try nypd much better than this place by far .
?		what great place to come for a quick breakfast ! <sssss> i must admit when we pulled up i saw few people waiting outside and thought and told my husband that i did n't want to go in cause there looks like a line . <sssss> but he convinced me that we should just go in . <sssss> we walked in and the hostess told us it would be 5-10 minutes i surprised how fast they seated us . <sssss> there was soo much to choose from on the menu , but i am such a simple girl i just wanted to egg , bacon , and potatoes , and that 's what i got ! <sssss> and the decaf was n't too bad either ! <sssss> the real reason why i chose to eat here was because i read gabi m 's review who is the community manager of scottsdale/phx area . <sssss> the funniest thing is that just as we got our coffee a guy walked by and i noticed that it was gabi 's husband , then who should be walking behind him gabi !!! <sssss> loved that ! <sssss> always great to see you gabi !!! <sssss> thanks for your review ! <sssss> great place !
?		i love this place !!!!! <sssss> we had gone for our wedding anniversary , and i had booked the room through one of those travel websites , and if you do that regularly you now that your room is going to be just a room nothing special . <sssss> so as we are checking in to the hotel , the front desk clerk informs us that our room is n't ready , and that we had been upgraded to casita . <sssss> i knew from our last stay here those rooms are n't cheap , but when he said that i was jumping for joy inside ! <sssss> the room was sooooo wonderful we did n't want to leave the next day !
?		my favorite cupcakes ever ! <sssss> well just the red velvet ! <sssss> i love when they put the saguaro 's on them i love that , it makes me feel like we they made is especially for me ! <sssss> everyone should go and grab a cupcake when they are in the area ! <sssss> now all they need is the atm cupcake machine like that they have in la . <sssss> .
?		i went here on my birthday with my husband and mother . <sssss> i found the booth we sat in to be uncomfortable and needing to be replaced . <sssss> i ordered a dirty martini and it was very good ! <sssss> good price also . <sssss> we got the fried raviolis for an appetizer and i think that was my favorite part of the meal . <sssss> i ordered a veggie burger -lrb- since i am a vegetarian -rrb- and it was just so - so . <sssss> it was served on bread instead of a bun which bugged me . <sssss> they did bring out a complimentary ooey gooey cake for dessert but i did n't try any . <sssss> i wo n't go out of my way to return again .
?		i have not had better chinese food since moving to arizona . <sssss> the restaurant was 3/4 full on a tuesday night !!! <sssss> with many asian people . <sssss> i thought in this `` recession '' that having a restaurant that packed was a pretty amazing thing . <sssss> the service was superb . <sssss> the food was overall yummy . <sssss> i did not enjoy the greasy wonton chips that are served for free before the meal . <sssss> my friend really like them though ?!?! <sssss> the hot tea was good . <sssss> my veggie dish -lrb- something with bamboo shoots , mushrooms , green pepper , broccoli , ect . <sssss> -rrb- and steamed rice was good . <sssss> i ate every single bite . <sssss> the free dessert -lrb- wontons filled with banana and others with plum maybe ? <sssss> -rrb- were yummy . <sssss> the total bill with tax and tip for 2 entrees and 1 soda was $ 24 . <sssss> i left full and happy .
?		if you are in the area i much prefer thai elephant which is near by . <sssss> we did a taste test on the soup - tom yum and tom kha . <sssss> one night we ordered a bowl of each at thai elephant and the very next night we made the same order at lemongrass thai . <sssss> t.e won hands down . <sssss> also , ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it .
?		clean restaurant . <sssss> fast service . <sssss> good breakfast . <sssss> i only had the oatmeal but it was good and cheap . <sssss> the iced tea was fresh . <sssss> my friend had bacon -lrb- looked thick and perfectly cooked -rrb- , eggs and hashbrowns . <sssss> i recommend !
?		i went for breakfast with a couple friends on a tuesday morning at about 9:30 am . <sssss> the restaurant was busy but we were seated right away . <sssss> the service was superb and the food yummy . <sssss> a friend and i shared some dish with chiles and potatoes and eggs and avocado on top . <sssss> i am so glad we shared ... plenty of food for two . <sssss> i love that bagels come with the breakfast . <sssss> i am a fan of bagels !! <sssss> mmmmm ... everything in the bakery is so pretty and delicious looking but i was to full to think about taking something to go . <sssss> maybe next time .
?		i do n't get it . <sssss> i thought for the amount of food we got and the quality that it was overpriced . <sssss> tried the veggie burger . <sssss> the flavor was fine but it was very thin and crumbly and made a terrible mess . <sssss> did not like the smash fries at all . <sssss> our family of 5 did n't even finish the one order . <sssss> the line was very long on a sunday afternoon and the service was not great . <sssss> we wo n't be going back .
?		decent lunch . <sssss> had the vegetarian platter . <sssss> my favorite was the baba ganoush . <sssss> easy to find coupons for ... including the entertainment book . <sssss> the greek fries sound tasty .
?		great , friendly service . <sssss> loved the potato latkes for breakfast . <sssss> and the bagel ! <sssss> mmmm ... i 'm a carb girl .
?		i thought the best part was the ambiance outside by the waterfall . <sssss> the second best part was the pomegranate margarita . <sssss> the third best part was my portobello mushroom burger with chipotle mayonnaise .
?		is it just me or does costco have the best hot dogs ?!?! <sssss> yum !!!
?		great service . <sssss> nice ambiance . <sssss> so glad they have kids meals now . <sssss> last time i was there -lrb- long time ago -rrb- they did n't . <sssss> so your child can eat for between $ 2.95 and $ 4.95 , including a drink . <sssss> the happy hour is decent . <sssss> i had a coconut lemon drop -lrb- yum -rrb- for $ 6 , hubby had a large sake for $ 4 . <sssss> plus i shared the edamamme and tofu potstickers with my girls . <sssss> there are three small ones for $ 3.25 but they are good . <sssss> one child had the lo mein with tofu , one had buhdda 's feast with tofu . <sssss> the buhdda 's feast was just steamed carrot , broccoli and sugar snap peas . <sssss> the rice and sauce -lrb- she got sweet & sour -rrb- was on the side . <sssss> my birthday boy ordered off the gluten free menu and had the mongolian beef . <sssss> he scarfed it down . <sssss> hubby had gluten free spicy chicken . <sssss> it was n't hot enough for him so he added more pepper sauce but he did enjoy it . <sssss> i had the vegetarian spicy eggplant . <sssss> it was delicious . <sssss> $ 7.95 and i could n't even finish it . <sssss> for my son 's birthday they brought him a free mini dessert . <sssss> he chose triple chocolate mousse . <sssss> usually they are $ 2.25 each . <sssss> total bill was $ 70 .
?		i have been twice now . <sssss> the thing that assaults me as soon as i walk in the door is the smell of baby poop . <sssss> i have no idea what causes the smell but it is very strong . <sssss> my children noticed and mentioned it to me the moment they walked through the doors also . <sssss> the sat at the table with their noses plugged . <sssss> my kids liked the deep fried tofu for $ 3.50 and it was a good portion size . <sssss> 8 large chunks of tofu . <sssss> i tried the braised noodle with sesame paste -lrb- vegetarian -rrb- for $ 4 . <sssss> it was so plain with very little taste . <sssss> tasted slightly like peanut sauce . <sssss> i had to cover it in srarachi to get it down because i was so hungry . <sssss> kids liked the beef with fried noodles for $ 7.95 . <sssss> with the tofu it was enough food for my 3 kids that i brought home leftovers of both the noodles and tofu . <sssss> i tried the vegetables with fried noodles on my first trip for $ 7.25 . <sssss> they were just okay . <sssss> even though the noodles are being made right there and you can watch through the window the taste was very similar to panda express to me . <sssss> had three of the smoothies - watermelon , papaya and strawberrry - all with boba . <sssss> the boba was pretty good but the smoothies were n't great . <sssss> i prefer boba house around the corner in the same shopping center . <sssss> i do n't think i will be back .
?		my two stars is for the food and ordering process . <sssss> i still thing going to the restaurant to experience the organ and bring friends or visitors is a must . <sssss> they only accept cash or check and that is always inconvenient . <sssss> very few places do n't take debit cards and i contantly have to remind myself to go to the bank on our way to organ stop . <sssss> you wait in line to order your food and it bothers me that i ca n't get mushrooms on only 1/4 of the pizza . <sssss> toppings are only done in 1/2 . <sssss> after you pay for your food you wait in a new line to get your drinks . <sssss> frustrating !!! <sssss> the pizza is not even worth eating , imo . <sssss> the fried appetizers are decent - i like the zucchini and mushrooms but not so much the mozzarella sticks . <sssss> the salad bar is an option . <sssss> the beer and wine is cheap . <sssss> if you want ice cream after your meal that is a third line you wait in .
?		this is the best . <sssss> if you do n't eat diary you ca n't beat how wonderful the fruit flavors are ... how can they be dairy free ? <sssss> yummy !!
?		food was good . <sssss> greasy but good . <sssss> the price of the small glass of fresh sqeezed orange juice was silly expensive but it was tasty . <sssss> i had an omelet with sauteed mushrooms and onions and cheddar cheese with wheat toast and preserves as well as home fries . <sssss> i would eat here again if there was no wait and i was in the area .
?		was nice to be able to sit out on the patio for dinner . <sssss> we arrived in time for happy hour so we tried the sweet potatoe appetizer . <sssss> i loved it and my friend did n't care that much for it . <sssss> she liked the dipping sauce but thought the potatoe had little flavor . <sssss> got the tom kha soup and ca n't wait to have it again . <sssss> it was so so so good . <sssss> also ordered the pad thai noodles with tofu and thought it was disgusting . <sssss> i sent it back and they took it off the bill . <sssss> very eggy . <sssss> the only time i have had pad thai was at home when i made it . <sssss> perhaps i just do n't care for the restaurant variety of it .
?		yum ! <sssss> yum ! <sssss> yum ! <sssss> i went with a friend for dinner on a wednesday night and the restaurant was fairly crowded . <sssss> she got some thanksgiving turkey pasty with stuffing , gravy and cranberry sauce on the side . <sssss> she said it was wonderful . <sssss> as a vegetarian there was a whole page of choices !! <sssss> i went with the mock rosemary chicken one the waitress recommended . <sssss> i really liked it ... mock chicken , brie cheese , mushrooms , potatoes , roasted red peppers and a sweet mustard sauce on the side . <sssss> it was so filling that i could n't even finish it . <sssss> which is a bit of a bummer because i wanted one of the delish sounding desserts so bad . <sssss> i must make a special trip some night soon just for dessert . <sssss> the atmosphere was trendy , fun and friendly . <sssss> the service was great . <sssss> the food was cheap and as good as it gets . <sssss> what took me so long to finally try this place ? <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back .
?		i 'm very picky when it comes to fast food mexican . <sssss> it can be simple but it has to be good . <sssss> this place had very matter of fact service . <sssss> the food was done in a quick time frame but it just was n't that cheap or that good to bother going back to . <sssss> ordered a bean and cheese burrito with potato added to it . <sssss> the tortilla was delicious . <sssss> it smelled and tasted fresh made . <sssss> however it was a bit burned . <sssss> then the beans were very average with thick shreds of cheddar cheese . <sssss> the potatoes were gross in my opinion . <sssss> they were very big chunks of breakfast style potatoes with lots and lots of pepper . <sssss> i am not a fan of pepper . <sssss> also ordered the 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole . <sssss> my children did not care for the `` meat '' in the middle . <sssss> the guacamole was a bit sour tasting . <sssss> i did like that the tacos were thickly rolled . <sssss> the outside was super crisp and the inside mushy . <sssss> that appealed to me ... we wo n't be back .
?		i like this mall . <sssss> i like the wildflower bread co. , see 's cany , auntie anne 's , kb toys , the pet store , build a bear , apple store , nordstroms , kiddie kandids , ect ect . <sssss> i think they have a decent food court and i like that they offer a play area for the kids . <sssss> i enjoy the outside area with the water fountain and restaurants .
?		i ate here for the second time last night . <sssss> the $ 5 off $ 20 coupon in the entertainment book sealed the deal . <sssss> the restaurant has changed the menu a bit and added 3 vegetarian options to the menu . <sssss> the lemon grass rice noodles that i previously mentioned along with a vegetarian curry and vegetarian fish dish . <sssss> the food was really yummy as was the iced jasmine tea .
?		i wanted to hate this place . <sssss> there is n't that much parking . <sssss> it is packed with only a few big picnic tables to sit outside and eat . <sssss> it was to hot to eat outside , imo which meant i had to take my sandwhich to go . <sssss> there were only 4 sandwiches and 3 salads to choose from . <sssss> one dessert they were sold out of . <sssss> the price was high - $ 8 for a sandwich with no sides . <sssss> however , once i took my first bite of the tomatoe , basil , mozzarella sandwich i was in heaven . <sssss> the perfect amount of each ingredient . <sssss> they have perfected the sandwich !! <sssss> i have been craving it ever since . <sssss> i will stop by for lunch everytime i am in the area . <sssss> i will bring everyone i know to eat here ! <sssss> seriously !
?		i was told that this place was no longer cash only and that the service and toddy had gotten better . <sssss> that person was right about 2 of those things . <sssss> the guy and girl who were working on the morning i decided to give this place another shot were better than the other baristas i had encountered before , but they were so chatty with each other and with my friend i waited a good 4 or 5 mins just to tell them what i wanted to drink . <sssss> the service was a little bit better and i 'm not above dishing out pleasantries , but jesus h. christ , can i order my drink please ?!?! <sssss> the girl was soooo talkative and loud , that the mom in me wanted to shuuuuush her . <sssss> i was finally able to order my drink after a good long while of listening to her talk about vintage aprons . <sssss> i got the toddy and guess what ? <sssss> it was still freaking gross . <sssss> yuck . <sssss> yuck . <sssss> yuck . <sssss> still the same old weak watered down `` coffee '' i remember from well over a year ago . <sssss> for the record , i probably would n't have voluntarily came back in here , but a friend wanted to take me out for coffee and this was his choice of venue . <sssss> i was n't impressed enough with the improvement to give them another star . <sssss> but i will applaud their attempt at hiring better baristas and deciding to join the 21st century and getting a credit card reader .
?		athenian express has a huge selection of things to chose from . <sssss> they have salads , burgers , gyros , pasta , subs , and pitas ! <sssss> there are also lots of vegetarian items . <sssss> their hummus is out of this world . <sssss> they make it fresh every morning and it comes with a generous helping of their pita that they get flown in from chicago because it 's some of the best pita in the country . <sssss> i 've had lots of different things on their menu and i liked each and every thing i 've tried . <sssss> sometimes their fries are a little over cooked and under salted but whatever , i do n't go there for the fries . <sssss> the gyros are great , so are their pitas . <sssss> my favorite pita is the chicken picado . <sssss> the chicken is always very juicy and fresh and the grilled vegetables are well cooked and pair well with the chicken . <sssss> i know they 're also doing breakfast now , which i have had once . <sssss> i do n't remember what i got because it was some years ago , but i remember leaving satisfied and full . <sssss> i think for the price and quality , you just ca n't beat athenian express . <sssss> for a year , i worked right next door to them . <sssss> i would stop in almost every day and get lunch and talk with the owner and his wife . <sssss> they are very friendly and funny , as is their staff . <sssss> i always felt welcomed . <sssss> even with phones ringing off the hook and lines out the door , they always have a smile on their faces . <sssss> i stop in maybe once every 3 months or so and the only thing that 's changed since i worked next to them is that they 've renovated and made the place bigger . <sssss> some people might not like that , but they generate way too much business and they really needed the extra seating area . <sssss> i love athenian express , and their employees . <sssss> it 's a hidden gem that i 'm glad i found .
?		finally !!!! <sssss> the strawberry salsa is back ! <sssss> here you go , la condesa , your 5th star ! <sssss> thank you !
?		i 'll keep this short and sweet . <sssss> snobby waiters/waitresses ridiculous wait times delicious pizza service is an important part of a dining experience but it 's not everything , hence why they only lose 1 star from me . <sssss> there 's not a whole lot they can do about the wait times . <sssss> this place is extremely popular and it 's not a very big dining space . <sssss> you can expect to wait 3 + hours if you go on a busy friday or saturday night . <sssss> you can pass the time waiting over at their adjoining bar bianco , or across the way at the rose & crown . <sssss> if you 're just wanting to try their pizza and not really looking for the whole bianco experience , you can call in your order and pick it up . <sssss> this is something i 've done a number of times and the pizza is just as good to go as it is served directly to your table . <sssss> parking can be a pain though . <sssss> they only offer valet parking and the lot is n't very big . <sssss> i would recommend parking in the heritage square parking garage on monroe . <sssss> if you 're heading south on 7th street , turn right on monroe and go about a block and park in the structure there . <sssss> do n't forget your parking ticket so you can get it validated , though if you 're waiting more than 3 + hours for a table you will exceed the validation stamp . <sssss> sometimes you can find metered parking on the street on monroe . <sssss> if it 's after 6 or 7pm , i believe the parking is free .
?		cheba hut is a place i love and hate . <sssss> i love the quality of the sandwiches and the fact they 're toasted ! <sssss> they have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks , and a variety of tasty desserts . <sssss> i hate how it can be hard to order your food cause the cashier or sandwich maker is high and slow as shit . <sssss> the weed theme is amusing , but it can only go so far before it affects the quality of the service and the work ethic that a business has . <sssss> numerous times i have had rude , stoned jerkoffs answer the phone and treat me like i 'm a fellow piece of shit stoner with all the time in the world , which is bullshit . <sssss> i know other people have had the same problem and the management needs to address this ; tell your employees to leave the herbage for their own time , and to bring their a-game to work !
?		i only gave this joint three stars because of their classic cocktail menu . <sssss> not many bartenders make old fashioneds or singapore slings anymore , and i love the fact that they have a variety of old drinks , plus a huge list of good scotch and other spirits . <sssss> it does bother me that some people , mainly hipster trash , will frequent this place and enjoy these drinks just for the fact that they 're vintage , old , classic , aka hipster gold . <sssss> also , the food was n't too compelling . <sssss> i ordered a steak sandwich , and it was so so ; the steak was a little too gristly to enjoy . <sssss> the ambiance is definitely a hip , modern vibe ; that can be good but not here . <sssss> places like this should cater to all the denizens of the area , not just some asshole beardo with a ski cap and an english degree from evergreen state college .
?		i could n't find anything wrong with avanti . <sssss> five starts across the board ! <sssss> to starters , the decor is amazing . <sssss> it is right out of a scene in goodfellas , or even scarface . <sssss> think elegant 80s chic , right down to the zebra striped chairs . <sssss> the service is spot on ; this is n't your chain joint with some struggling actor as your server . <sssss> all the servers here know their menu and their wine pairings . <sssss> the food is the icing on the cake ! <sssss> everything here is authentic italian , and it is downright delicious ! <sssss> the boo and i had bruschetta as a starter , then moved on to the pasta trio with the gnocchi , vodka sauce penne and fettuccine alfredo . <sssss> everything was creamy and cooked to perfection , and we finished with their tiramisu , which was divine . <sssss> drinks were strong and were perfect ; they have an excellent martini here ! <sssss> all in all five stars , this is an excellent place for birthdays , romantic dinners , and special occasions . <sssss> avanti has lots of character , check it out !
?		prettyyyyyy prettyyyyyy prettyyyyyy good ! <sssss> everything that 's been said about the chicken and waffles is pretty much on point . <sssss> went here for breakfast and in addition to the chicken and waffles , i had the breakfast fries -lrb- chili cheese fries topped with an egg and green onions -rrb- which were fraggin ' awesome . <sssss> opted for the sweet tea this time , and was n't as sweet as i had expected but still good .
?		this place was a pleasant surprise ! <sssss> the interior as other yelpers described it is pretty sterile , but the food is far from that ! <sssss> first off i 'd like to point out that jungle curry -lrb- which i ventured to try for the first time here -rrb- is the epitome o ' the opposite of favoritest things in the universe . <sssss> they gladly took it back and exchanged it for the massaman curry . <sssss> that being said , i love lamp ... ... and this place . <sssss> the massaman curry was rich , creamy and curryful , and with the help of the tableside chili powder bowl , all kinds of spicy ! <sssss> spicy deep fried fish ? <sssss> fuggedaboutit ! <sssss> not a whole fish as i was expecting , and only about 6 good sized pieces , but lawd haveth mercy , it was phenoms . <sssss> the mound of fried basil atop was a very nice and tasty touch . <sssss> crying tiger was the bees . <sssss> granted i am a steak lover and the steak was cooked a little longer than it should be for medium rare , the dish was guud .
?		first off , 1 star off for the lavosh . <sssss> i had the lavosh shawarma wrap , it was super tasty , but after eating it , it felt like i had eaten an entire box of captain crunch aka the world 's sharpest cereal , and the roof of my mouth cursed at me . <sssss> really . <sssss> the spanakopita -lrb- spinach/feta phyllo concoction -rrb- and the hummus were yummskis . <sssss> reasonably priced , friendly staffed , delicious fewd . <sssss> will def return
?		this place makes me a happy girl . <sssss> it 's just bonus that it 's next to the trader joe 's i frequent . <sssss> they sell both new and used books which imo is pretty awesome . <sssss> they have a decent selection of used books but not the best or it could be that they just sell out of the good used stuff quickly . <sssss> they have a fun selection of novelty items and a cozy atmosphere . <sssss> i could spend hours in here looking at everything .
?		two words . <sssss> emerald chicken ! <sssss> i chose to have mine in a quesadilla and it was fabulous , but it also makes a mighty fine burrito ! <sssss> newbs ... make sure to get a lesson in ordering because it will be a bitch if you do n't know what you 're doing and also make sure to taste everything they offer you . <sssss> it 's all so very delicious . <sssss> i also really like the jade chicken . <sssss> it 's not what you 'd think when you hear asian mexican fusion ... it 's much better !
?		oh monkeypants and i go way back . <sssss> the first time i went i thought i could hang with my 21yo neighbors ... we had a fantastic time . <sssss> great drinks , fun atmosphere . <sssss> younger crowed but it wasnt full of college aged jerks . <sssss> make sure to stick around for the 1:00 shirtless shot , it 's free so that means it 's something everyone should be involved with ... at least once .
?		great place to watch a game ! <sssss> our neighbors introduced us to this place and we love it ! <sssss> it 's a great place to go and have a few beers and watch the game . <sssss> it became somewhat of a weekly tradition for us . <sssss> great beers -lrb- and a damn good bloody mary ! <sssss> -rrb- good food ... and all around good place to hang out . <sssss> it tends to be rather noisy there , even on a non game day/night so i definitely do n't recommend it as a date spot unless you do n't plan on doing a whole lot of talking = -rrb- they have a decent brunch menu on sundays but i prefer their regular menu items .
?		ugh , these places are terrible . <sssss> i 'm not really sure why the husband and i decided to give them another shot , maybe because they 're in a nicer part of town or maybe we were just being nice , who knows . <sssss> we decided to go inside the restaurant this time to see what they were all about and it 's just a little overwhelming and quite a bit claustrophobic . <sssss> there is so much going on in here , with a huge backlit menu above the registers , a good number of tv 's blasting some basketball game , and the cacophony going on in the kitchen . <sssss> after about 10 minutes of trying to figure the menu out , we decide to order and then wait about another 10 minutes while the guy pushing the buttons figured out how to do a stupid cheeseburger with just mayo and ketchup . <sssss> we waited a little while for our food to come out and the same look of disappointment from my last experience spread across my face when i saw my burger . <sssss> i got an ill formed patty with ridiculously cripsy edges and haphazard construction . <sssss> i ate it and it really sucked . <sssss> at least i did n't get sick this time . <sssss> the only good things about this place are their fried cheese curds and some promising concrete flavors . <sssss> aside from those two things , i will never eat anything else from here again .
?		i 'm not sure why but i am always hesitant to go to restaurants attached to hotels . <sssss> it could be from a bad experience in my childhood that i do n't quite remember , but i think it 's starting to go away . <sssss> the husband and i decided to come here because we are leaving for washington for 6 weeks this weekend and we were on a mission to only try new places to eat our last weekend here . <sssss> we stopped by for breakfast on saturday morning . <sssss> there were very few people in here , maybe 5 or 6 tables so we were immediately seated . <sssss> our server was super nice in that cool-mom type of way . <sssss> she got our drinks quickly and refilled them often . <sssss> after a couple minutes perusing the menu and seeing lots of tasty things , i decided on the rock and roll waffles , which is a thick waffle with bacon and eggs sitting on top of it . <sssss> every time i order something like this , where there is supposed to be stuff on top of something else , they always serve it on the side . <sssss> oh well . <sssss> the husband and i also decided to split a cinnamon roll as a pre-breakfast app . <sssss> the cinnamon roll was delicious . <sssss> it was sweet and gooey with just the right amount of cinnamon . <sssss> it was also one of those fabulously soft and chewy ones , not a crusty one . <sssss> it was especially delicious with a little bit of butter on it . <sssss> my waffle was also fantastic with a crispy outside and a surprisingly fluffy interior . <sssss> i did n't so much like the scrambled eggs , they were kind of flavorless , but i do n't really like eggs anyway , so it does n't matter . <sssss> the bacon was pretty good , nice and salty and a little bit thick . <sssss> i will definitely go back again in the future . <sssss> i loved the old school vibe going on with this place and i love that i get better food at a better price with better service than i would get at any denny 's or ihop .
?		i 've never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building , so my first impressions may be a bit different from others . <sssss> i have always adored this house . <sssss> it 's absolutely adorable and in such a good location . <sssss> i read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening , so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later . <sssss> we chose to go right after work , so there were only a few other people in here . <sssss> i really like the setup with the bar in it 's own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house . <sssss> we were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window . <sssss> while we perused the menus i could n't help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin ' . <sssss> i ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat . <sssss> the food was very good . <sssss> the sourdough bread was super toasty , literally grilled to perfection . <sssss> there was a ton of cheese in the sandwich , but i do n't remember which kinds . <sssss> the important thing is that it was really tasty . <sssss> my only complaint is that the cheese was n't ooey gooey . <sssss> it was melty , but i could still make out the shape of the cheese . <sssss> in my book of grilled cheese greatness , it needs to be a little messier . <sssss> the sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose . <sssss> the chips were good and i ate them all up . <sssss> there was also a dill pickle , but i do n't do dill pickles . <sssss> i definitely think that this is a killer new spot that will do very well . <sssss> i have no doubt that this ultra-hip but non-pretentious spot will quickly become a neighborhood favorite .
?		we tried the turf on their big opening night . <sssss> they had a band playing some great irish music at a volume that i could actually still communicate with my husband . <sssss> there were even a few girls who got up to do that step dance business during a couple songs . <sssss> i 'm not sure if they were with the band , with the owners , or just so happened to be eating at an irish pub dressed like irish step dancers . <sssss> when we first walked in , their was no hostess table , just like seamus mcaffrey 's so we spotted a booth in the back and nestled in . <sssss> unlike seamus though , there were no menus at the table , so we had to wait a few minutes before we were noticed and given menus . <sssss> in the meantime i noticed that there was absolutely nothing on the table . <sssss> it was a refreshing change from most places where you see salt , pepper , ketchup and all sorts of other crap on an otherwise beautiful dark wood table . <sssss> we ordered the kids corndog bites as an app , a corned beef and cabbage for me , and a bangers and mash for the husband . <sssss> the corndog bites are wicked good . <sssss> they should make it a full size entree . <sssss> they 're super crispy and perfectly battered . <sssss> a side of seasoned waffle fries comes along with it . <sssss> the fries were also super crispy and delicious , and i do n't even like waffle fries . <sssss> i had never had corned beef and cabbage , so i did n't know what to expect . <sssss> the meat was very tender and slightly salty . <sssss> paired with the slightly softened and piping hot cabbage , it was certainly a winning combination for me . <sssss> the steamed carrots and baby potatoes were also tasty . <sssss> i could have used a bit more seasoning in the veggies though . <sssss> i did n't try any of the bangers and mash , but i did try the gravy and it was excellent . <sssss> thick and salty , just the way i like it . <sssss> feeling very satisfied , but ready to get the full experience , we ordered the whiskey cake . <sssss> whoa ! <sssss> i was not ready for it . <sssss> the bundt style pound cake was dense , soaked with whiskey , and served with fresh whipped cream . <sssss> i mean soaked . <sssss> i took one bite and could n't eat anymore so i scooped up and ate the foamy fresh whipped cream covered in green clover sprinkles . <sssss> all in all , a positive experience . <sssss> i will definitely be back . <sssss> the staff just needs to learn to be extremely watchful of new faces in the crowd so they do n't sit unattended for too long .
?		i 've been to a sprout 's before , but that was quite a while ago , so on my recent visit i was really pleased with what i was presented with ! <sssss> i like the layout of the store . <sssss> it 's definitely a little different than your typical grocery store , but it makes sense . <sssss> i also like that their aisles are very short , so you do n't have to break your neck to see what 's at the top . <sssss> i loved their selection of produce and i really liked seeing a lot of local offerings . <sssss> the carrots from tolleson are very good . <sssss> some of their produce prices , like on apples , are unbelievably cheap compared to other grocery stores ! <sssss> i had a lot of fun browsing this store and everything they have to offer , and i think we might be adding sprouts to our weekly grocery trips .
?		a while back we picked up some sweet italian sausage from the farmer 's market and we kept it in our freezer . <sssss> finally we broke out the good stuff to make our own bangers and mash and it was delicious ! <sssss> the sausage is flavorful yet mild and the insides are really tender and they crumble when you cut into it . <sssss> you can just tell by looking at it , that this is good stuff . <sssss> it also smells wonderful as it 's cooking . <sssss> i really enjoyed it and thought it tasted great . <sssss> i will definitely be sampling more of their meat .
?		i do not like this dave & buster 's . <sssss> let me start by saying i am a ridiculous , goofy , immature big kid at heart . <sssss> i love arcades and the only thing i love more than that is winning tickets to spend in the prize store . <sssss> this location makes me mad though . <sssss> just because i act like a kid does not mean i want to be rubbing elbows with your little rugrats . <sssss> i know this is a kid friendly place during the day , but for goodness sakes make them behave ! <sssss> there are screaming rude children all over here ! <sssss> i was playing one game while being poked and prodded by a 5 year old wielding a balloon sword . <sssss> not cool buddy . <sssss> if you want to let your kids run and scream and misbehave , take them to chuck e cheese or peter piper , but d & b 's is not appropriate for that . <sssss> i should also point out that a lot of their machines `` forget '' to pay out and a good portion of them will just rip you off in general . <sssss> i also hate that i have to go upstairs to go to the main event . <sssss> that 's not cool at all . <sssss> i hate this d & b and i will not go back .
?		there is n't much to say about matt 's other than they have the best damn breakfast in the valley . <sssss> you have to appreciate a homegrown diner where the owner makes everyday appearances , his wife runs the place , and they use the best , freshest , local ingredients . <sssss> kudos . <sssss> i get the hog and chick every single time i go , i never stray . <sssss> eggs over medium , hash browns , wheat toast , and the best damn bacon ever . <sssss> always perfect every time . <sssss> i have never tasted bacon so good in my life . <sssss> the hash browns are out of this world . <sssss> they get shredded super fine and are cooked up on the griddle in loads of butter . <sssss> the best . <sssss> if you want to seem cool and in the know , at lunch time order the insider burger . <sssss> it 's a traditional burger smothered in cheese , bacon added , and topped with an egg . <sssss> my brother loves it . <sssss> similar to a royal red robin burger , but obviously superior . <sssss> the only negative is the wicked crowd that can form for breakfast . <sssss> bring a lot of water with you and some sunscreen if you can brave the summer wait . <sssss> simply put , this place is amazing . <sssss> i am so lucky to be so close to this place . <sssss> sometimes to avoid the wait , my husband and i wake up at 6:30 on a saturday morning , head over for breakfast and beat the crowds . <sssss> after a hearty button bursting breakfast , we ride our bikes home and go back to sleep . <sssss> that is the life my friends . <sssss> you should try it .
?		hand 's down this place is my favorite store in phoenix . <sssss> actually , it 's my favorite store in arizona . <sssss> i would be hard pressed to find a place cooler than this that caters so exactly to my every need and desire as a baker . <sssss> i first came here when i was searching for a place to find cupcake liners in bulk . <sssss> i had just received an order from the school i work at to do cupcakes for their homecoming . <sssss> 400 of them to be exact . <sssss> ordering liners online would prove to be too pricey as would buying out every store 's stock . <sssss> somehow , even though i have driven by many many times , i did not even know this existed . <sssss> now i certainly do . <sssss> inside you will find a menagerie of things to delight everyone from the amateur baker to the professional pastry chef . <sssss> you will see rows of sprinkles , hundreds of cookie cutters , a rainbow of food coloring , dozens of specialty cake pans , and cake toppers galore . <sssss> i have never gone here and walked out unsatisfied . <sssss> i always find what i need . <sssss> if i could walk around this place with a plate of bacon from matt 's , i would seriously think i had died and gone to heaven . <sssss> if you are ever in need of anything related to cakes and cake decorating , give this place a shot . <sssss> you will never consult a big box craft store for your needs ever again .
?		if it were n't for the absolutely terrible parking situation , i would give this place 5 stars . <sssss> my husband and i have been driving by this place every single day after work . <sssss> it has been lots of fun watching the change from katz to postino . <sssss> finally , on monday , we drove by and saw it open . <sssss> we immediately turned around , and then around and around again trying to find parking . <sssss> we gave up and decided to plan on it two days later . <sssss> well , two days later arrived and we found a place to park across the street and next to the gas station . <sssss> everything else is worth 5 stars . <sssss> the service here was impeccable . <sssss> our server was both friendly and knowledgeable . <sssss> every server in the restaurant was attentive , i had seen a few different ones stop by our table to clear our plates or refill our water . <sssss> it was really nice to see servers that operated like a family . <sssss> the food was out of this world . <sssss> usually , i do n't get salads , but the raspberry chicken salad sounded too good to pass up , and it was wonderful . <sssss> it was very appropriate in size , and quite filling . <sssss> the raspberry dressing went so well with the gorgonzola and apples . <sssss> the lettuce was fresh and tasty . <sssss> the bread they served with it was also quite good . <sssss> i 'm going to guess it was some kind of blueberry walnut bread . <sssss> we also got a grilled cheese to share . <sssss> i love grilled cheese , and this one was fantastic . <sssss> they served it with three dipping sauces , mustard , ketchup , and pesto . <sssss> all three of them were excellent with the sandwich . <sssss> their wine list seems to be pretty well rounded but i do n't know anything about wine . <sssss> i love that postino is on the way home from work . <sssss> the relaxed vibe of this place makes me really comfortable in here whether i am dressed up from work or wearing jeans and a t-shirt on a weekend . <sssss> phenomenal place .
?		we had originally attempted to come here a few months ago , but our friends decided it looked `` too cheap , dirty , and gross . '' <sssss> ugh ... we swore that we would come back next time we were out in the neck of the woods and i am really glad we did ! <sssss> the restaurant is located in an average looking strip mall and the interior is just as average . <sssss> that 's fine by me though . <sssss> like someone else said in their review , at least i can see where their priorities are . <sssss> i ordered the 2 meat combo with shrimp and crawfish tails . <sssss> it was served with my choice of side , and i went with the cole slaw . <sssss> i was surprised at how flavorful the cole slaw actually was . <sssss> the shrimp were big and their outsides were really crispy . <sssss> they were quite yummy . <sssss> there were tons of baby crawfish tails , battered and fried like the shrimp . <sssss> those were also yummy and quite succulent . <sssss> i really really enjoyed my meal . <sssss> if you come here , do n't make the mistake that i did and not notice the yummy seasoning on the table . <sssss> i did n't notice it until after i was full , but i sampled it , and it was delicious ! <sssss> i will definitely come back here next time i am in the area .
?		we were n't in the mood to go to some boring chain and we were n't having a whole lot of luck searching for breakfast places because we had already been to most of them . <sssss> after getting a little deeper in the search , the husband suggested this place . <sssss> i was immediately surprised when we walked in by the sheer amount of tables and chairs they managed to pack into this tiny little restaurant . <sssss> this is definitely not a place to come and eat if you have personal space issues . <sssss> while it was extremely busy inside we were immediately seated at a tiny table for two and greeted by a sweet lady named sue . <sssss> i ordered the country breakfast with bacon so i could try a little of everything that this place had to offer . <sssss> my meal came with 2 eggs , bacon , biscuits and gravy , fried potatoes , and the awesome little muffin basket everyone has talked about . <sssss> the little muffin basket served pre-meal like bread at an italian restaurant is why i give this place 4 stars instead of just 3 . <sssss> everything else was average but good . <sssss> the prices were fair , the amount of food was plentiful , and the service was quick and friendly . <sssss> i could definitely see myself coming back here if i am in this part of town .
?		usually a frc place is a pretty safe bet for me . <sssss> unfortunately , i did n't really feel that way about zinburger . <sssss> on the particular day we chose to visit zinburger , we had already eaten and true food , just down the way , went to a movie , and then it was time to eat again . <sssss> since we were n't terribly hungry , but the opportunity to eat again would n't present itself for a while , we decided to share some food here . <sssss> we each got a shake and then the samburger -lrb- a bacon burger -rrb- and the sweet potato fries to split . <sssss> my shake was fantastic . <sssss> i got the creme brulee shake . <sssss> if my review was based solely off of my shake , this would be a 5 star review , but it 's not . <sssss> the sweet potato fries were good , but only without the sauce . <sssss> i honestly thought the yogurt sauce was disgusting and inappropriately paired with the fries . <sssss> something sweeter would have made more sense . <sssss> the burger was , well , just a burger . <sssss> i was sad that it was n't anything special . <sssss> it did n't taste any better than anything else i have had before . <sssss> too bad . <sssss> unfortunately , our service here was awful . <sssss> harold , or whatever his name is , was rude and snotty and pretty much ignored us for most of our meal while he chit chatted and shmoozed other tables . <sssss> he definitely showed his displeasure that we were splitting our food , making our bill smaller . <sssss> i do also have to make mention of the inappropriate placement of the hinges on the men 's restroom door . <sssss> read glenn 's review for a more thorough account , but yeah , it was gross . <sssss> thankfully debbie porter informed me that they were installing a screen or something to fix the problem . <sssss> for future diner 's sake , i hope so . <sssss> the more i think about it , the more i am sure i wo n't be back . <sssss> there are just way too many other burger joints around town to try and revisit .
?		i have been really hesitant to start visiting bbq joints because of a lot of recent strikeouts . <sssss> i 've always been so disappointed to maintain that my favorite bbq place is famous daves -lrb- boo chains ! <sssss> -rrb- i finally gave in and decided to give andrew 's bbq a shot . <sssss> walking into the shop , we were pretty confused . <sssss> there was a giant space in the wall that lead to the kitchen and then a large open area with tables , a pass through window and a cooler on the side . <sssss> we were n't sure if we sat down and waited for someone to help us or where we supposed to order . <sssss> thankfully a girl came out and was extremely friendly and helpful . <sssss> i want to say her name was dana or something very close to that . <sssss> i ended up ordering the 1/2lb chicken plate which came with a piece of jalapeno cornbread and a side , i picked coleslaw . <sssss> the food did n't take very long to come out and it looked wonderful . <sssss> i 'm pretty sure the cook was feeling generous because i got wayyyy more chicken than i ordered , but i 'm not complaining . <sssss> it was lunch for two more days . <sssss> the first thing i tried was the coleslaw and it was refreshingly different . <sssss> it was tangy and slightly sweet with some herbs i 'm not quite sure of . <sssss> my best guess is dill . <sssss> the chicken was quite good , but a tiny bit dry . <sssss> it still retained all of its great flavor and was only made better by the amazing bbq sauce . <sssss> i have been on a search for the greatest bbq sauce , and this is definitely a contender . <sssss> it 's thick and rich , kind of sweet , a little bit spicy , a little smokey , but a whole lot of flavor . <sssss> i really loved it ! <sssss> i think they sell it , and i may have to purchase some . <sssss> overall , i was really pleased with andrew 's bbq , but i would like to come back and try their brisket and maybe another side before i determine where they fit on my scale of barbecue greatness .
?		this place is pretty decent , nothing spectacular though . <sssss> we went one day after driving past this place for months . <sssss> we just always thought it was closed down or something , it never looks open . <sssss> the place is a decent size , but not too large . <sssss> you can create your own stir-fry , which i should have done , or you can just make a selection from the menu . <sssss> the husband and i chose the menu and got sweet and sour chicken . <sssss> it was pretty good . <sssss> run of the mill asian food really . <sssss> the portion was really big though and the price was fairly low , so that is always a major plus . <sssss> it was n't bad . <sssss> i will probably visit again out of curiosity . <sssss> i really want to make my own stir-fry . <sssss> yum !
?		i certainly do n't understand the hype over this place . <sssss> that 's strike 2 for you guy fieri -lrb- # 1 is chino bandido , bleh -rrb- . <sssss> the layout of this restaurant is very strange , but i kind of like that they separate the large groups from the smaller groups of diners . <sssss> the staff , especially our server , was extremely accommodating and put up with our certainly frustrating antics of playing board games on the dinner table . <sssss> i was pretty hungry when we got here , so i decided to order something on the heavier side and went with the gnocchi . <sssss> the gnocchi were lightly pan fried and then drowned in a ridiculously rich cheese/cream sauce and sprinkled with chunks of pancetta and a handful of wild mushrooms . <sssss> the mushrooms tasted really weird for some reason and the sauce was too tangy . <sssss> it just did n't complement the dish the way it should have . <sssss> i did however , eat every last bit of pancetta . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> i saw a slice of german chocolate cake -lrb- no , it is not german in the least bit -rrb- being served to someone at another table and i gave the puppy dog eyes until we ordered it . <sssss> it came out looking rather impressive , but it went down tasting rather dull . <sssss> it was dry and lifeless and the only good part , the coconut pecan icing , was severely lacking . <sssss> well , i wo n't be back here , especially after most of my companions were less than enthused with their meals instead . <sssss> oh well , i guess that will make everyone else happy .
?		i 'm not really sure where to start with sens other than i have to admit that i was disappointed . <sssss> i am a huge fan of tapas , and after hearing that an asian tapas place was going to be opening only minutes from my house , i knew i had to go . <sssss> we decided to go for my birthday , bringing along a couple of friends . <sssss> my disappointment comes a lot from the service . <sssss> we walked in the door and saw maybe 4 other diners in the place . <sssss> we stood for about 5 minutes waiting to be seated . <sssss> a bartender and 2 servers ignored this and continued chit chatting and rolling silverware , a task usually designated for times when you have nothing to do . <sssss> this was not one of those times . <sssss> when we finally got someone to pay attention to us , we were seated and given menus . <sssss> the waitress never asked for our drink order , which irritated me . <sssss> the menu looked great . <sssss> there are lots of options , all of them creative and inspiring , especially when pei wei and china chili are the extent of your asian culinary knowledge . <sssss> we ordered a small assortment of dishes to get a well rounded taste of the menu . <sssss> we chose the papaya mango springroll , 5 spiced chicken wings , sugarcane pork , and one more thing , but i ca n't remember . <sssss> here comes the next disappointment . <sssss> these are small bites for 2 people not 4 . <sssss> i 've been to a few spanish tapas places , and all of them provide enough food for 4 people to taste . <sssss> i understand tapas are essentially snacks , and not meals , but please explain to me how i am supposed to split two messy chicken wings among 4 people ? <sssss> the food , i liked for the most part . <sssss> the chicken wings were delicious and tender with a ridiculously tasty spice rub/marinade . <sssss> the sugarcane pork was also crazy good . <sssss> it was sweet and crispy and really moist . <sssss> the spring rolls however i thought were revolting . <sssss> they tasted like grass and i could not find any papaya in there . <sssss> oh well , the husband liked them and ate them . <sssss> we ended up leaving after being rather unsatisfied , both in our bellies and mouths , and headed over to hanny 's -lrb- we were better off staying at sens. -rrb- you know , i did n't really like sens the first time around , but as i write this review , i think they need another chance . <sssss> this time i will go with just my husband . <sssss> i suppose this is probably a good place to go as a couple . <sssss> if you want to go with larger groups and still want to feed everyone , i suggest lola tapas .
?		i 've been here two times and both times i have been pretty pleased with what i have ordered . <sssss> they serve quality food here , have speedy services , and the prices are pretty easy on the wallet . <sssss> the belgian waffle sandwich is pretty good . <sssss> i will warn you though , do n't order this and expect it to be served like a sandwich . <sssss> it 's more like a plate with a waffle , bacon , and eggs on the side . <sssss> kind of weird , i just figured if i ordered a sandwich , all the good stuff would be smooshed between the waffle . <sssss> that 's okay , i quickly remedied and mortified the old people sitting nearby as they watched in horror as i clutched my waffle sandwich like a cavegirl and tore in . <sssss> haha , i love freaking old people out . <sssss> i have also had the three musketeers omelet , and this guy is a beast of an egg creation . <sssss> it is completely packed with all the good stuff -lrb- bacon , sausage , and cheddar -rrb- and then it is topped with an overly indulgent , rich hollandaise sauce . <sssss> there was no way i was going to finish it , but it was very tasty . <sssss> another good thing about this place is that they have speedy and efficient service here . <sssss> they get you your drinks quickly and take your order as soon as you set your menu down . <sssss> then your food will come out so quickly that you will swear the cooks have telepathy . <sssss> definitely a good place to go for breakfast .
?		i 'm always in search of great coffee and this place has great coffee . <sssss> it 's a little place and if you blink , you might just miss it ! <sssss> the staff was knowledgable on their coffee and equipment . <sssss> it reminds me of the type of place you would find in downtown phoenix , but instead it 's in scottsdale .
?		this location gets so jammed packed that its like chaos during the lunch rush . <sssss> i have always had great tacos here , especially the chicken is always hot . <sssss> has anyone else noticed that their seating is quite uncomfortable ? <sssss> i just ca n't sit for too long , but i think that is all part of their plan , they do n't want their patrons to stay for too long . <sssss> one thing i need to add is chipotle does not use dairy products in their meats , rice , tacos shells/tortillas/chips or salsas . <sssss> it is a fabulous place to eat if you have a pesky food allergy .
?		in my opinion , one of the best steakhouses in town . <sssss> my husband and i go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal . <sssss> the service is the best just like their steaks . <sssss> i recommend the caesar salad , fillet , creamed spinach , cream corn , garlic and lobster mashed potatoes . <sssss> we will continue our tradition and keep coming back here .
?		after reading the previous reviews , i do n't feel i have much to add except that you must come here ! <sssss> the food is incredible . <sssss> i love the pierogies and blintzes are to die for . <sssss> this is seriously good food .
?		i am giving flamingo palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any chinese restaurant i 've tried in phoenix . <sssss> i like bamboo house and superdragon , too , but this is by far my favorite . <sssss> my in-laws are chinese food experts . <sssss> i never thought we could get them to like chinese food in phoenix as they are from new york , where good chinese food lives . <sssss> but they love flamingo palace . <sssss> every time they visit us , they ask to go there . <sssss> i just had my book club there and they were so awesome ! <sssss> we had heaps of food and each was better than the next . <sssss> plus , the service was just amazing - this with 13 people in our group . <sssss> i had such a pleasant , stress-free experience . <sssss> they gladly substituted chicken for pork , and as other people have noted , their chicken is the good stuff . <sssss> also , they are very generous with shrimp , meat , etc. . <sssss> people in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu , which i 've never really noticed before . <sssss> i 'm not much of a drinker . <sssss> but everyone really enjoyed the plum wine . <sssss> it was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other chinese restaurants . <sssss> for example , try the house flamingo chicken . <sssss> it is so good . <sssss> we wiped out their szechuan chicken , it was spicy and fantastic . <sssss> i also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp . <sssss> yum !
?		i went here with my foodie friends not expecting a whole lot . <sssss> i 'm not that into bbq . <sssss> but this place rocked my world . <sssss> unfortunately , it also caused me to gain a few pounds . <sssss> but it was totally worth it . <sssss> everything , from the ribs to the sides were sinfully delicious . <sssss> i ca n't think of anything to improve on at this place .
?		love the food here ! <sssss> wish i had the money and time to go here more often . <sssss> must order items from what i 've tried so far : guacamole with pomagranate seeds chiles en nogada cochinita pibil pork enchiladas del mar fish tacos churros rellenos -lrb- dessert -rrb- omg , i 'm hungry just typing this .
?		not bad , but no great shakes . <sssss> the `` large '' pulled pork sandwich was hefty , but kinda bland . <sssss> lots of sauce helped . <sssss> sweet potato fries were underdone and way too cinnamon-sugared . <sssss> service was indifferent . <sssss> you can get better barbecue in plenty of places in phoenix .
?		love this place . <sssss> inspired , creative , and beautifully prepared farm-to-table cuisine . <sssss> just got back from 2nd time here and it confirmed that the 1st dinner was no fluke . <sssss> nicely diverse menu , love the use of seasonal and organic veggies . <sssss> everything i 've ordered or tasted here -lrb- duck three ways entree special , pork osso buco entree , various appetizers , sides & desserts -rrb- has been outstanding . <sssss> service has always been warm and attentive , even on an uber-busy saturday night . <sssss> like the open kitchen and the whole vibe here ; energetic but not too loud & hectic . <sssss> enjoyed the 50 % off sunday night special on arizona wines -- surprised my out-of-town snobby parents -lrb- `` arizona wine ? <sssss> that ca n't be any good '' -rrb- with a wonderful keeling schaefer syrah . <sssss> prices are way reasonable -lrb- entrees $ 12 - $ 21 -rrb- for the quality and portions . <sssss> a great evening out .
?		really good , really unique . <sssss> i had never had ethiopian food , but we went out with -lrb- vegetarian -rrb- friends who recommended it , and we 're always game for something new . <sssss> super-friendly owner and waitstaff . <sssss> the food was super tasty and lots of fun . <sssss> i decided to pass on the meat dishes and go veggie like our friends did , and we had a wonderful array of stews . <sssss> i ordered the vegetarian was terrific . <sssss> a couple of lentil dishes , chickpeas , split yellow peas , string beans w/carrots & onions , and a potato/cabbage mix . <sssss> really tasty , and fun to pick up the stews with the injera -lrb- kind of like a firmer crepe/pancake . <sssss> reminded me of eating a mix of moroccan , lebanese and indian foods . <sssss> so good . <sssss> the iced black tea -lrb- with cinnamon , cardamom & cloves -rrb- is a great accompaniment . <sssss> we 'll be back .
?		concept resides squarely between in-n-out and five guys . <sssss> good fast-food burger , but not much more . <sssss> ca n't compete with delux , zinburger & the grind , but it 's cheaper & faster . <sssss> upsides vs. in-n-out are topping variety -lrb- mmm , bacon & bbq sauce -rrb- , superior side options -lrb- sweet potato fries and onion rings -rrb- and char-broiling vs. flat-top grill . <sssss> a bit pricier , though . <sssss> nice for a change of pace , perhaps .
?		what you 've heard/read is all true , this place is terrific . <sssss> $ 1 street tacos were all amazing -- loved the al pastor , carne asada was wonderful , chorizo was excellent , and the fish my wife ordered was as good as any i 've had . <sssss> the mole plate was to die for ; a little spicier than usual , but rich and complex . <sssss> delicious churros stuffed with flan and drizzled -lrb- honey ? <sssss> caramel ? <sssss> do n't know & do n't care -rrb- as promised , the owner/operator is just a sweet , funny bear of a man . <sssss> order at the counter and he 'll bring you your tray . <sssss> taste is right up there with fuego tacos and la condesa , but a lot less expensive -lrb- four of us ate wonderfully for $ 25 -rrb- . <sssss> eat there before word gets out .
?		i take my clothes here to sell at least once every season . <sssss> it takes quite awhile ... even if there are only one or two people in front of you . <sssss> the atmosphere is fun and if you have the time to go through the racks you can usually find some cool stuff . <sssss> this is definitely one of the better second hand clothing shops ... although there is a ton of stuff everything is very well spaced out and they only take things in immaculate condition .
?		what make some burros is their hot sauce . <sssss> what usually makes my friends and i crave some burros is their hot sauce . <sssss> as with all mexican restaurants , their hot sauces usually vary and some are different . <sssss> i do n't know how well i can explain their sauce other than it 's red , it comes with your food , it has lots of pepper seeds , and it 's just the right amount of hot . <sssss> we go through a ton of it . <sssss> i do n't understand why they have a bean burrito , plain , you have to add cheese ... but when you add the cheese ... yummers . <sssss> their tortillas are nice and soft but thick and strong at the same time . <sssss> when i ate meat , i discovered their shredded chicken and bean burrito . <sssss> holy cow ! <sssss> most juicy and tender chicken ever ... so delicious with beans and of course i added cheese . <sssss> it seems like a crime to even put sauce on this particular burrito it 's so good . <sssss> the rice here is good . <sssss> i usually do n't eat crunchy tacos because of the oil and shell but they do n't serve them soft here ... and let me tell you ... their shredded beef taco is yummer-ee-no ! <sssss> enchiladas good , quesadilla good , chips and hot sauce , yeah yo . <sssss> overall , standard taco shop prices , consistent food , good quality , hot sauce it great , and plus one for having a pick-up window for phone orders .
?		such a great find ... so thankful to my friend who introduced me to defalco 's . <sssss> it 's an italian deli/store that also serves up a full menu of food . <sssss> i usually order ahead and either eat it there or take it to go as during lunch they get very busy and you usually end up waiting for your food for quite awhile . <sssss> the prices are soooo good and they make everything fresh . <sssss> check out their deli counter with their fresh salads . <sssss> love the fresh mozzarella , tomato , and basil sandwich . <sssss> i get my sandwiches on their sub roll . <sssss> when i ate meat i 'd get the same sub but add prosciutto . <sssss> drizzle evoo and balsamic vinegar and you are ready to get your grub on . <sssss> oh yum , their chicken parmigiana sandwich is a large amount of tender chicken in their homemade red sauce covered in melted mozzarella ... what 's not to like about that ? <sssss> their pastas and stuffed pastas are fabulous ; eggplant parmigiana and stuffed shells are great ! <sssss> the pasta dishes come with a side salad and garlic bread . <sssss> this has a comfortable family feel and it 's always fun eating here , i would definitely recommend it !
?		the old spaghetti factory ... well not this one , this one is very new . <sssss> the one in phoenix-not so great . <sssss> very bland ... the food and service were not great . <sssss> i did n't want to go back but decided to try this newer location . <sssss> i have already been to the chandler location twice now ! <sssss> amazing deal for tasty food . <sssss> i usually have iced tea with dinner , as we all know , drinks are about $ 2.50 added to your bill ... not here , the iced tea comes with your meal ! <sssss> you get an iced tea , hot tea , or coffee -lrb- yes , soda you do have to pay for -rrb- , fresh piping hot bread with a garlic butter , a house salad or cup of soup -lrb- they 've had a yummy and hearty , vegetarian minestrone both times -rrb- , your entrée -lrb- which are super cheap ! <sssss> -rrb- , and a cup of vanilla ice cream or italian spumoni -lrb- which is one of the better spumoni 's i have had -rrb- . <sssss> i honestly do n't know how they can afford to give so much food , for such a little price . <sssss> two people , that many items for $ 25.00 ? <sssss> that 's crazy ! <sssss> just remember people ... just because your bill is less than other places does not mean you should tip off of the bill ! <sssss> think about the service your getting -lrb- mine has been out of this world fabulous both times -rrb- and all of the work that is involved -lrb- dishes , refills , courses , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> tip on both price and service , then add a bit ... do n't be stingy . <sssss> now for the entrees ... i have gone off of recommendations both times , and both times i was n't disappointed . <sssss> the first time i went i tried their specialty the mizithra cheese & browned butter pasta -lrb- only $ 9.99 -rrb- . <sssss> i was n't sure what to expect but it came highly recommended . <sssss> this was a very rich and scrumptious dish . <sssss> it was a blast from the past , like a classier version of butter pasta you eat when you 're a kid . <sssss> i could only eat about half of it since it was so rich but my friend and i really enjoyed it ... she ate more of mine than her own . <sssss> i do n't blame her , she got the fettuccine alfredo and it was not very good . <sssss> the noodles were overcooked and the sauce was very bland ... more like a milk based sauce instead of a nice creamy and cheesy sauce . <sssss> the second visit i tried another recommended dish , the lasagna vegetariano -lrb- only $ 10.50 -rrb- . <sssss> four cheeses , alfredo sauce , layers of noodles with fresh artichoke hearts , yellow squash , and zucchini . <sssss> the top layer has carrots on top which i thought was a very unique and yummy idea . <sssss> then everything is topped with marinara sauce and delicious sautéed mushrooms . <sssss> the presentation of the dish was very nice and the dish overall was not extremely flavorful , but considering it was vegetarian i thought it was very good . <sssss> i would get it again .
?		maggiano 's - this is a bit of a drive for me so i 've only been once but it was a delightful experience . <sssss> entrée prices are reasonable ... our bill added up quickly because we had quite a few add-ons . <sssss> three people for lunch ... i think our bill ended up being around $ 95 or so after tip . <sssss> we all had a beverage to start , soda and iced teas . <sssss> service was pretty slow but we were in no rush as it was a birthday lunch and our waiter was friendly . <sssss> the entire lunch took about two hours and it 's not because we were eating slow . <sssss> we started with the mozzarella marinara - breaded mozzarella , served with marinara sauce . <sssss> let me tell you ... i am not one to order appetizers usually as they are usually $ 10 extra on your bill and too much food . <sssss> this is the one exception i will always make ! <sssss> this was fresh mozzarella ... not sticks , but two giant squares ! <sssss> the breading was perfect and their marinara sauce is the best i have tasted ! <sssss> this was such a nice treat and well worth the price ! <sssss> they did bring some bread which was probably pretty good but it does n't stand out too much in my mind . <sssss> we all had a different salad before our entrees . <sssss> as most of their salads included meat , i ordered their plainest house salad ... this salad was very sad and not worth the $ 5 or $ 6 it cost . <sssss> the other specialty salads looked good but mine was literally iceberg lettuce with a very sad , very light coat of italian dressing . <sssss> my salad looked dry and boring ... and that 's exactly how it tasted . <sssss> it 's okay though because the entrée more than made up for it ! <sssss> all three of us were in complete disbelief and shock but the entrees we ordered were listed under classic pastas , which apparently include an additional take-home dish ! <sssss> if you order a classic pasta , you get any classic pasta to take home . <sssss> they are in foil baking pans with instructions and have been pre-made but not yet cooked . <sssss> i was so excited because it meant i would get to try multiple dishes ! <sssss> fyi ... as these dishes are pre-made , you ca n't make modifications to them . <sssss> i ordered the four cheese ravioli for my entrée to eat there . <sssss> it 's ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese , cream cheese , mozzarella and provolone . <sssss> served in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce with a touch of marinara . <sssss> beautiful presentation and they tasted delightful . <sssss> the sauce was very nice but i may just get marinara sauce next time ... yes , it is that good ! <sssss> for my take home dish i had the eggplant parmesan . <sssss> this was very easy to make and oh my gosh , it was sooo delish ! <sssss> sliced eggplant , breaded and fried , layered with provolone cheese and marinara sauce , served with a small portion of spaghetti marinara that had lots of chunks of fresh garlic cloves ! <sssss> besides my salad , and i guess on a normal day i could never wait for lunch that long , the food was amazing ! <sssss> i had a great experience . <sssss> oh and to top it off ... they gave us some lemon cookies for the birthday treat . <sssss> they were perfect to share , light and lemony . <sssss> i also liked that they had this as an option on the dessert menu ... it gives you a lighter and more affordable option if you 're craving a little sugar after your meal .
?		big fan of hula 's been a bunch of times , but finally was compelled to write a review . <sssss> just came back from a week in maui , so i was still in `` hawaii-mode '' -lrb- which is soooo hard to get out of lol -rrb- , so i insisted we go to hula 's to get my hawaii fix . <sssss> mainly ... that just means i was dying for a good mai tai . <sssss> if you go here , you must order a mai tai . <sssss> while most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting , the mai tai is the best in town -lrb- now that trader vic 's is donzo -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm a mai tai snob , and cringe when most mai tai 's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity . <sssss> the mai tai at hula 's could rival some of the best in hawaii in my opinion . <sssss> mostly rum -lrb- white and dark -rrb- and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour . <sssss> they go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it , so be careful ; -- rrb - ! <sssss> as far as the food ... its good , but its not roy 's so do n't except anything amazing . <sssss> i usually get fish here , just to go with the whole hawaiian thing . <sssss> most of the times i 've had mahi , it can be dry sometimes , but always tastes good . <sssss> ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted , both are decent . <sssss> the luau pork plate is darn good , but my recommendation is get the luau pork sandwich instead . <sssss> it goes so much better on bread , than just by itself . <sssss> all the appetizers are great to munch on while you 're enjoying your mai tai ... all thats missing is hawaiian music , and the sun setting over the ocean : -rrb-
?		finally went to brio today , for lunch . <sssss> first thing i said when we walked in , `` are they owned by cheesecake factory ? '' <sssss> the atmosphere is cheesecake factory-esque , with a tuscan flare . <sssss> the menu is pretty big , nothing really stood out to me on it though . <sssss> their brunch menu items looked like they had some potential but i was not in a brunch mood unfortunately . <sssss> had the lobster bisque to start , pretty good , but i 've had better . <sssss> -lrb- the lobster bisque at ocean club really spoils you ... lol -rrb- sister had the beef carpaccio appetizer ... which was huge . <sssss> it 's a huge , long plate of thinly sliced carpaccio with a small bunch of mixed greens in the center ... it was pretty good , but nothing that i went crazy over . <sssss> had the pasta alla vodka for entree and again , pretty good but nothing amazing . <sssss> they are little ricotta filled pasta purses -lrb- do n't know the technical pasta name for them , so that 's how i 'd best describe them ! <sssss> -rrb- , in a delicious tomato/parmesan/vodka sauce with smoked bacon . <sssss> very tasty , but not life changing . <sssss> food wise , it kinda reminded me of an olive garden , but a little more upmarket . <sssss> maybe if olive garden made love to a cheescake factory ... you 'd end up with a brio tuscan grille ?
?		had to write them another quick review since my first review of tutti 's . <sssss> tutti santi has become my only italian restaurant that i 'll go to in phoenix ... folks it simply is the best in town . <sssss> i 've become a regular here , and the entire restaurant treats you like family ... its always a joy coming in here . <sssss> if i could rate them 10 stars , i would . <sssss> everything i 've tried on the menu is outstanding ... their pasta 's are some of the best i 've ever tried . <sssss> i could go on and on about this place , but i 'll just keep it simple ... go here ! <sssss> and sit at the bar with deb ... she will take wonderful care of you .
?		what a neat little place . <sssss> we went around lunch time , but they serve the breakfast until 5 - i was a little bummed they did not serve their famous pizza until starting at 4 ... oh well , a reason to come back ! <sssss> i had what was called the commuter sandwich - whatever kind of meat you want , eggs , tomatoes on their home made english muffin ... wow is all i can say - soft and melt in your mouth . <sssss> not what you would think from a english muffin ... i also had a blueberry muffin - it was , without a doubt , the best i have ever had . <sssss> i wish this place was a little closer because i would be here all the time . <sssss> it was neat too , because i also saw ryan sandburg -lrb- chicago cubbies legend -rrb- eating here . <sssss> i did n't get my stalk on and ask for an autograph , but it still was cool to see him there . <sssss> i grew up watching him lol . <sssss> anyway - ca n't wait to go back to this place .
?		ok , but not as good as san tan marketplace one . <sssss> i had the `` poncho villa '' and it 's basically a red chili burro . <sssss> was a little to bitter for me , but wife loved it . <sssss> next time i 'll stick with tacos & enchiladas .
?		great burger , not the best i have ever had , but good . <sssss> great service . <sssss> good atmosphere . <sssss> i had the fries too , and they were steak fries style and nom nom . <sssss> they have a huge variety of food to try , and the people i went with had the pasta salad and various sandwiches ... i will go back to this place if i find myself in the area , or if i need another business meeting out in that area of the woods ...
?		all i had was a pepperoni and pineapple pizza and hands down it was the best pizza i have ever had in the phoenix area . <sssss> the crust was light and just flat out tasted amazing . <sssss> i wish it was closer to me in queen creek . <sssss> do yourself a favor and check this place out . <sssss> the whole group loved their pizza too . <sssss> agreed it was some of the best they have had in the area .
?		i 'm giving this one a 4 because i first ate at -lrb- and found out about -rrb- lucilles at the vegas location . <sssss> over there it was spectacular - here its just amazing . <sssss> they give you so much food its unreal . <sssss> you can try anything bbq you want or ever dreamed of . <sssss> you get these amazing biscuits with this butter stuff that is just like candy before the meal , and almost get full just with these . <sssss> so much food , go hungry and get ready to be amazed . <sssss> some of the better bbq in the area . <sssss> i look forward anytime i have the opportunity to visit a lucilles . <sssss> just ca n't wait till i go visit the vegas one again !
?		small interior , great little patio just off the main drag in old town scottsdale . <sssss> the place is easy to find because of its funky lodge look it is totally out of place for the neighborhood . <sssss> i think the place is suffering from an identity crisis . <sssss> on one hand it is trying to be a old town scottsdale meat market , but on the other hand it is trying to have a down home kind of feel . <sssss> the burgers and sandwiches are huge with huge buns . <sssss> nothing fancy about the fixings and the food is overpriced but i guess they have higher rent where they are located . <sssss> if this place were in phoenix or tempe it would be 35 % less .
?		a nice place to take a date or the wife for a little romance . <sssss> women just melt for fondue you know . <sssss> french and swiss cuisine . <sssss> they place has nice small appetizers and boatloads of crepes either for dinner or dessert . <sssss> my only knock is the price . <sssss> you know that there really is n't anything to making a crepe or fondue but places like this jack up the price just because it is french . <sssss> c'mon people , it is basically either just an egg or cheese . <sssss> i would also like to chime in on denise 's review . <sssss> c'mon knocking a french place because they have foie gras is stupid . <sssss> you might as well write a bad review about every french restaurant on the planet .
?		this place has grasped the concept of the slow food dining experience but not in a good way . <sssss> the place was virtually empty and it still took forever to get our food . <sssss> i ca n't even begin to imagine what this place would be like on a busy night . <sssss> if it was n't for the groupon i think we would have felt totally ripped off . <sssss> for old town scottsdale the prices are what you would expect , overpriced for what you get , the food was nonetheless tasty when it did arrive . <sssss> a nice selection of beers added one star to my review .
?		imagine a hooters where the girls cut their outfits in half . <sssss> that is about the only reason to go to this place . <sssss> it 's a decent sports bar for guys to hang out in but not for familys or with your wife . <sssss> lots of beers on tap , unfortunately they serve them at ice cold 29 degrees temperature which is ok for your bud light , coors light drinker but for craft beer it should be served at around 40 degrees . <sssss> hello mcfly !!! <sssss> food was typical bar food for the most part with a few modern choices . <sssss> the meatloaf is more like just a hamburger patty than real meatloaf imho . <sssss> the place specializes in breasts , and not chicken breasts .
?		located in a non descript strip mall and that alone will turn away a lot of people ... for shame . <sssss> because inside you will find some tasty craft brews from firestone , papago , four peaks , oak creeek , san tan , and o'dells . <sssss> the burgers are the house specialty and will satisfy any burger lover . <sssss> get the one with the egg on top and you are in chloesterol heaven . <sssss> nice pool tables and friendly bartenders in aq place that is trying to make craft beer work in a non craft beer environment . <sssss> ps sweet potatoe tots are to die for .
?		great asian place , eclectic menu of chinese , vietnamese , thai and japanese . <sssss> fair pricing . <sssss> excellent service . <sssss> love the beef and onion dish . <sssss> could be the best asian place in town imho for the overall package . <sssss> .
?		a nice smaller place with good beer and live music , a few pool tables that give yhe place a real unique vibe . <sssss> had a decent selection of bottles and about 8 taps of microbrewed beer . <sssss> prices were reasonable and the service was pretty good although it was n't all that busy being summer .
?		located just off mill ave. when the weather is nice it has a great patio . <sssss> inside is a total dive . <sssss> pretty decent food but it is a total drunk fest type of place . <sssss> lots of asu kids and a whole host of regulars whose sole purpose in life is just to hang out and get drunk .
?		some good things and some bad things about this place , first the good-happy hour prices are good 1/2 price beer and wine , the bad-normal prices are too high with small pours . <sssss> food was cheap but lacking any real pizzazz , you pay for what you get . <sssss> the biggest negative was slow service . <sssss> 10 minutes to take an order and then another 10 to deliver drinks is n't acceptable . <sssss> this place is not related to the handlebar in mesa or scottsdale .
?		north scottsdale sports bar type atmosphere . <sssss> great four peaks beers but the food is certainly subpar when compared to the main brewery in tempe . <sssss> the advantage it has over tempe is that it has air conditioning but beyond that tempe is the four peaks to hit .
?		sort of like a poor mans version of ruth chris 's steak house or a rich mans version of frasher 's steak house . <sssss> food was good but not great . <sssss> service was very good . <sssss> plenty of wine choices but very limited beer menu . <sssss> i find it a shame when you have a nice place that thinks that wine is cultured but beer is not .
?		as soon as we got word that class was canceled for the day we hit road with one destination in mind : matt 's big breakfast . <sssss> this was my first experience with matt 's ; my classmate is a little more cultured that i am , so he knew the ropes from previous experiences . <sssss> there really is n't a lot that the general public can use for parking near the restaurant , but i used my university parking pass to park in the asu lot right across the street . <sssss> even though we went on a tuesday morning the place was still packed . <sssss> but the 20 minute wait was n't bad because the weather was as nice as the outdoors waiting area . <sssss> once we were seated -lrb- in pretty close quarters i might add -rrb- our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately . <sssss> i got the honey lemonade which was such a great -lrb- and different -rrb- combination . <sssss> my classmate and i ordered the same breakfast entree : the five spot sandwich with a side of homestyle potatoes . <sssss> sweet mary , the bacon on the sandwich was literally perfect . <sssss> everything tasted fantastic and complimented each other so well . <sssss> i will eat here again whether or not my class has been canceled !
?		i want to create a time line showing how bajio went from my favorite early release destination way back in high school to its current situation . <sssss> i can only guess that the brief period that the restaurant closed down only to be reopened under new ownership was the tipping point into bad food territory . <sssss> thanks to henry ford , this place uses an assembly line to create the americanized mexican food that it churns out for its customers . <sssss> i usually get a plain bean and cheese burrito because i 'm not a big fan of most of their toppings . <sssss> i 've always liked that the food comes with free chips and salsa . <sssss> i 've tried other menu options like salads and chicken burritos , and everything is just so-so . <sssss> i want this place to return to its former glory with the shouting for tips such , but i think that the current environment is here to stay .
?		i 'm glad that living in the southwest has benefits other than excessive use of cacti in home decor . <sssss> one of those benefits is the food served at z ` tejas , and i will gladly put up with any number of hanging serapes to get my hands on tex-mex . <sssss> this is what you need to order -lrb- no exceptions -rrb- : 1 . <sssss> drinks : chambord margarita 2 . <sssss> appetizer : cornbread -lrb- so moist ! <sssss> -rrb- 3 . <sssss> entree : seafood enchiladas 4 . <sssss> dessert : berry cobbler . <sssss> you will need to take a food coma after you have successfully finished all this food . <sssss> but , and trust me on this one , you will finish it because everything they serve is addictive . <sssss> i would have literally licked the cobbler pan if i was not in public . <sssss> your pants will be bursting to make up for the weight that your wallet loses over the course of this meal .
?		you know that scene in every `` small town girl goes to the big city movie '' where the stereotypical `` small town girl '' sees the city lights for the first time ? <sssss> she gets this cheesy look in her eyes like she finally found her way home . <sssss> i 'm pretty sure that i had that same nauseating look on my face when my date walked me through bomberos ' door . <sssss> but everything was perfect . <sssss> with candles and well-groomed plants everywhere , the flagstone paved courtyard is an absolutely beautiful entrance to the dimly lit restaurant . <sssss> the former sunnyslope firehouse is all exposed brick which looks amazing in candle light . <sssss> the little round tables facing a live music area just completes the intimate feeling of the restaurant . <sssss> we ordered glasses of sangria and bruschetta to munch on while we watched the latin band . <sssss> everything was fantastic looking and tasting ! <sssss> my only complaint is that the restaurant was a little too noisy to enjoy a sustained conversation . <sssss> this is the perfect place for any sort of date . <sssss> from that awkward first dinner to `` friday night date night '' this place will put stars in your partner 's eyes .
?		i have only been for happy hour , but it is a five star fare ! <sssss> my high status man candy and i had several margaritas over chips and salsa all for under $ 20 . <sssss> the casa margarita is a little sweet , but very good once the ice melts a little bit . <sssss> i was slightly disappointed that they did n't offer a blended option , but i was happy enough with on the rocks . <sssss> the chips were light and crunchy and came with three different salsas . <sssss> i liked the brownish green stuff the best -lrb- sorry , the real name escapes me -rrb- . <sssss> the tomato based salsa looks and tastes like marinara sauce and the pico is way too chunky . <sssss> the decor is adorable ! <sssss> i loved everything from the ikea lighting fixtures to the over-sized dia de los muertos skulls . <sssss> i also liked the half the bar was inside and half was out because it really opened up the area . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back for more !
?		it hurts to write a 1-star review for this restaurant . <sssss> that being said , do not alter a time-honored and familiar recipe . <sssss> there is nothing wrong with an addition to the recipe , as the additions can be requested left out of the order . <sssss> however , it is wrong to replace ingredients that make up the basic presentation of the recipe . <sssss> this afternoon , i found myself in mesa for a shopping trip to mekong supermarket . <sssss> we have a potluck event coming up at work and i wanted to scope out the place ahead of time for the ingredients i will need . <sssss> seeing the sign for thai spices , the trip offered a chance to stop for lunch after i checked out mekong supermarket . <sssss> on entering the establishment around 1:30 pm , i observed a clean dining room , with a pleasant ambience . <sssss> on picking up the ` take it home ' version of the menu , i read through and saw what appeared to be suitable offerings for a thai restaurant . <sssss> as always , i looked for som tom , green papaya salad , the yardstick by which i measure all thai restaurants . <sssss> finding green papaya salad listed , i was gratified . <sssss> with no indication whether i should seat myself or wait , i waited . <sssss> from entering to being greeted and offered a table , it was about 5 minutes . <sssss> there were about 10 people seated in the restaurant , so the wait was , in my perception , reasonable . <sssss> when the host came to me , he asked if i would prefer their table menu . <sssss> i responded that i found what i wanted , and i would like to be seated . <sssss> as i was guided to a table , the host advised i would see my wait person shortly . <sssss> he asked what i would like for my beverage and was quick to bring the water with lime i requested . <sssss> my waitress arrived shortly after and asked what i would be ordering . <sssss> i placed my order for papaya salad , omitting shrimp and long beans , served thai hot , along with an order of steamed jasmine rice . <sssss> the waitress asked if i could clarify my order , hot being 1-5 . <sssss> i requested 6 . <sssss> she wrote down the order and asked if i wanted another beverage in addition to the water . <sssss> i declined , and she went to the kitchen , advising i could anticipate a wait of 7-10 minutes for my order . <sssss> sipping water , i waited for my order to arrive . <sssss> my order was presented at about 8 minutes . <sssss> the salad looked to be reasonable , about 2 cups and the rice about 1 cup . <sssss> som tom , properly made , should have lime , chile , palm sugar and fish sauce , each of which brings tangy , sweet , salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya . <sssss> on tasting the salad , i got lime , vinegar , garlic and spicy notes . <sssss> the spice was about 5 on a scale of 10 -lrb- 5 makes my nose run , 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes -rrb- . <sssss> i caught the waitress ' eye and when she came to the table , she asked if everything was satisfactory . <sssss> i told her that the salad was missing some ingredients , specifically fish sauce and palm sugar . <sssss> she apologized and took the order back to the kitchen . <sssss> 3 minutes later , she returned with the same order , though it had been doctored with fish sauce and granulated sugar . <sssss> the chef had not remixed or even replated the order , only put fish sauce and granulated sugar on top of the previous order . <sssss> i asked the waitress to return this version to the kitchen and requested a new presentation be made , without the vinegar . <sssss> she went to the kitchen and returned with the same plate , telling me that the chef would not make a new order . <sssss> i asked for the bill , and requested consideration as the order i wanted was not what i anticipated . <sssss> the waitress apologized and asked if i wanted to speak with the manager . <sssss> in replying that i would , she said the manager would meet me at the register . <sssss> i went to the register and on asking for consideration , the manager advised me that the salad was prepared exactly to my order , with no beans and no shrimp . <sssss> when i asked why vinegar was used instead of fish sauce , she said `` that is how it is listed in the menu . <sssss> did you not see that ? '' <sssss> i paid my bill and left . <sssss> oh , i have regrets ... yes , i have many regrets .
?		yelp , your mobile app has taken me home again ! <sssss> it 's nice to have a spot that has not significantly changed in the 20 + years that i have been a patron ... even tho nearly 20 years has passed between my last visit and my most recent . <sssss> casey moore 's oyster house patio was the spot one of my instructors selected for the lecture portion of his class . <sssss> every tuesday , from 2-3 :30 pm , we sat at a table and discussed designing costumes/lights/sets / sound for asu theatre productions . <sssss> between the munchies and the black and tans , our discussions became quite animated and we certainly considered more creative design concepts . <sssss> it was quite cool to be able to have class and a beer -lrb- or 3 -rrb- at the same time . <sssss> fast-forward from 1989 -lrb- my first experience at casey moore 's -rrb- to 2011 -lrb- my return to tempe for work -rrb- . <sssss> the food is still outstanding , the location is easily accessable , the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable . <sssss> the prices , unfortunately , are a bit higher than other places .
?		clean , comfortable and a very nice place to see a movie . <sssss> i go often and look forward to returning .
?		i walked in and it was the first time i had ever been to a smashburger . <sssss> the place was not too brightly lit -lrb- 5 guys get a clue -rrb- , had nice seats , it was clean and had a very good first impression . <sssss> i had followed a young couple in and it was obvuious they were on a date so it was good enough for them to pick as a destination . <sssss> menu greeted me at he doorway so you could a have a look at it , proceeded forward to order and the wait staff was polite and nice . <sssss> definitely upscale from the competitors . <sssss> food arrived quickly . <sssss> i had read yelp reviews , so was prepared and had the 1/3rd smashburger , sweet potato smashfries and soda totalling just under $ 10 . <sssss> music was a little too loud in the dining room , the burger was tasty , but as soon as i raised it there was a puddle or juices that dropped out . <sssss> it was fresh and i liked the generous veggies on it . <sssss> the sweet potatoe fries were mystifying ; did n't know whether to put ketchup on them or not . <sssss> they also had an italian herbal flavor -lrb- oregano , basil ? <sssss> -rrb- and while tasty are not something i 'd normally order . <sssss> summary : very nice place , good food , good ambience and just a tad out of the ordinary to be striking .
?		saw the crowds as i drove by and stopped in . <sssss> fantastic prices on mexican grown produce , reasonably good selection , but many of the items such as peppers and berries had already started to turn . <sssss> the shopping experience brings this down from a 3-4 star review to a one star ; be prepared to get pushed , shoved and elbow checked by the professional shopping senior ladies who will run you down roller derby style under full court press . <sssss> the check out counter is fast as those guys can sense the desparation of the crowd . <sssss> not for the faint of heart but definitely some great values and i did survive . <sssss> open til 7pm and i wonder if those elbowed ladies retreat before then
?		nice place in the middle of a residential area making it a quaint local spot . <sssss> really enjoyed the pacifico on tap -lrb- $ 4.25 / glass -rrb- and the nachos gustivo pequeno -lrb- $ 9.00 for small -rrb- . <sssss> a bit pricey but still a fun place .
?		tried this in tempe but in a quick moment of haste i asked for the works and it came that way - my mistake as i hate ketchup and mayo on burgers as it disguises the flavors and both were included , but that was my fault . <sssss> vowed to try it again and when i did i omitted those offenders and it was great . <sssss> came out promptly , result was good , tasty and far better than the competition -lrb- in-n-out -rrb- . <sssss> mid priced burger was good value and the burger seemed of comparable caliber for price . <sssss> the meat was flavorful , the bun soft and they sported crisp veggies . <sssss> order was exactly correct on delivery . <sssss> a bit pricey , but not that bad overall . <sssss> free peanut starters are a real plus as you wait - somebody was thinking on their toes for both client 's hunger and preoccupation . <sssss> ps - note on comments that compare this place to in-n-out , i do not consider them competition as i have seen in-n-out as a filthy , dirty place where fries are scooped across the counter and back into the serving bin . <sssss> i searched on in 'n out 's website and it does n't allow you to report it -lrb- like they do n't care . <sssss> end of rant -rrb- .
?		i was a little disappointed in pearl . <sssss> the sushi was outstanding but the presentation , service and environment left much to be desired . <sssss> first , the good . <sssss> they had a very large selection of sushi and all day happy hour . <sssss> our food was excellent . <sssss> however , the resultant was so hot , we almost felt nauseous by the time we were finished eating . <sssss> the plates that our food arrived on were badly chipped . <sssss> the waiter kept touching us -lrb- patting on back/brushing against us -rrb- which was uncomfortable . <sssss> the last issue was that our soup was served after we received our entrees which was very odd . <sssss> over all , i probably wo n't be back to pearl .
?		love that the flavors change frequently ! <sssss> great way to beat the heat !
?		love southwest . <sssss> they are typically friendly , efficient and well priced !
?		great bucket specials ! <sssss> usually live music and one of the best spots for people watching -lrb- if you sit on the top deck you can look out on to the mall -- hours of entertainment ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		great service , friendly staff , excellent food ! <sssss> this location is in the mall so it has a limited menu . <sssss> i just wish they had more options from their regular menu -- like pizzas and a food happy hour !
?		my favorite place to eat in the valley ! <sssss> i love postino ! <sssss> they have the best buscetta in the world . <sssss> they have some interesting combinations and they all work very well together . <sssss> the service is great ! <sssss> the vibe is very chill .
?		awesome place ! <sssss> food is good , staff is friendly , there is usually live music and it is authentic southwestern .
?		az 88 has a very chill feel . <sssss> it reminds you of an upscale bar without the high prices . <sssss> the food is good quality bar food . <sssss> the place has a good vibe . <sssss> the house music is provided by a dj at night . <sssss> there is also art work through out the restaurant . <sssss> fun place !
?		what a nice surprise ! <sssss> i was initially afraid to try fez because i heard they were connected to metropolis -lrb- metropolis is a joke of a restaurant so-so food and untrained staff -rrb- fez was a delight ! <sssss> great atmosphere , super service and excellent food ! <sssss> i had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries . <sssss> the fries were to die for , some of the best in the valley . <sssss> the waitstaff was attentive and knowledgeable . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and try more from their menu !

?		kemta and al were my sushi chefs last night at shimogamo and they were very friendly and hospitable . <sssss> i finished work last night around 8:30 pm and was hungry for sushi . <sssss> they close at 9pm mon-thurs . <sssss> they welcomed me in , let me know it was no problem to serve me and were so great about it . <sssss> what great attitudes they have .
?		ashley was a great server . <sssss> she had a suggestion for everything on the menu . <sssss> we were there for happy hour which is everyday from 4pm-7pm . <sssss> when we ordered the fish tacos , she suggested adding a great verde sauce - which was n't on the menu . <sssss> i ordered the house margarita on the rocks . <sssss> they 're made from a mix and the first one was tasty and the second one seemed a little heavier on the mix . <sssss> happy hour margaritas were $ 2.50 .
?		mmmmm ... los favs ... their breakfast burritos are always on point and so is their carne asada which are my personal favorite in the state so far compared to -lrb- fillbertso -rrb- filly bs , and rubias in tempe on mill and southern ? <sssss> i think that 's the name of the other spot . <sssss> favs always get it right though for the most part . <sssss> lately they have been overcooking the french fries but it is still amazing regardless . <sssss> their burritos seem pretty small to me compared to taqueira me casita or whatever on warner and dobson but their california burrito is my quick i do n't really know what i want so i 'm gon na choose this option . <sssss> like i said , i usually get the carne asada fries or the breakfast burrito because you can never go wrong with either selection . <sssss> i seriously have been thinking about it all night and i am always more than excited to go every time . <sssss> i am a typical foodie so excuse the excitement as i text as i am preparing for my day of work and stop for my breakfast burrito along the way ; -rrb- i once ordered rolled chicken tacos and it was extremely bland and just meh . <sssss> i wanted to throw it away after i ate one out of three . <sssss> but my friend made me pack it up . <sssss> so not only did i end up wasting my food but i wasted a container . <sssss> i can not force down food just because that is definitely not my style to say the least . <sssss> living in arizona you will find hit or miss places , i have heard a lot of people say this is just as disgusting as filly b 's but i beg to differ . <sssss> filly b 's is just beyond nasty and my stomach always hurts after eating their overly salty carne asada fries . <sssss> gross . <sssss> okay back to favs . <sssss> i do n't necessarily care for the fact that they charge you extra for sour cream , cheese , etc etc etc in your burrito . <sssss> i am spoiled from the mexican spot down the street on warner and dobson because they load your burrito in front of your face with two scoops of rice , beans , and 2-4 scoops of meat depending on what meat and if u ask for half and half . <sssss> and let you add in sour cream cheese and whatever else for free . <sssss> the burrito looks as though its the size of some buff guys bicep . <sssss> honestly . <sssss> favs burritos are half the size of a regular sized girls forearm for 4 dollars compared to 6 . <sssss> their prices on breakfast burritos and carne asada fries are always in my budget though . <sssss> los favs here i come !!! <sssss> : d
?		i used to love four peaks up until my last visit and my boyfriends visit as of yesterday . <sssss> we have been loyal customers for the past 3 + years and we feel as though they are slowly making their way down the drain . <sssss> let me get into detail here ; my last visit the waitress did n't even know she picked up a larger section then she expected so of course we were over looked for a solid 15-25 minutes when my boyfriend decided to say something to someone . <sssss> so our waitress came up and apologized later with a half ass apology . <sssss> excuse my french . <sssss> we ordered right away , and it took forever to get anything . <sssss> so my boyfriend decided at the end of our meal and drinks with our friends to pick up everyone 's tab since the snooty waitress did n't split the check . <sssss> my boyfriends visit tops the cake to where i severely do n't want to go back . <sssss> so my boyfriend had ordered a beer and then came to realize a friends bday was that day so they ordered under 3 shots for the group . <sssss> after 3 shots they were cut off and they were n't even belligerent , weird . <sssss> okay , the thing that pissed me off the most is they accused my boyfriend that he received his pretzel when he sure as hell did n't get it and they charged him for it ! <sssss> nice !!!! <sssss> not . <sssss> supposedly they messed up our friends nachos as well . <sssss> lastly the waiter was a manager in the end since the first waiter kept messing up , when he cut off my boyfriend and his friends he said even though he has seen us there a lot he had to cut him off because what reason we will never know . <sssss> but what i can tell you now is that the new staff they have on board is n't the same and makes me not want to go ever again .
?		can we say overpriced ?? <sssss> the manager was beyond nice and comforting . <sssss> which was n't a problem if only the waitresses had the same attitude and attentiveness as their manager things would have been a little more pleasant in my opinion . <sssss> i hate it when they only time they want to ask if someone wants a refill is my boyfriends alcoholic bevareges . <sssss> it 's like geeze people my amazing lemonade has been gone for over 30 minutes and you do not want to ask me if i would like more ?! <sssss> yes i would have . <sssss> the food was severely minimal for the price . <sssss> i had ordered the thai shrimp and scallops with the coconut curry . <sssss> not bad . <sssss> but not good enough for 26 dollars . <sssss> i wish i had gotten their tiny filet instead . <sssss> just disappointed just like i am sure the rest of our large party was . <sssss> it seems like they barely asked anyone at our table besides my boyfriend if they wanted more beverages . <sssss> which i really quite sad if you ask me . <sssss> because with as little food they give you , you would think people might like a refill on whatever it is that they ordered drink regardless if it had alcohol in it . <sssss> i mean seriously its my hard to ask that question . <sssss> actually it 's more polite and expected of a waitress especially with as big of a table bringing in the profit off of gratuity . <sssss> probably the reason they felt they did n't have to do much since they are getting tipped anyways so i 'm sure they felt they did n't have to work for it . <sssss> sad . <sssss> if i 'm ever around the area i know where not to come for food . <sssss> an that would be this place .
?		i am upping my score by one star just because i do happen to love their food more right now . <sssss> their pizza is phenomenal along with a few other things . <sssss> i shall try their burgers tonight because its been long enough to where i cant remember how good they might be . <sssss> i know their turkey burger is amazing but its time for a change tonight . <sssss> i tried the honey hot wings last time and was n't impressed unfortunately . <sssss> the other night i was feeling totally adventurous and risky ! <sssss> sooo i tried the burger with the smoked gouda and bbq onions . <sssss> which had me confused because for once i can not recall ever trying bbq onions in my lifetime . <sssss> when they came after maybe 10 minutes later i did n't love the pairing of the gouda and bbq onions and ground bacon together . <sssss> now believe me ive had a 50/50 burger with ground beef and ground bacon . <sssss> san tan does not compare to the original 50/50 in california in any size shape or fashion . <sssss> it irritates me almost to even think back on how salty the burger was and the pairings with it did not work ! <sssss> at all . <sssss> i scraped off the onions and ate them with my fries which by the way was superb ! <sssss> so even though i gave them one extra star its mostly because their food has been hit or miss lately and i really love it when its on point and amazing .
?		honestly for the price i pay every time i walk in to any of the five guys establishments i feel like i am being ripped off . <sssss> i am not cheap but i am not out to spend 10 + dollars if i do n't feel like a. it will fill me up or b. it is too small and average for the price i am paying . <sssss> i understand things might be a little more customizable or `` fresh '' but if you want `` fresh '' for a great price just go to in and out or my personal favorite favorite restaurant for burgers/sandwiches is four peaks their food is good enough for me out here in arizona . <sssss> i was born and raised a northern cali girl so i had it good as far as food goes and i miss it but i have to settle and find what i can out here if i do n't end up moving back . <sssss> five guys is cool in my book that you can add stuff but i can add damn near whatever i want at four peaks and i do n't feel ripped there . <sssss> every penny is worth it in my book . <sssss> five guys no . <sssss> only if there 's nothing else close by i have n't tried or if i am too lazy and do n't wan na be adventurous and i am starving out of my mind where i just need quick food . <sssss> there is another problem with five guys and a reason i do n't really go to them often is that there are too many excited people standing in line for this food that is n't mind blowing good for how tiny their burgers are i would rather go to a in and out and pay half the price and be happy with my recent purchase . <sssss> like i said i have lived and traveled all over the world and do n't find this place that amazing to wait longer than 10 minutes not including the line just to place your order . <sssss> i will pass if i find other places close by which is n't difficult it is not like there 's a five guys literally in the middle of the desert with no surrounding places to eat .
?		oh wow i have n't written about this place yet ?? <sssss> crazy ! <sssss> let me just say first and foremost . <sssss> their cakes are delicious/decadent rich and moist and packing flavor !!! <sssss> -lrb- depending on which flavors i should say though -rrb- for example my personal favorites would have to be their white white chocolate , red velvet being my ultimate favorite , and their seasonal flavors in the fall . <sssss> do not go anywhere else for red velvet . <sssss> every time i crave it and do n't feel like baking it myself i just run to this same location and buy a little personal bundt size for about $ 3-4 or so . <sssss> it is addicting , i have tried red velvet from other bakeries such as frys , bashas , safeway etc etc and no one nearly comes close . <sssss> as far as service go its hit or miss , i am in and out fast so i do n't take time to really pay attention to their attitude but its never bad enough for me to knock them for it this time . <sssss> but that 's doing a lot to get me to that point . <sssss> you can read my other reviews for places that have severely poor service in the east valley and its pretty minimal i would say . <sssss> price wise for larger cakes is a little steep and i say this because if i wanted to replicate the cakes i can do it if i really wanted too its way too easy for me . <sssss> i have never bought a size larger than the personal size just because they are asking for way to much when i can make the same cake if not better for half the price . <sssss> ; -rsb-
?		oh my gawd - is what comes out of my wings stuffed mouth every time i eat the honey habanero wings . <sssss> even though i have only been twice -lrb- does n't seem like enough right ?! <sssss> -rrb- , each time i eat these messy little wings of delight -lrb- and yes i lick my finger after each wing is devoured -rrb- , the experience of the flavor and meat to bone ratio is beyond satisfying . <sssss> last time i tried the mild wings -lrb- since my boyfriend cant handle hot wings -rrb- they had some good spice but myself personally could go way hotter than that . <sssss> so i still have yet to try more flavors because i am always so tempted to just get the honey habanero but want to try more flavors at the same time . <sssss> the second trip convincing my boyfriend to come with made my wait time for this delicious masterpiece less boring also because we talked to the owner the whole time which i always always always love because i believe that owners that have great relationships with their customers make a successful business -lrb- +1 -rrb- ; like i have said time and time again ! <sssss> when owners lose that bond with customers you lose out on more customer flow in my opinion . <sssss> the place has tvs to watch espn while you wait -lrb- +1 -rrb- , two different refrigerators -lrb- coca cola and pepsi -rrb- with the correct products in both -lrb- +1 -rrb- -lrb- my stepdad has worked for coca cola my whole life practically so i notice everything that has to do with soda -rrb- kool aid and sweet tea -lrb- have n't tried yet either shockingly -rrb- -lrb- +1 -rrb- and desserts , specials and catfish -lrb- on steroids says my bf because they are such big pieces -rrb- ! <sssss> on my second trip i ordered 10 honey habanero and 5 sweet and tangy but whatever they put under the honey habanero i am not positive if they were really the sweet and tangy because i did n't taste sweet or tangy , just salt . <sssss> i love salty stuff but it just was n't exactly what i was expecting or loved nearly as much as the honey habanero . <sssss> but everyone has different taste obviously . <sssss> it does n't affect my thoughts on how much i love this place and they got my business and boyfriends and friends business forever and will promote new places such as this every chance i get !!!! <sssss> it would be awesome if they could open up a bigger spot like bww with a bar so they can play the fights i would much rather go there than bww any day just because the staff is beyond nice compared to any wing spot i have been too and lolo 's in phoenix and scottsdale combined . <sssss> update :05 / 08/2012 : a word of caution , if you received a text from atl wings about .50 cent wing tuesdays from 4-9pm make sure you ask about it unlike myself who paid full price not really realizing until i had left and did n't feel like going back asking so late . <sssss> the honey biscuits remind me of dense crispy gooey donuts i would have to share them with others because eating all those to myself plus 6 wings i feel like im in a severe food acoma now . <sssss> delicious and dense .
?		we love hanny 's ! <sssss> their desserts are amazing . <sssss> i want to try more but its so hard to stray away from the ones you are familiar with . <sssss> my boyfriend loves their pizza and i loved the pepperoni and sausage pizza . <sssss> so far we have only tried the chocolate crisp cake and the strawberry long cake but i always expect the long cake to sort of be like a short cake and the whole dessert is so cold so its kind of a shock to me every time i take that first bite . <sssss> my boyfriend loves the dirty martinis and the absinthe here . <sssss> oh also check out downstairs for something quite different and not normal .
?		i had gone to this location since i was in the area and craving a donut or two based on people had mentioned blueberry cake donuts which are my new fave . <sssss> but instead of trying just that i had picked out a old fashioned glaze which was literally to die for . <sssss> i have never been to the chandler store and eaten a freshly fried donut and had that warm amazingness melt in your mouth sensation unfortunately otherwise i would have remembered the experience . <sssss> as i broke apart my donut eating it while driving i was just completely blown away . <sssss> i am almost scared to go back to chandlers location and not get the same sensation . <sssss> now for the blueberry donut i was more than disappointed hence the 4 stars . <sssss> a couple days ago i was in huntington beach and had went to a donut shop off of beach blvd and experienced i live changing experience by eating their blueberry cake donuts/pumpkin and red velvet -lrb- ?! <sssss> -rrb- the blueberry was by far my favorite then pumpkin and red velvet coming in last as far as the flavored cake donuts . <sssss> so bosa failed to impress me with their blueberry which was like a pink color in the middle not really a bluish purple hue like the donuttery in hb . <sssss> so i will keep my eyes peeled for when those donuts are rolling out fresh . <sssss> oh last but not least do n't order boba smoothies at this location they suck and lack in flavor . <sssss> it just tasted like milk and ice blended together with not sweet boba on the bottom .
?		i fwicken ruv v thees praacce . <sssss> we ooda da foo lik one tim a wek . <sssss> we ru v v eve ting we ooda . <sssss> garlic chicken with brown rice chicken fried rice pei wei spicy chicken with white rice side of potsticker sauce seriously 1 time a week for the last 3 months or so . <sssss> the food is always on point and damn good .
?		pizza and wings hit a spot that had not been hit in awhile . <sssss> my 9 year old who had the flue 2 days ago ate 8 of the wings herself . <sssss> the pizza is saucy , meaty , cheesy goodness . <sssss> i would call this a classic pizza . <sssss> the wings were meaty and saucy with just amount of kick . <sssss> -lrb- medium -rrb- the service is great .
?		i was totally hoping for a bill and teds type genghis type guy to be running around smashing shit ... slightly disappointed when the hostess was a sweet snappy lady . <sssss> we were seated and drinks were ordered . <sssss> we were then ushered to the beginning of the food line and quickly `` learned '' on the art of msf . <sssss> fill yer bowl with meat , veggies , sauces etc. . <sssss> give to cook pick rice , noodles etc. . <sssss> my concern is making my own food taste like shit . <sssss> . <sssss> i prefer chefs that know how much chili sauce is too much . <sssss> . <sssss> my dish came out good , a ton of steak , some veggies , the genghis sauce and a little of some other one , and egg or two and some fried rice . <sssss> i was concerned about the portion but after concocting ... there was plenty ! <sssss> i did like the meat better here then at yc 's
?		sunday v-day empty and boring . <sssss> the service was oddly slow and odd in general . <sssss> the waitress was overly nice and i swear she was minnie mouse @ disney for a year or two . <sssss> the food was good but not great . <sssss> everyone liked what they had but no one had a overwhelming time . <sssss> the stadium was gross and ugly compared to the regular season vibrant green . <sssss> it seemed a little sad . <sssss> lol although i did not have anyone sitting with me while trying to eat , i did have a man cleaning his washcloths in the sink . <sssss> he was clean and friendly but i thought it was funny .
?		everything here is wonderful ! <sssss> the staff knows there stuff ! <sssss> the price is perfect for what you get ! <sssss> go here !
?		3.5 giving the extra .5 for the server . <sssss> i liked the decor the small feel the art work service from the bar the taste of the beef the size of the patty the cooked to order i did not like the toppings the price no side 's included the burger is a great hunk of beef cooked to order on a huge bun served with burnt bacon and cheddar cheese . <sssss> the burger was cooked to medium rare as requested but lacked the bark on the outside as i expected from a bazillion degree grill . <sssss> the toppings made the burger less appealing in my eyes . <sssss> it was an overkill . <sssss> plus the bacon had a burnt flavor . <sssss> i had great service from the bartender and enjoyed some mini donuts for dessert . <sssss> i would go back ... but will not be craving this one . <sssss> -lrb- which i had hoped for -rrb-
?		i rarly go to the theater so it usually is a treat to eat the greasy buttery mess of popcorn when i go . <sssss> the parking is not near as bad now that there is another theater up north . <sssss> friday evening around 7pm open spots left and right . <sssss> not an issue anymore the prices suck but if you are a poor student you should rent a movie ... lol the concessions are great , not hassle , not too slow , decent selection . <sssss> the theater rooms are normal and do have staduim seating . <sssss> the arm rests are movable , so if you need to cuddle your other you can . <sssss> the imax is slightly better , the screen is larger , and the sound is `` fantastic . '' <sssss> i would see an action flick here anyday . <sssss> the staff is all cool and the customer service is great . <sssss> we had to leave early from a wednesday showing and they gave us passes to come back . <sssss> we used them friday and there was not a problem at all .
?		this sunday after a great party on the cool bus the night before , we took the kids to see a flick . <sssss> - no line getting in -2 min wait at concessions - awesome job buttering the hot and fresh popcorn - ice cold dr pepper even if my buds were not tasting it correctly ~ why does that happen after a night of drinking heavily ? <sssss> - clean , comfortable , seats - nice picture and sound but the previews are always louder -lrb- the way it should be -rrb- then the flick itself . <sssss> turn it up ! <sssss> the whole norterra complex is getting more and more places to be and see . <sssss> it can be worth the drive .
?		i have been here 3 times . <sssss> 2 times to eat and once i forgot cash . <sssss> the first time was not great the fryer was down and the fry 's sucked . <sssss> the 2nd time was a little better . <sssss> except the food inspector was there . <sssss> normally this is a non-issue but in a diner car that serves 9 you hear and see everything . <sssss> we ordered 2 doubles and 1 fry and a bottle of coke . <sssss> one burger was made incorrectly as they added grilled onions to both . <sssss> i was feeling generous and did not ask for a new one . <sssss> -lrb- i should have though , i do not care for onions on the burger -rrb- the fry 's were good , in fact i could have eaten another order . <sssss> the cook andy and the waitress were so frazzled by the inspector they kept forgetting things like opening the bottle of coke , ketchup , other peoples meals , the `` regular '' got a double when he ordered 2 singles and made sure andy knew it was 2 singles ... the other `` regular '' looked as if she rolled out of bed , smoked a j , slapped her over sized headphones and ipod in her pj pocket and rode her bike here . <sssss> she totally dumped her bike in the front , like she owned the place . <sssss> andy asked several times for her to move it but pot head did n't get it . <sssss> andy asked the other regular to do something for him discreetly since the city guy was there , not sure what but he was outside for a while . <sssss> i like welcome but with 2 issues in 2 visits i dunno if i will be back .
?		friday 10/1/10 everything was great but we used an entertainment book discount and the waitress screwed it up 2 times . <sssss> the 3rd time it was within a couple bucks of being correct and the family was ready to go . <sssss> watch your bills a little closer . <sssss> saturday 10/2/10 ... dont judge me . <sssss> we started here for the bday dinner and a drink or 3 . <sssss> glad i used dd 'd the waitress was brand spanking new , but did a good job . <sssss> at least the bill was correct .
?		excellent food , fast service , excellent customer service , great prices . <sssss> exactly what a mom and pop store should be . <sssss> i had the 1/2lb -lrb- double -rrb- with standard toppings , cooked medium . <sssss> it was superb ! <sssss> they use a thinner sized patty then what i prefer but make up for it in taste , quality , and size . <sssss> i would have been slightly disappointed if i had ordered the 1/4lb one . <sssss> they char grill on a huge 560,000 btu cooking machine . <sssss> fast , hot and tasty . <sssss> great job my friends , keep it up .
?		finally brought my wonderful wife here ... we ate bread and pesto , more bread and pesto and a little more bread and pesto . <sssss> we also had chicken princesseola or something like that ... loved it . <sssss> except the risotto was mushy ... bad mushy we also had a pasta with sausage and stuff . <sssss> it was ok , just a tad boring . <sssss> the service was good , the price was fine , we too used a coupon and they had no issues honoring it . <sssss> the math was correct too . <sssss> lol
?		we have been here 2 x . <sssss> once for the pool party that they hold over the summer and once to stay the night -lrb- after the pool party -rrb- the pool is 3.5 ft deep most of the way around . <sssss> which makes it a perfect party pool . <sssss> they have a ton of seats , servers and people attending the pool . <sssss> some are hotel guests others come just for the party . <sssss> there are plenty of hot bodies and creepy old dudes ... i just described my wife and me ... shit . <sssss> the servers are attentive and prices are not too bad . <sssss> the food is decent and again not too bad . <sssss> the hotel is vegas in az and the rooms are awesme too ... some of the negatives ... the walls are thin or the doors are hollow or something . <sssss> we heard every person on and off the elevator all night . <sssss> i swear i was in vegas . <sssss> the buffet is nice and had plenty of food but none of it was great . <sssss> for $ 34 i was hoping for more .
?		i was tempted to give 5 but will reserve that for the next meal . <sssss> i came here several times before actually being able to eat . <sssss> they were closed all the other times . <sssss> check the days and hours before you go . <sssss> it was a date night with my lil one . <sssss> she wanted to go someplace nice and have sparkling apple cider , yeah really . <sssss> she forgot about that when they brought her a hunk of pizza dough to play with . <sssss> it was really fun . <sssss> we made food dishes out of it and acted like she was the chef . <sssss> le franc was the name of the fancy new table diner . <sssss> she had spag and meatballs . <sssss> i thought the sauce was nice but the balls were a bit squishy . <sssss> nice flavor but i like my balls firm . <sssss> you know ? <sssss> i had the cheese tortellini with marinara and alfredo . <sssss> yummy it totally hit the spot . <sssss> the best part was the bread and pesto . <sssss> i seriously ate like 6 hunks of bread and the crust of the lil ones . <sssss> i would have licked the bowl of pesto if no one was there . <sssss> the cheesecake drizzled with chocolate sauce was a nice finish . <sssss> i can not wait to go back in the nicer months and enjoy the wonderful patio . <sssss> service was excellent and the place was packed . <sssss> in fact there were only two servers for the entire place .
?		great food ... good service excellent management good drinks 115 tv 's -lrb- guesstimate -rrb-
?		yes ! <sssss> yesterday i decided to eat whatever i wanted and what do i go do ?? <sssss> of course i go to a place with chicago in its name ! <sssss> being one of those many people in phoenix from the chi , i can definitely say that this place has the right stuff ! <sssss> if it were a little more compact and there was n't a mountain to look at outside , i would almost think that i was back home ! <sssss> but enough about that . <sssss> let 's get to the food ! <sssss> i had a slider , a 1/3 lb cheddar and some fries . <sssss> all this was under $ 10 so the prices get a thumbs up ! <sssss> flavor-wise , the food kicked my mouth 's ass ... the slider had me saying , `` white castle , what ?? '' <sssss> the fries were crispy on the outside and soft/hot on the inside -lrb- which is pretty much perfect -rrb- . <sssss> lastly , the burger ... oh the burger . <sssss> yeah , if you 're craving a juicy , cheesy , greasy and all around mouthwatering burger , look no further . <sssss> every bite made me take a look at the burger and think of how good it was . <sssss> it is safe to assume that i 'll be back to this place to try more of their food . <sssss> next time i 'm definitely getting a chi-town dog ! <sssss> = -rrb-
?		uhhhh ... fair food ... i 'm sleepy . <sssss> i went down to the state fair today to walk around , check out the attractions and eat the food . <sssss> i 've been to fairs and carnivals before and i thought i knew what to expect , but i definitely found myself surprised a couple times . <sssss> sweet potato corn dogs ? <sssss> deep-fried everything ? <sssss> my girlfriend and i made the decision to share whatever we got and boy was it a good idea . <sssss> here 's what we had : deep-fried bacon - meh , in the flavor department ... cowboy fries with gravy - made me think of canada ! <sssss> turkey leg - get one ! <sssss> deep-fried banana split - delicious ! <sssss> if you try nothing else that 's not-so-good-for-you , make sure you try the banana split . <sssss> my goodness was it good ! <sssss> if you 've ever had puerto rican desserts with deep-fried bananas , imagine that with ice cream and sundae toppings ! <sssss> mmm ! <sssss> disclaimer ! <sssss> - for all of you reading this and thinking about how disgusting all that sounds , do yourself a favor and remember that it 's a fair and it 's all in good fun . <sssss> overall the fair was a good time . <sssss> the ride wristband is a must if you want to ride anything at all . <sssss> oh , and it 's definitely worth it to take a few minutes to look on the website before going . <sssss> there are a lot of different deals .
?		froyo has become quite the thing in the valley as of late and my favorite has always been mojo ! <sssss> never have i gone there and have gotten treated poorly , it 's always clean and the fresh fruit is always actually fresh ! <sssss> the only location around phoenix i have n't been to is the biltmore location but what i just said goes for every other one as well ! <sssss> now if decently priced and delicious froyo was n't enough , they have insanely priced froyo on tuesdays ! <sssss> all you have to do is keep an eye out for their secret word for half off your order ! <sssss> follow them @mojoyogurt -lrb- do n't forget to retweet -rrb- . <sssss> it 's also great for a cheap date if you feel like chatting in between bites ; i know my girlfriend and i have done it . <sssss> go drop by a mojo if you want a great treat that you do n't have to feel guilty about ! <sssss> i love it and have never been disappointed !
?		the first time i sank my teeth into haji baba 's falafel sandwich , i knew that i had found a winner . <sssss> already being a big fan of phoenecia , i was a little hesitant at first to try haji baba , but i had a feeling that i would like it so i gave it a shot . <sssss> there are three things that you absolutely have to try , and they are : the falafel sandwich . <sssss> the gyro plate . <sssss> the dolmas -lrb- stuffed grape leaves -rrb- . <sssss> like most of the reviews read , the falafels are some of the best around ! <sssss> they do n't dry out your mouth and are loaded with flavor ... not to mention that the sandwich is ultra cheap ! <sssss> as for the gyro plate , i have one thing to say ... best gyro meat in phoenix ! <sssss> there , i said it . <sssss> the meat is seriously succulent -lrb- you hear that about steak , not gyro meat ! <sssss> -rrb- , no exaggeration . <sssss> just think of the best gyro meat you 've ever tasted , but cut thick and served with some of the best tzatziki around . <sssss> remember to get the plate when you go and i do n't think you will regret it . <sssss> and lastly , try the dolmas . <sssss> i say that because they are served here differently than any place in the valley that i 've been to , and that is warm . <sssss> usually dolmas are served chilled and are brimming with strong sour and oily flavors , not these . <sssss> haji baba 's recipe is truly unique ; it 's mild , not sour and rich with flavor . <sssss> get a small side of lebne to put on em and be prepared for your taste buds to do a little happy dance -lrb- not to be confused with the pee pee dance ... taste buds do n't pee -rrb- . <sssss> there you have it ! <sssss> i finally , after years of going here , reviewed haji baba ! <sssss> now , take it from me and the abundance of other reviewers and go here .
?		just a quick update ! <sssss> this place is still awesome , and after going back and forth between the two , i feel that it is better than da vang -lrb- and should have won best of phoenix , dammit -rrb- . <sssss> i recently tried the banh mi ti and the vietnamese chicken curry and both were great . <sssss> for $ 2.25 the banh was big enough to hold me over -lrb- though not for long -rrb- for a quick and super cheap meal . <sssss> maybe a banh and some spring rolls would be a perfect combination ... the curry was freshly made and you can pick between rice , a bread roll and vermicelli noodles to accompany it . <sssss> chicken curry will be a nice alternative when i 'm not in the mood for pho , whic is something i already do at saigon nites in north scottsdale -lrb- a little shout out for them = -rrb- -rrb- . <sssss> i love pho thanh ! <sssss> i will be back soon !
?		i am so happy that i found this place ! <sssss> i 've always been into the deli scene , but had never heard of this place . <sssss> coincidentally , i had recently watched man vs. food and when harry met sally , both of which were filmed -lrb- at one point in time -rrb- at katz 's in nyc . <sssss> at this point something deep inside of me craved top-notch pastrami or corned beef . <sssss> the next thing i know i 'm browsing stores in a strip and come across scott 's . <sssss> i had a very tough time deciding but i went with the reuben ; not just any reuben though , but a combination with pastrami and corned beef . <sssss> i truly feel that i could not have made a better choice for my first visit because it was one epic reuben . <sssss> it was unbelievably rich and juicy . <sssss> the meats worked extremely well together , especially when accompanied by the russian dressing . <sssss> combined with fries , pickles and slaw , this was a meal fit for a jewish king -lrb- oh , and the server was great ; really relaxed and accommodating -rrb- ! <sssss> since reading reviews here on yelp , i 'll probably come visit again the next time i 'm awake on the weekend early enough for breakfast . <sssss> my first experience here was pretty astounding compared to most places ; i even got free bagels on the way out the door ! <sssss> go to this place and enjoy it !
?		as far as breakfast is concerned , this place deserves 5 stars ! <sssss> joe 's diner is a classic diner through and through . <sssss> the decor is made up of old gas station signage and shiny diner furniture ... it has a great feel to it . <sssss> i ordered the number 2 which is basically like a sampler -lrb- think denny 's grand slam -rrb- . <sssss> it had bacon , sausage , eggs and a couple of pancakes to round it all off . <sssss> it was everything i hoped it would be , the bacon was thick and cooked perfectly , and the pancakes , though not very fluffed up , had a perfect classic pancake flavor . <sssss> all of that for about what denny 's charges at $ 6 . <sssss> i also got to try some of a bacon and american cheese omelette , along with a homemade biscuit with chorizo sausage gravy ! <sssss> oh , yeah ... chorizo sausage gravy ! <sssss> if you like sausage gravy , give the chorizo gravy a try . <sssss> it is n't on the menu so make sure to ask for it specifically . <sssss> i 'm already anticipating the next time i can dine at joe 's . <sssss> i had a fantastic experience , and i really hope this place gets busy as hell ! <sssss> and , one last thing ... not only was the food and service more than i expected , but joe himself came to my table and shook my hand . <sssss> he 's a really cool guy that definitely takes a lot of pride in his diner .
?		pho-king phenomenal ! <sssss> i have to say it ... this place hosts the best pho i 've ever eaten . <sssss> i got the pho dac biet and tasted the pho ga. . <sssss> both were amazing -lrb- my favorite being the dac biet -rrb- . <sssss> the chef was not shy about how much of `` the fixins '' to add ! <sssss> the broth was stewed to near perfection and every bite spread happiness throughout my tum tum . <sssss> i also got to try the spring rolls . <sssss> they were spot on and were super fresh ! <sssss> i could not have asked for a better saturday lunch that day , and all for about $ 15 including the other soup that i paid for . <sssss> i highly , highly recommend eating here if you 're a pho enthusiast ! <sssss> it is absolutely my favorite pho spot in phoenix now and i plan on being a regular .
?		this place hit the spot ! <sssss> i 'm so glad i decided to check this little place out . <sssss> filipino food is hard to find when looking at restaurants out here , but now i can say i 've found one . <sssss> i wanted to try everything on the menu ! <sssss> i ended up getting the coconut chicken curry , adobo , chili and lumpia . <sssss> everything was amazing and tasted like it was cooked at home . <sssss> the chicken curry even had whole chicken wings in it -lrb- this made me so happy -rrb- ! <sssss> next time i go , i have to try an adobo burrito ! <sssss> the icing on the cake for me was that karen and rey were unbelievably friendly . <sssss> i felt like i was at a close friend 's house whose family was cooking and making me try all of the delicious food . <sssss> i ca n't wait to find time to go back to karey 's . <sssss> i plan to bring my filipino roommate -lrb- he smiled so wide when i told him there was good filipino food afoot -rrb- . <sssss> thank you very much karen and rey ! <sssss> see you soon !
?		this is the kind of place that breathes the central phoenix vibe . <sssss> the atmosphere is wonderful -lrb- and perfect for a date -rrb- . <sssss> it 's small , low-lit and extremely cozy . <sssss> when i say cozy , i mean cozy ; i had dinner on a love seat . <sssss> the music is at just the right level to hear people talk and totally suited the restaurant . <sssss> when i was there there were jazzy renditions of classic hip hop tracks playing ... just perfect . <sssss> now , in this great atmosphere that they 've created at tmi is a plethora of wonderful food and drinks . <sssss> the beer selection is stellar , not choosing to go with more traditional beers on tap and leaning towards craft brews . <sssss> that 's a huge plus in my book . <sssss> i love being drawn to a place because i know they have a unique beer on tap . <sssss> after sipping on some great beer came some great food . <sssss> i tried the cheese spread , the mac and cheese and the coronado coney . <sssss> all three were bursting with great flavors that i can honestly say were unique to this experience . <sssss> lots of places serve similar items , but tmi puts a little twist on each dish that makes it their own . <sssss> by the way , the waitress was extremely helpful and gave great recommendations . <sssss> needless to say , i will be back here sometime soon to discover and enjoy more of what tmi has to offer . <sssss> i hope this review might help those who are on the fence about trying this place . <sssss> it truly made my night when i got around to trying it .
?		it 's hard to write a review for a restaurant that is loved by so many others as an elite yelper , and have to give it a `` meh '' review . <sssss> cibo initially won me over with its great atmosphere , fantastic hosts and delicious appetizers , but it did not last . <sssss> be prepared for a lengthy review because i 'd really like to describe my experience in full . <sssss> i wound up at cibo with a decent-sized group -lrb- 12 total , i believe -rrb- , and everything started off great ; the drinks began flowing and the appetizer was being passed around for all to share . <sssss> the process for ordering was a little slow , but busy friday night , large table ... no biggie . <sssss> i completely understood , and we kept ourselves busy with conversation . <sssss> after a bit we got our entrée orders in and everyone went with pizzas , and not 10 minutes later , they began to arrive . <sssss> now , being the first visit for me , i decided to ask for recommendations . <sssss> that 's just what i like to do because i like to hear a server get really excited about one of their favorite dishes . <sssss> for the white pizzas , our server suggested the di notte . <sssss> i was instantly sold , so much so that i asked for a suggestion on the red pizzas . <sssss> he then mentioned the capricciosa , and after a brief chat between him , my girlfriend and myself -lrb- important note : about the artichokes on the pizza -rrb- , i told him that we 'd take it . <sssss> going back to the arrival of the pizzas ... they came out staggered , which made sense since there is only one pizza oven . <sssss> we all began sharing as each pie came out , and life was good . <sssss> first we got our di notte -lrb- a delicious mix of cheese and spicy salami -rrb- which was cooked perfectly and tasted great ! <sssss> a little later , after other pie orders began filling the table , came a vegetarian . <sssss> the runners are slammed , and they just call out the names of the pizzas and wait for a hand to be raised . <sssss> not really hearing the name correctly , i asked if that was the pizza with the artichokes . <sssss> the runner said yes , and i took the pizza -lrb- note : i was the only one at the table that had artichokes on my pizza -rrb- . <sssss> this all brings me to the most awkward moment at a restaurant for me in a very long time . <sssss> we decided to wait on touching the vegetarian pizza because we thought the runner just delivered to the wrong table . <sssss> it happens , and i was totally ready to hand that pie over unscathed . <sssss> but when our server came back and i mentioned the potential mistake , he told me that was what i ordered and continued to repeat it over and over . <sssss> this was an embarrassing situation mostly because i took his recommendation because it was my first visit , and we had never even mentioned the `` vegetariana , '' and because during the conversation we were having the whole table fell silent -lrb- funny little extra - the musician just started his break as well ... complete silence -rrb- . <sssss> he caused a scene even after i had told him it was alright and we 'd just take the pizza because it was a mistake . <sssss> i tried not to place any blame and talked to him with a `` this happens '' kind of demeanor , but he insisted that that 's what we ordered ... plus he said that he specifically remembered us ordering that because we were n't interested in artichokes . <sssss> guess what 's on the vegetariana , folks ? <sssss> yep . <sssss> artichokes . <sssss> a whole fourth of the pizza was covered in them -lrb- i love artichokes , by the way . <sssss> this posed no problem . <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> once that was pointed out , instead of any sort of apology , he decided to explain how the artichokes were only on one `` quadrant '' of the pizza . <sssss> c'mon now ... i can see a bullshitter , and that was just blatant . <sssss> it 's ridiculous to claim that we ordered a different pizza because of one particular ingredient only to order another with the same ingredient . <sssss> i hope you , the reader , is understanding the uncomfortable situation that i was in because it was a weird one . <sssss> i kind of could n't wait to get out of there for the remainder of the dinner . <sssss> that all being said , the woman at the cash bar , melissa , was great , and she really made an effort to make our table feel a little more comfortable after the whole incident . <sssss> i hope the owner of cibo can take note of that because it was n't really her job , but she was sweet , personable and took it upon herself to feel embarrassed and responsible for our server . <sssss> my first trip to cibo was a bust , and it 's really hard to want to make a return visit , but in time i 'm sure i will . <sssss> i ca n't let one bad experience dictate how i completely feel about such a beloved local restaurant . <sssss> sorry for the length , but i hope this review can be of help to someone . <sssss> the food and the atmosphere was good , but my experience with the service totally overshadowed them .
?		i 've been trying to get to el bravo for months , and i finally made it ! <sssss> the atmosphere is pretty cozy and the staff was very friendly . <sssss> i ordered a green chili burrito with beef and potatoes , and i also ordered a shredded pork taco . <sssss> the burrito was great . <sssss> the green chili was a winner in the flavor department . <sssss> on the contrary though , the shredded pork was pretty bland . <sssss> it almost tasted like it was n't spiced at all . <sssss> it was unfortunate , but it did n't ruin my visit . <sssss> lastly , i got to try some of a chicken burrito . <sssss> i am definitely ordering chicken during my next visit . <sssss> it was some of the best tasting chicken that i 've had at a mexican restaurant . <sssss> it was well seasoned and not dried out ! <sssss> i 've had so many bad experiences with chicken at mexican dives that i 've pretty much stopped ordering it , but el bravo will be my exception . <sssss> i 'm going to need to try more , but all in all , el bravo was pretty good .
?		a great new year event . <sssss> i enjoyed the drinks , outdoor environment , and the all you can eat food . <sssss> yes that 's right the kitchen staff brought out wings , chicken kabobs , and sliders . <sssss> plenty of grub to enjoy during the rooftop celebration of the new year . <sssss> i am glad they had plenty of heaters since it was in the 30/40 degree range , which is cold for the majority of us . <sssss> with the 3rd floor open roof , the heaters became gathering spots for me and other cold guests . <sssss> plenty of security and no rift raft was noted during the event . <sssss> the four of us had a good time . <sssss> plenty of people , friendly at that and i personally had enough liquor in one night . <sssss> the fake snow was an interesting part of the new year celebration . <sssss> the snow poured out as the new year began . <sssss> i also noted great music , dj was great with plenty of uplifting music . <sssss> created plenty of energy in the crowd of people . <sssss> if i were to decide on a place to go for 2014 it will be hard not to go back to the lustre bar for new years .
?		ate here with my family in tow and ... wow ! <sssss> get the fresh mozzarella . <sssss> i never had fresh mozzarella and i am glad i did . <sssss> if you are going here try the mozzarella please . <sssss> be prepared right off the cave creek exit in a strip mall , had to make a u turn to get into it . <sssss> also the windows are all blacked out so at first i was not sure it was open . <sssss> great place to have some pizza , everyone liked the pizza ... yes my kids are good judges of pizza . <sssss> when they get full on pizza and not ask about dessert you know its good : -rrb-
?		still find this to be my only local source for hard to find asian treats . <sssss> in fact this store was a `` bribe '' to have my daughter fully clean her room , closet , under the bed etc. . <sssss> an actual full cleaning so she could get her snacks from lee lees . <sssss> since i am half chinese , my daughter has grown to love the asian snacks and foods from here . <sssss> so if you are in the area for something different or ingredients for your korean , japanese , chinese , etc. dish make a stop here . <sssss> i do wish it had an on site bakery , would love fresh baked goods , but that would really make it a one stop shop for my cravings . <sssss> enjoy .
?		i am glad i do not live close to this donut shop . <sssss> with the 24 hour drive thru , excellent selection of donuts , boba drinks , and even shaved ice available all day it is a diet killer . <sssss> i stopped by late , about 10pm and they still had a large selection of donuts , i picked up a dozen to `` sample '' the flavors . <sssss> i enjoyed the old fashioned , boston creme , chocolate filled , raspberry filled , and some classic sugar laden regular donuts . <sssss> delicious and i was on a sugar high . <sssss> to add to my sugar high i added a boba thai coffee large . <sssss> pretty of boba to enjoy my long drive back to the west valley . <sssss> i really enjoyed the coffee and it is a rare treat by my home . <sssss> i am still craving another excuse to drive here and get another . <sssss> i also did sample some shaved ice in the unconventional rainbow fashion . <sssss> the staff was not use to serving a rainbow shaved ice , but were very accommodating . <sssss> he noted they usually only do one flavor , but attempted a 4 flavor ice sample . <sssss> it is still great to have shaved ice at 10pm when its 50 degrees outside right ? <sssss> i also noted breakfast croissants and other breakfast treats , bagels and creme cheese , etc. . <sssss> i could not really concentrate on that part of the menu , the donuts in the glass cases are mesmerizing . <sssss> i imagined sampling them all while i reduced my selection to only 12 donuts . <sssss> i can say that the 12 donuts did not last a day on the kitchen island and the donut box is now a empty box of memories . <sssss> i hope to visit bosa again and enjoy another dozen and maybe sample some other items they provide . <sssss> i hope you have the opportunity to sample bosa donuts as well .
?		i had the short ribs ... if you like short ribs this is a must try here ?? <sssss> yes at a bowling alley the short ribs was delicious and the parmesan bread pudding was an unexpected treat . <sssss> i finished this plate and for a fair price of $ 15 ! <sssss> not an avid bowler so i sat it out with my group and just had beer and food . <sssss> great place for a large crowd to mingle or in our case a birthday party . <sssss> great music , video screens , and watching drunk people bowl is great entertainment : -rrb-
?		gorgeous !!! <sssss> food - eh , its ok ... as weird as it is to say this . <sssss> . <sssss> try the brussels sprouts bar - tom the bartender makes this place worth going to all by himself . <sssss> hes over the top fun !! <sssss> good drinks fast ! <sssss> i have been here several times and even though i did n't care for i at first they seem to be improving all of the things that seem to be off . <sssss> now even offering a complementary hummus bar during happy hour -lrb- which was not previously offered -rrb-
?		went over of my my way to visit based on a suggestion from my little bro . <sssss> the scene - walking in it looked very friendly and clean a little stark bu nice and modern . <sssss> the music didnt make any sense in the place . <sssss> weird , felt like it didnt belong . <sssss> flovors - ok so yes they did have several flavors but was disappointed that there went really too many that i thought would mix well . <sssss> although they have aoatmeal cookie that was dead on to the real thing , i wasnt too impressed by the flavors which , didnt have anything unique . <sssss> top of the morning ' - the toppings were quite spectacular , mainly the sauces , frosting , mallow cream , nutella , all kinds of yummy toppings and my bestest nochi , i think thats it -lrb- little powdery mallows -rrb- counter lady - was helpful and nice , the oly thing she was explaining the way it works to a group in friont , but she controls the samples so we had to wait a bit and the people behind us even longer . <sssss> i must say while there wasnt custmers she was cleaning and arranging the toppings so it was very nice to see staff working , not just texdting behind the corner , looked like she had pride in her job . <sssss> break it down jess - i will return to yogurtology if in the area and in the mood , however having drove 10 miles just to try it , i wasnt super impressed but if you like the self servestyle , its a go !
?		i have been there several times over the last six months . <sssss> no real complaints but not realy any wows ! <sssss> either . <sssss> i enjoy the concept which is one of the main reasons we continue to go back . <sssss> the `` sliders '' idea is great especially in large groups . <sssss> i had the waygu , wild boar and caprese salad on the last visit . <sssss> the salad was standard so cant complain there . <sssss> the waygu was disappointing because i love waygu steak but for the price not bad . <sssss> the boar gave me as well my my friend stomach aches but we had never had it before so that may be why . <sssss> the white sangria is killer i think i had like four . <sssss> its a fun nice clean and contemporary place for a weekend lunch and can pretty much please any kind of eater .
?		simply the best ! <sssss> i was there for the yelp event but could have spent the night i just couldnt get enough . <sssss> there is so much to explore and learn ! <sssss> i enjoyed laying on the bed of nails , and moving the ball with my mind . <sssss> i have recommened this for people that live here and people from out of town on vacation . <sssss> staff is incredably fun and happy to help and assist you . <sssss> i just cant say enough but , ill simply say go !! <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> thats all i feel i can say wthout rambing about how amazing this place is .
?		i generally hate going to places that seem over hyped , so i was not really in the mood to drive 90 miles round trip to eat here . <sssss> their website boasts `` top 10 sushi spots in the united states '' by bon appetit . <sssss> fortunately , roka akor did not disappoint . <sssss> beautiful restaurant , a positive experience started at the front door as the hostess welcomed us and acted happy to see us even though it was our first time there . <sssss> she sat us at the bar at our request as we wanted to try out the happy hour menu . <sssss> we ordered the following . <sssss> sweet corn tempura $ 4 , excellent , hard to describe , just order it ! <sssss> kobe beef and kimchi dumplings $ 7.50 , excellent as well and not too spicy . <sssss> roast duck with kimchi udon $ 6 , great but really spicy butterfish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu $ 9 , small but full of flavor , delicious ! <sssss> also ordered a couple of standard sushi rolls that were good but unremarkable . <sssss> our server shana , was top notch which made our meal even more enjoyable . <sssss> overall meal including cocktails $ 110 plus tip . <sssss> oh , and do n't forget to check out the blocks of triple filtered glacier ice they use for specialty drinks that sit on the bar . <sssss> yes , i am easily entertained .
?		i had no idea this place existed . <sssss> i was minding my own business , while walking down main street in scottsdale with a few of my associates , when one of them mentioned that he needed a restroom . <sssss> well , just then some random passers by overheard and pointed us to go to mabels . <sssss> ok , so from the outside you would not know that this place is something special . <sssss> beautiful bar , friendly staff and what turned out to be some good food . <sssss> if only i did not live 90 minutes away , mable 's would be be a regular hangout . <sssss> try the swedish meatballs , at 4 dollars you will be happy !
?		we stopped by kona grill today for lunch mostly because we were in the area and wanted somewhere to sit and have a bite . <sssss> the restaurant is comfortable and beautiful . <sssss> we got there just after they opened so there were not a lot of customers but i suspect it was because we were there so early . <sssss> the menu has changed since the last time i ate there so it took me a while to go through the menu . <sssss> along with their regular menu , for lunch they offer 15 items and you can choose two for $ 8 . <sssss> i selected the miso soup and the sushi combo consisting of shrimp , tuna and salmon sushi . <sssss> if you are not into sushi , also on the choose two menu is an assortment of salads soups and sandwiches . <sssss> our server was excellent and was attentive .
?		huge portions , great service , clean , confortable surroundings all welcomed me today to the ranch house grille . <sssss> i ordered the chicken fried steak with homemade pork chili verde $ 10 . <sssss> normally i would never in a million years order this , as i have stopped ordering chicken fried steak years ago because nobody makes it right . <sssss> after being talked into trying it , it arrived on my table and omg , it is the best ! <sssss> tender , crispy steak with a perfect chili verde . <sssss> the breakfast also came with 2 eggs and a huge portion of hash browns . <sssss> definately recomended .
?		after watching `` the best thing i ever ate '' episode that featured del piero , at the olive mill i could not wait to try this place out . <sssss> i had been to the olive mill before but never took advantage of the restaurant until today . <sssss> definitely a great little place that specializes in olive oil and other olive related products that are produced from pesticide free hand harvested arizona olives . <sssss> set in the middle of their retail shop is a walk up counter where you order off the menu . <sssss> we all chose their kalamata sandwich , `` pork shop '' italian and kalamata salami , capicola , herb roasted tomatoes , leafy greens , provolone , red onion and white balsamic & herb crema on a grilled baguette . <sssss> the sandwich also came with potato chips and a sample of olives . <sssss> -lrb- watch out for the pits -rrb- next time i will ask for some extra the white balsamic & herb crema , on the side , it was that good !
?		not sure how i have missed this place as i live 5 minutes away but stopped in today for the first time for lunch . <sssss> the restaurant is very clean and like many others have said it is cafeteria style . <sssss> you step up to the counter and they prepare you food to order . <sssss> they have a great number of different sandwiches , salads , soups and deserts to choose from . <sssss> i ordered the `` new yorker '' piled high with hot pastrami topped with homemade cole slaw and miracle mile dressing $ 9.79 . <sssss> sandwiches come with your choice of sides and a pickle . <sssss> i can not remember ever having better pastrami . <sssss> service was friendly as expected . <sssss> i will probably go back tomorrow . <sssss> : - -rrb-
?		i am so mad that i have not gone to this place before ! <sssss> the tortas are amazing and i do not have a single bad thing to say about them . <sssss> this will absolutely be one of my regular places to eat . <sssss> if you have not gone yet , you should !!
?		delicious !
?		my wife and i just moved into the area and we felt like eating mexican food . <sssss> we came across bajios and decided to try it out . <sssss> it was definitely comparable to chipotle while still being different and it was very good . <sssss> i would actually even say that they have more to chose from than chipotle . <sssss> will definitely be going back soon !
?		the best pizza in the great state of arizona ! <sssss> enough said
?		i love this place ! <sssss> they have great sales on super fabulous awesome steaks ! <sssss> i bought some ribeyes that were seriously much better than aj 's and 75 % less ! <sssss> the chicken is organic and seriously it does taste better ... and it was super reasonable as well . <sssss> the market has great vegies and odd stuff that is difficult to find other places . <sssss> the help is really helpful and friendly . <sssss> all in all it 's a great experience !
?		humble pie really should n't be humble any more ... this place is awesome now ! <sssss> house made burrata ... house made mozzerella ... fabulous meatballs , tasty sauce on the pizzas , wild mushroom mix ... the pizza , caprese are both amazing ... great service and speedy for take out . <sssss> we tried the wings and they are so so ... but everything else was extraordinary . <sssss> do n't hesitate this place has been remarkable the 3 times i have visited recently !
?		we really wanted some indian food ... so we went to jewel of the crown for take out . <sssss> it was saturday night and there were about 20 people dining so we felt like at lease some people were eating there . <sssss> we ordered shish kabob ... it ended up being dried up and spiced oddly ... we could not stomach eating it . <sssss> the vegie korma was ok but had huge ... not bite size vegies in it . <sssss> like really large carrot pieces and like whole quarters of potato . <sssss> the chicken tiki masala was pretty good the chicken was tender and the sauce was pretty nice . <sssss> the rice and nan were fine . <sssss> i guess we were expecting something really great and it was so so ... next time we will try a different place until we find an indian place that is better : -lrb-
?		high tea ... this is one of the best in the valley ! <sssss> the beautiful environment , piano playing , and exquisite service is topped by no other place . <sssss> the chairs are so comfortable and the china so fine . <sssss> we started with high quality darjeling tea followed by an array of tea sandwiches including egg salad , cucumber cream cheese , smoked salmon and a few others . <sssss> you can eat as many as you want ! <sssss> the next course was two scones a plain and a cranberry served with delightful lemon curd , fresh strawberry jam and my favorite clotted cream that was whipped ! <sssss> the last course is the desserts . <sssss> mini chocolate cake , raspberry cake , lemon dessert , chocolate covered strawberries and shortbread ! <sssss> it 's a nice place for a birthday they sing and make a big deal with extra dessert ... we left full and pleased !
?		i have to say , this one is not a good sushi at all . <sssss> this one is one of the worst sushi ever . <sssss> costco sushi even taste better than this . <sssss> i 'm sorry , i know that this place just open a week ago , but . <sssss> . <sssss> i ca n't say anything positive about the food . <sssss> the place used to be a fastfood restaurant -lrb- hawaian bbq -rrb- that is being converted into sushi join . <sssss> but with no sushi bar -lrb- surprise -rrb- . <sssss> yes the place have a great service , friendly and bright . <sssss> but i 'm only rate based on quality of the food . <sssss> yes i 'm in phoenix , but still , there are some other decent place to eat . <sssss> unless they fix on how they prepare the sushi . <sssss> they 'll not get any repeat customer . <sssss> yes they gave me free ice-cream and other sashimi .
?		one of the best hyatt in phoenix . <sssss> the nice thing about this place is that the pool is all in one area , so you do n't have to run around to look for someone . <sssss> yea , its not as great as other resort -lrb- hilton has a nicer pool area -rrb- but if you can get a suite , its not a bad spot for a weekend vacation . <sssss> the regency club is nice . <sssss> have a great selection of snack -lrb- breakfast , and deserts -rrb-
?		at first i was skeptical about the place . <sssss> but will give it a try anyway . <sssss> it took forever for our food to come in , because we did n't order the lunch special but order a tons of authentic food . <sssss> 2 appetizer and 2 main dishes . <sssss> unfortunately i ca n't pronounce or remember the name of the items we ordered . <sssss> but the food was amazing . <sssss> you have to ask for their special salsa . <sssss> awesome . <sssss> i asked for 2nd , and they say . <sssss> well . <sssss> we sell these and do n't give out to customer . <sssss> lol . <sssss> anyway , the sour fish was ok . <sssss> but the tamales is not your average mexican tamales . <sssss> and do n't call their food mexican food . <sssss> because they are not . <sssss> what we ordered was colombian food and they were goood . <sssss> and the purple drink was good as well .
?		raising cane 's is has taken phoenix by storm with its new locations . <sssss> they build from the ground up , so all their locations look the same and thus are brand new and super clean . <sssss> the food was fair , i was hoping for more of a chik-fil-a style nugget or stripe , but instead got large strips that were pretty heavy with greasy fried coating . <sssss> the price was also high for a fast food value meal . <sssss> i would drive the extra few miles to hit up a chik-fil-a vs. going to the cane 's that is closer to my house , but its worth a try just to check out this new chain the valley of the sun .
?		i grew up going to fajitas about twice a month and am still a big fan . <sssss> the food and service are amazing . <sssss> there is no reason to get anything but fajitas at this spot . <sssss> we love the chicken and the cadillac beef the best . <sssss> they tortillas are amazing . <sssss> . <sssss> they make them right there and are the best in town . <sssss> the service is always great and this is a good spot for large groups as well . <sssss> the only reason i gave them 4 stars vs 5 stars is because they need to update the dining room and restrooms . <sssss> the place is always clean , but the restrooms are in real need of a major renovation .
?		we had a group of 14 and the service and food were amazing . <sssss> it 's hard to find both with a party that large , but wally 's scored the highest markets . <sssss> not one person in our party did not love the food - from the burgers and mac and cheese to the pot roast and fish and chips everyone gave wally 's a 5 star review . <sssss> the staff was friendly and had our table waiting upon arrival . <sssss> the waters were already set on the table and the drink orders came out quickly and correct . <sssss> the food for the group was out within 15 minutes of ordering and again it was all so tasty . <sssss> its great `` pub '' food and we will be back !
?		if you are a tourist , this is not `` authentic '' az mexican food , but will hit the spot . <sssss> we usually get the lunch flauta plate . <sssss> good deal for a-ok eats .
?		we live in artisan village so we can literally walk out our door and be at this location in about 30 steps . <sssss> it is a great addition to the neighborhood and the only shop along the way that has actually stayed in business . <sssss> the staff is usually pretty friendly and the food good . <sssss> the breakfast sandwiches are really tasty and you can build your own . <sssss> the chicken monacco sandwich is also very good and unique . <sssss> i have not had one like it anywhere else . <sssss> the baked good are the highlight and do n't disappoint . <sssss> the crack cake is as good as it sounds and the brownie is loaded with tasty frosting . <sssss> they are a bit pricey but a great splurge treat .
?		this was ballpark number one on the spring training tour of 2008 . <sssss> my first ever . <sssss> being a 's fans , and this is their park , we had to make it the first stop . <sssss> we got in around 12pm for the 1pm game and ventured on down to the bottom of the stands at nearly field level . <sssss> boy , talk about up close and personal with the players . <sssss> this is great . <sssss> i even got my first ever autograph from a baseball player , thanks lenny dinardo . <sssss> we actually got to see two games here and sat in two different areas . <sssss> the stadium is very homey . <sssss> small . <sssss> no grass to sit on out in the outfield areas . <sssss> no fancy booths selling local vendor foods . <sssss> just a cute little park with real seats at in every section . <sssss> all the seats are good . <sssss> there are two beer gardens with benches for picnics up and set back from the sets . <sssss> lots of vendors selling only the basic ballpark fares and a few gift shops so buy all the great spring training garb . <sssss> of course i will come here again , its the a 's park !!! <sssss> but , it would be great to see them play against other teams some of the other parks .
?		the other half and i did some poor planning one night of our spring training . <sssss> we did not pre-buy tickets to a game against the az diamond backs . <sssss> wooops . <sssss> we got all the way over to the stadium to find a huge line of cars to park , no parking spaces , and a sold out game . <sssss> ugh . <sssss> so , we turned around and headed back to scottsdale to get some food . <sssss> i remembered this place on my `` to eat '' list from yelp . <sssss> we found it on the blackberry and off we went . <sssss> it was not very crowded . <sssss> we were seated right away . <sssss> our seater and server were very nice . <sssss> the server made recommendations , one being the soup choice . <sssss> it was not a super hot day , so we were opting for soup and he said the presentation of this one particular soup was very good ... flames . <sssss> i believe it was chicken wonton soup . <sssss> we also ordered the drunken dragon noodles and a vegetable dish -lrb- that i just can not remember right now . <sssss> -rrb- the waiter was correct , the presentation of the soup was great . <sssss> i even took pictures , as hard as it is to get flames on film . <sssss> the plates were all average sized , but plenty for the two of us . <sssss> the food was all quite good , though a bit on the pricier side for thai . <sssss> overall , i think an excellent selection for the evening . <sssss> good relaxed , nice place with good staff , good food and even a baseball player sighting -lrb- though we have no idea who he was , probably a minor leaguer -rrb- .
?		after eating here i noticed many more oregano 's around town , making it a local chain . <sssss> but that does not change my review in the slightest . <sssss> after a grewling double header -lrb- both wins -rrb- , the baseball team opted for a late lunch , early dinner here on the way back to the resort . <sssss> we had a large group , so it took a few minutes -lrb- hanging out in the bar and the boys ordering drinks there -rrb- before they were able to make spots for us to sit near each other . <sssss> we were able to get two big booths in the back room . <sssss> -lrb- sadly , this room had no cable , so the all we got was some black and white movie rather than the football game ... though it did n't bother me much -rrb- . <sssss> each table had separate servers , since each had 7 people . <sssss> our servers were terrific . <sssss> they were very attentive and brought us pitchers of water so we never ran out . <sssss> we had ny style pizzas , lots of drinks , appetizers , and i am sure were just plain loud and roudy through all of it . <sssss> but , they tolerated us , treated us well and even chimed in the fun . <sssss> the pizza was great . <sssss> our table had the bbq chicken and an everything pizza combo . <sssss> i loved the bbq , but am just not a combo fan . <sssss> everything was delicious and everyone was quite satisfied . <sssss> the large pizzas are humongous and two seemed plenty for 7 of us -lrb- and that left even 6 pieces to take home . <sssss> -rrb- for appetizers , they ordered the cheesey garlic bread and the wings . <sssss> all were good . <sssss> this place is fun and lively and has a really great patio . <sssss> i would have loved to have sat out there . <sssss> the warm fall weather would have been perfect for it . <sssss> i would definitely eat here again . <sssss> they have other stuff too , if you do n't do pizza .
?		since i am so anti dives and pubs , this place is a good middle ground for me and my guy friends . <sssss> it 's a great place for happy hour - i love the nice ambiance and cleanliness , they love the huge beer list . <sssss> and since it 's right at chandler mall , i love that we can grab a drink , and i can hit up the sales . <sssss> perfect !
?		we stopped into claim jumper for a bite before our movie at harkins . <sssss> i 'd been there once before , years ago , and all i could remember were the portions that were the size of my face . <sssss> this time , we sat in the bar -lrb- a plus , since i 'll do just about anything to avoid sitting near a family with a screaming 3 year old -rrb- and it was great . <sssss> the service was very slow -lrb- knocking a star for that - albeit , it was very busy that night -rrb- , but otherwise , the food was great , nice and tasty . <sssss> they have a great happy hour menu with some killer deals on apps , and my favorite part is the decor . <sssss> the husband is very into rustic , and i like contemporary , and i think claim jumper hits right in the middle - almost like having dinner at my upscale cabin in flagstaff .
?		i 'm giving this place one more star than i normally would because i feel like i 'm reviewing it for husband and i. i like spinato 's pretty okay . <sssss> husband ? <sssss> yeah , he freaking loves spinato 's . <sssss> the pizza is nice and thin crust , and while the last time i was there it was being renovated , the decor is nice and casual . <sssss> we usually get take out , and the pizza is just as good the next day . <sssss> what makes spinato 's unique , is the pizza sauce . <sssss> it 's really sweet - and not `` your teeth will fall out '' sweet , but there 's a slight sweetness that adds another dimension to the pie . <sssss> it 's definitely worth a trip !
?		this place is a total hidden gem . <sssss> the food is fantastic , and it 's so cozy and intimate -- perfect for date night . <sssss> the decor is beautiful , nice and dark with a big brick oven . <sssss> the best thing on the menu is the prosciutto pizza - if you 're into prosciutto , you 're going to die over this pizza . <sssss> thin crust and perfect !
?		simple !!!!!!!!! <sssss> just plain great . <sssss> do go with the mexican hot chocolate !!!!!!
?		very nice place , great location for sure . <sssss> walking distances from all the life of scottsdale . <sssss> definitely a place to be seen . <sssss> could n't tell who was checking themselves out more , the dudes or the chicks . <sssss> the pool had so much silicon floating in it , the water was toxic . <sssss> definitely scottsdale $ 35,000 millionaire club hangout .
?		omg the blue cheese/honey !!!!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> so damn good . <sssss> while we usually go to wholefoods for our filling of s.r. we went up to scottsdale to hit the store . <sssss> thing the ice cream is a little different at the store then at wholefoods . <sssss> must be the temp and freshness . <sssss> i recommend this ice cream to anyone that love to try new funky lovers . <sssss> is say its on par with double rainbow from san francisco
?		we decided to have an early dinner -lrb- 5:00 pm -rrb- and since we have n't been to this place for some time ... here we are . <sssss> found parking in front of the restaurant and we ate out side 'cause there was hardly any wind and there were lots of places to sit . <sssss> i had the cuban sandwich with caesar salad and my wife had the skinnylicious chicken salad . <sssss> i had my first cuban sandwich at the miami int ' l airport and it does n't compare to the one i had here ; maybe because it was at an airport . <sssss> this one had lots of pork and ham and was darn good too . <sssss> i did n't think i could finish it , but i dug down deep and it was gone . <sssss> we ended up taking a home a slice of adam 's peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake to split between us . <sssss> all their food is great . <sssss> service was exceptional . <sssss> we 'll be back .
?		this was our first and last time . <sssss> why is there an entry charge of $ 12/person ??? <sssss> we got our tickets on groupon for $ 6/person . <sssss> and why would we pay $ 2 for an extrahand cardboard box . <sssss> you ca n't even sample other food trucks , it 's just too darn expensive . <sssss> we picked two foodtrucks , cost $ 30 . <sssss> add that to the entry fee and you can go to a sit down restaurant with no waiting line and clean bathrooms .
?		our daughter gave us a gift card for houston 's , but found out we could use it at bandera 's . <sssss> we made reservations for 5:30 . <sssss> do n't even mess around to find parking . <sssss> i guess i do n't have the ` parking karma ' yet . <sssss> tried looking for a space for 10 minutes and found valet parking kitty korner to the restaurant . <sssss> when we got there , the hostess was pleasant and we were immediately seated . <sssss> our server was polite and knowledgeable . <sssss> we started off with the mac & cheese . <sssss> wow , love the larger pasta and with the walnut cornbread crumbles it was delicious . <sssss> i ordered the snake river farms american style kobe tri tip and ceasar salad . <sssss> i forgot to tell the server that i wanted it medium rare . <sssss> when i got it , it was not over cooked and the flavors just exploded . <sssss> the caesar salad had too much dressing for me . <sssss> i should have had it on the side . <sssss> the croutons were made from the cornbread , different , but it worked . <sssss> my wife had the kobe-style steak and enchilada platter with escabeche . <sssss> she was blown away by the sauce on the enchilada and the flavors of the escabeche . <sssss> she ordered a side of escabeche to go , that 's how good it was . <sssss> by the way , we had an intruder flying around our booth for the first 10 minutes . <sssss> i hoping it died and did n't pester anyone else . <sssss> we finished off our meal with banana cream pie with caramel and crushed chocolate . <sssss> i did n't really need to order it , but i had n't had one for some time . <sssss> it was excellent . <sssss> now this is a place to bring your friends from out of town that you want to impress .
?		one of our favorite mexican restaurants . <sssss> my wife had a craving for mexican food , so we stopped off here for dinner . <sssss> we 've know about this place prior to moving to az in 1998 . <sssss> the food is delicious . <sssss> i keep forgetting to write a review and i started this one in november , 2011 . <sssss> i must have the comings of alzheimer . <sssss> anyway , this place used to be packed before rancho de tia rosa opened . <sssss> now the customers are starting to frequent this place more because the last time we were there , both dining areas where 85 % occupied .
?		before heading out to the arizona auto show , my wife and i decided to have lunch here . <sssss> the place was packed , had to wait about 10 minutes . <sssss> we ordered our sandwiches : wife had half egg salad sandwich with lettuce and sprouts ; i had the half-sandwich combo with chicken noodle soup . <sssss> my sandwich was pastrami on marble rye and no cheese . <sssss> the soup was delicious with lots of chicken , noodles and vegetables . <sssss> it was n't had hot as i would like it , but it was good . <sssss> the waitress brought out a whole egg salad sandwich and when i got mine , it was a whole sandwich with toasted rye , melted cheese with sauerkraut . <sssss> we both sent our sandwiches back and my wife 's came back the way she ordered it and the pastrami sandwich was on rye with cheese . <sssss> i was n't going to send it back a second time . <sssss> at the end of our meal , we ordered bagel chips , apparently they were all sold out . <sssss> but our waitress managed to get some from the pantry and did n't charge us . <sssss> the meal was satisfying with pastrami about two inches high . <sssss> i would have given this a 4 star , but not getting our order right the first time , i had to take a star away .
?		was going to another restaurant in tempe , but because of the ua vs asu game we changed restaurants . <sssss> we 've eaten here before , but have n't rated it since i joined yelp . <sssss> katie was our waitress and she must have come from the south because when she checked on my wife , she always ended her sentence with `` darlin ' '' . <sssss> katie mentioned her name twice , had good command of the menu and was very attentive . <sssss> my wife ordered the white clam chowder and crab cakes . <sssss> the clam chowder could have been hotter ; the crab cakes where light and cooked nicely . <sssss> i had the wild hawaiian ono which was grilled with sides of baked potato and roasted ratatouille which i thought was better than the garden vegetables . <sssss> it had squash , zuchini , tomatos and onions . <sssss> the fish was okay and a little dry . <sssss> the baked potato only came with sour cream and chives .
?		disappointment ! <sssss> i have been a huge fan and loyal patron of pei wei since they came to the valley . <sssss> we do n't go as much as we used to , but a few weeks ago we ordered take-out . <sssss> i asked if they would include both a mild and a hot sauce for the lettuce wraps and i customized a kids meal . <sssss> when dave brought our food home the first thing we noticed was 2 fortune cookies for three meals . <sssss> ok , maybe i should n't complain ... but come on ! <sssss> then the kids meal had barely any meat , another disappointment . <sssss> first , i dove into the lettuce wraps , which they only provided one sauce - not the two they said they would provide . <sssss> however ; the worst part was my meal , i had the mongolian beef ... a dish i usually crave from them , but my meal was so salty i could n't even eat it ! <sssss> it was absolutely horrible ! <sssss> again , very little meat in the dish . <sssss> sorry , but i think you lost a customer over this meal !
?		we have been here twice , and i am not very impressed with the service . <sssss> i 'm definitely over the skinny girls dressed like floozies ; it seems to be like that in every bar now ; if you are sexy naked , you are sexy dressed . <sssss> the first time we came here was a sunday morning waiting for a biker run . <sssss> the service was good , the burger was good . <sssss> they were slow , so i did n't have much to complain about . <sssss> the other night we went here for wings and beer . <sssss> i had to ask to have the bar cleaned . <sssss> it was about 9:30 pm and they had a crowd , but they were n't overly busy . <sssss> we had to ask for menus . <sssss> i ordered a beer and it seemed really large , but i went with it . <sssss> we ordered wings and a sandwich . <sssss> they were ok , nothing i could n't live without again . <sssss> the wings did have more meat on them then some of the other places i have been . <sssss> next , i had to ask for another beer , and i had to ask if there was a smaller size . <sssss> the small is really small . <sssss> dave never even got another drink because she never asked , and he did want one . <sssss> the one positive note i will say - i could n't decide what to drink , so she gave me a sample of a couple of beers and then suggested something based on the feedback i had on the beer samples . <sssss> one extra star for that suggestion , and attention . <sssss> we probably would have had a better experience if our server was more attentive and we would have spent more money on booze - but we just ate and left . <sssss> not sure if we will go back again or not .
?		we had breakfast here a few weeks ago and i thoroughly enjoyed it . <sssss> at first i did n't care for the ordering process ; however after experiencing the service and meal , i was very pleased . <sssss> i liked the decor and ambiance . <sssss> we sat on the patio-which really sets this place above other restaurants , however that type of space/set-up is hard to come by in phoenix . <sssss> being dog-friendly was another plus . <sssss> there were several things i wanted to try , but i opted for the gouda and bacon brizza and dave had the santa fe eggs benedict . <sssss> of course i had coffee - and it was delicious ! <sssss> the brizza was very big , i ate just 1/2 -lrb- at it stuck with me all day -rrb- . <sssss> i felt the cheese/bacon proportions were perfect and flavorful . <sssss> i sampled the eggs benedict - also delicious ! <sssss> i felt the prices were good and the menu selection was well balanced . <sssss> obviously i am not a vegetarian ; however i respect their large vegetarian menu and their practice of separating the cooking areas and dishes - definitely not an easy task on their part - so that is very cool . <sssss> i ca n't wait to try some other dishes !
?		i 've been here three times and have had terrific food each time . <sssss> the meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing . <sssss> portion sizes are generous and the mac & cheese is delicious ! <sssss> this is what bbq is all about , definitely one of the best in phoenix and we 're lucky to have it here in the nw valley !
?		the princess and i have been huge fans of flo 's for years , since the original flo 's next to osco on tppw before they moved across the street . <sssss> this location is our local favorite and try to get over from the nw valley at least once a month . <sssss> the saturday $ 5 lunch special is truly the best lunch value in the value . <sssss> i really admire her business acumen for recognizing the need to pack her place during the economic downturn , provide excellent jobs , and still make good money on volume rather than gm % , but i digress . <sssss> if the food was n't good , it still would n't be worth $ 5 and it is . <sssss> we love the food and especially the generous discounts during happy hour . <sssss> my favorite on the menu is the house chow mein with shrimp , chicken , and beef-extra spice . <sssss> it is one of my all-time favorite things to eat . <sssss> the princess always gets the spicy ginger beef , kind of a play on mongolian beef , it 's excellent as well . <sssss> make sure you get the salad with their amazing , one of a kind ginger dressing , you 'll want to take some home -lrb- and yes they will sell you a container of it -rrb- . <sssss> hat 's off to flo 's ! <sssss> fantastic food and excellent service ! <sssss> well done !
?		been here four times and have never had a bad meal or experience . <sssss> the food is delicious and the portions are generouse , service has always been perfect , and the restaurant itself is beautiful . <sssss> i 've had maytag burger -lrb- blue cheese -rrb- served with spaghetti squash , wow , -lrb- i 'm not even the biggest burger fan -rrb- it was incredible . <sssss> had the grilled chicken salad for lunch one day and ate the whole , huge thing , could n't get enough of it . <sssss> highly recommend wcg !
?		i have a love/hate relationship with tee pee . <sssss> i love their chicken enchiladas , rice , beans and salsa . <sssss> the chicken fajita soft taco 's that jd gets always look good too . <sssss> but once i was seriously disappointed by the balloon-boy looking chile relleno thing . <sssss> last night we went expecting gooey cheesy goodness and a couple of margs and one of us left with a toothache . <sssss> on a whim , jd ordered a mexican pizza with fajita chicken instead of ground beef . <sssss> it came and looked so good i had to taste it . <sssss> it tasted good too . <sssss> i was impressed and things were looking great until ccc-rack ! <sssss> the pizza had some unexpected metal in it . <sssss> we told our server who later explained to us that the slicer used to cut the pizza had broken and left behind the rivet that jd tried to eat -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- that just seemed odd to us , and we both left with a bad taste in our mouths . <sssss> the pizza was n't on the bill , but it is definitely still on our minds .
?		i came here for a pre-thanksgiving dinner with the almost in laws . <sssss> we enjoyed happy hour drinks and appetizers on the patio to start , and what a great start it was ! <sssss> we munched on tater tot-like pom fritos and the sausage plate , which came with assorted pickles , mustard and pretzel bread . <sssss> next we moved into the dining room and our table of choice was next to the fireplace . <sssss> so cozy ! <sssss> we were all starving so we ordered another appetizer , the shrimp pepper pot . <sssss> that definitely did n't disappoint ! <sssss> the shrimp was incredible ! <sssss> it reminded us of the mo rockin shrimp from eddies house . <sssss> delish ! <sssss> for dinner i tried the pork tenderloin and absolutely loved it ! <sssss> it was perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor . <sssss> my man had chicken enchiladas and those were nice as well . <sssss> all in all , we were more than satisfied with our evening at el chorro , and will make it a point to return for happy hour and dinner more often !
?		i 've wanted to come here for awhile , and decided to do it for my birthday . <sssss> for a wednesday night it was packed , but we seemed to have gotten the last available table-woohoo ! <sssss> i did n't bother with the guac since the majority of the reviews do n't really tout it , and chose to start with the langosta tacos appetizer . <sssss> they were my favorite part of the meal ! <sssss> so good i could have eaten all four and ordered more , but instead i chose an entree . <sssss> i had the poblano chicken and jd ordered the chile relleno . <sssss> neither of us were really crazy about either dish . <sssss> both were on the bland side and my chicken was totally overcooked . <sssss> we kind of swapped food and i liked his more than mine just because it had scrumptious zucchini ! <sssss> all in all , we were n't really impressed except for the taco app . <sssss> the service was so-so , not terribly friendly or outgoing and the entrees were n't memorable or delicious -lrb- or worth what they cost in my opinion -rrb- i 'll probably not return , there are other places that serve better food at better prices and with much better service .
?		out shopping yesterday i was tired , hungry and sniffily -lrb- sp ? <sssss> -rrb- so i decided some changs lettuce wraps and wonton soup were in order for lunch . <sssss> the first time i called it sounded like somebody hung up . <sssss> i 've cut people off too so no big deal . <sssss> called back and sat on hold for what felt like forever until a surly sounding guy took my order and told me 15 minutes . <sssss> i go there expecting it to be busy and that was why the guy was crabby but it was probably only 1/3 full . <sssss> i walk in and there is nobody up front , so i go to the bar and wait and 5 minutes-no bartender . <sssss> i go back up front and find and ask the host about the bartender and she says he 'll be back soon so i continue to wait at the bar , no bartender no nobody . <sssss> finally the guy comes back and asks me `` you have the soup right ? '' <sssss> yeah i did . <sssss> i reluctantly tipped him a couple bucks and headed home only to find super salty lettuce wrap filling - like buckets of salt on it - and sub-par soup . <sssss> i just had this soup less than a week ago from the changs at kierland and it was awesome . <sssss> this one had a few scrawny looking shrimp in it where it usually comes with big juicy thick shrimp . <sssss> and something was off with the broth too , didnt taste right at all . <sssss> i have loved this soup for years and this was the first time i have been disappointed . <sssss> oh well , i will just avoid this location in the future !
?		had lunch with the fam here and we were all super pleased with most everything ! <sssss> we had a seaweed salad , vegas roll -lrb- * best ! <sssss> -rrb- , spicy tuna roll and split two lunch specials . <sssss> ma got pork katsu bento box and it finally came out as sis and i were finishing the bowl that i had ordered full of raw fish . <sssss> we were a bit scared at first , but the shrimp , tuna , yellowtail and salmon were in perfect bite sized pieces over rice and accompanied by tasty vegetables . <sssss> it was a winner even to sis who claims to hate salmon . <sssss> the pork was a letdown , but saved by the salad 's it was served over and next to . <sssss> ixnay the pork and everything was perfecto !
?		i swung by after a last chance session and picked up takeout . <sssss> it was super duper fast and quite inexpensive . <sssss> i couldnt wait to tear into the goods when i got home . <sssss> when i did , i was unimpressed . <sssss> the lunch special kung pao chicken was filled with gross dark meat chicken `` parts '' that i did n't even feed to my dog . <sssss> the shrimp fried rice was overly salty , oddly colored , and not very tasty . <sssss> i am still on the hunt for a good chinese place here in phx . <sssss> this definitely was n't it .
?		my man and i went to padre 's for dins and i had a groupon . <sssss> i showed it to the guy who seated us who i assumed to be the manager -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- and he made a comment that sounded to the two of us like `` great -lrb- not thrilled -rrb- , another groupon -lrb- smirk -rrb- '' . <sssss> this started us discussing why they would even offer a groupon if they were n't thrilled about people using them !?!? <sssss> whatevs - chico was our server and i really liked him . <sssss> we ordered chips and salsa and a lobster quesadilla to start since i had $ 50 to spend ! <sssss> cns ? <sssss> fine , not amazing , not bad . <sssss> lobster ` dilla - weird . <sssss> i did n't really like the mango-lobster combo and i found a couple pieces of shell which felt really great on my chompers . <sssss> for dinner i had the stuffed chicken `` house specialty '' and jd got the salmon spinach enchilada 's . <sssss> mine was good , not great and a little bit tough but nothing like jd 's . <sssss> i am a salmon lover through and through but once that enchilada entered my mouth i wanted it out asap . <sssss> blech ! <sssss> boo ! <sssss> yick ! <sssss> i actually wiped my tongue with my napkin -lrb- so ladylike , i know -rrb- . <sssss> it really was repulsive . <sssss> he ate most of it though , but did n't feel so good later . <sssss> i do n't think it was spoiled or anything - just reallly fishy in a bad bad way . <sssss> so a couple of things left a bad tasted in my mouth -lrb- literally and figuratively -rrb- . <sssss> but i ca n't say enough good things about chico . <sssss> he made the experience good just by being a nice guy and a stealth server . <sssss> the jury is out on whether i 'd go back . <sssss> i 'm always in that area but not much impressed me food-wise . <sssss> might be fun to drink and hang out though .
?		i had to pick up my car after it had some minor cosmetic surgery at scott 's coach works and decided to stay in the area for awhile . <sssss> after browsing around last chance awhile i decided to grab some lunch before heading home . <sssss> although their premade pizza 's looked pretty good , i decided on the lunch size louie prima calzone . <sssss> the wait would be about 20 minutes , so i went next door to fry 's for some quick grocery shopping . <sssss> i picked up my lunch and it just about killed me to smell it but not inhale it on the way home . <sssss> as i finally sat down to eat it i was like a kid at christmas ! <sssss> every time i tore into the perfectly browned crust i found another treasure . <sssss> sliced tomatos , gobs of spinich and a load of my absolute favorite-ricotta cheese all mixed up with a fair share of mozzarella too ! <sssss> and of course the marinara sauce for dipping . <sssss> it was pretty messy to eat , but anything i eat usually ends up being messy and in my book : messy = good . <sssss> i 'm a fan !
?		i was really impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the selection of proteins and veggies ! <sssss> the part that did n't work so well ? <sssss> the sauces . <sssss> many were hard to get to and even harder to dip due to the height of the containers and the sneeze proof glass . <sssss> i made a total mess -lrb- but i cleaned it up too ! <sssss> -rrb- anyway , i did n't follow the `` sauce guidelines '' listed on the wall and just went rogue . <sssss> this wasnlt a good idea . <sssss> i ended up with a really bland , soupy mess . <sssss> tgfs -lrb- thank goodness for siracha -rrb- or this would have been a big waste . <sssss> the meat fish and veggies were great , but i made the mistake of adding wheat noodles - blech ! <sssss> no taste and kinda gummy-kinda hard . <sssss> i would go back and stick with meat and veg and follow directions on the sauce cuz this place is clean and could be both healthy and tasty if done the right way .
?		went back for the matzo ball soup when i came down with a head cold and never felt better after eating it ! <sssss> the best i have had in town !
?		i 've had good times and not so good times here , but the good definitely outweighs the bad by far . <sssss> last friday i went for happy hour with a total of 7 friends -lrb- one of whom went insanely early in order to save us a table -rrb- . <sssss> arriving at 5:30 , i could n't believe how packed it was ! <sssss> no recession here ! <sssss> i love the music they play - it 's just feel-good , trendy pop , but it puts me in to mood to eat , drink and be merry ! <sssss> i always get the cowboy roll - which is spicy tuna with cucumbers , spicy sauce and scallions and it just does it for me . <sssss> for the first time i tried a friend 's chimichanga roll and must say that i am now a huge fan ! <sssss> it was even spicier than the cowboy and like a mini party in my mouth ! <sssss> my other fav thing here is the calamari ! <sssss> its lightly breaded and comes with the best tangy sauce that i always want to keep for later even though i do n't know what i would use it for . <sssss> i 'm just a sauce hoarder . <sssss> and at happy hour an order is only 4 bucks ! <sssss> beat that ? <sssss> i dont think so . <sssss> and the specialty rolls are only 8 bucks ! <sssss> sushi brokers always treats me well and i leave full , buzzed and happy . <sssss> just get there early to get a seat for happy hour !
?		buffalo wild wings is a typical chain and the food is as expected . <sssss> two of my favorite sauces here are the mango habanero and caribbean jerk . <sssss> the dining area at this location has a ton of tvs of various sizes and most seats in the dining area have a good view . <sssss> however , make sure not to get the corner booth near the stuffed animal claw machines . <sssss> some of your guests will not be able to see the tvs at all . <sssss> i recommend asking to switch if you get placed there . <sssss> the service at this location is quite poor and the restaurant seems to be running at very low efficiency . <sssss> to start , the hosts do not greet or even address customers as they arrive . <sssss> there seem to be a ton of servers in the dinning area , but you never see any of them working . <sssss> instead , they stand around in pairs talking . <sssss> meanwhile , our food took about 15 minutes to arrive , which seems unreasonable for a fried appetizer and 10 of their trademark wings . <sssss> lastly , we only saw our server twice . <sssss> one time was when we placed our order and the second -lrb- much to her fury -rrb- was when i had to walk our check up to the front of the restaurant to pay .
?		i have been to ra a few times and 2-3 have been at this location . <sssss> my most recent meal here was incredible . <sssss> the shishito peppers are a must-have . <sssss> the ponzu sauce had us tipping the empty bowl over to lick , drink , and pour on our remaining rice . <sssss> it was that good . <sssss> we tried the pacific roll , which is essentially the experience of eating fresh mango salsa . <sssss> it 's not what i would call sushi , but it was tasty and refreshing . <sssss> the sashimi is solid as well . <sssss> the lunch combo is ~ $ 10 and they will mix and match any 7 pieces of tuna/salmon/yellowtail you want . <sssss> this location , located in downtown tempe on mill ave , is a bit more of a club/bar style than the others i 've seen . <sssss> they play lots of upbeat club/remix/techno music at all times of day . <sssss> the service was friendly and decent .
?		arizona mills is a rather large mall and has a number of good outlet stores . <sssss> the imax and movie theater are good for catching a show . <sssss> the mall gets extremely crowded and it can be difficult to navigate through the mass of slow-walking mall zombies at times . <sssss> the food court is one of the dull spots , as it is occupied by cafeteria-style fast food chains . <sssss> however , there are some better snack shops scattered throughout the mall .
?		i visited sweet republic after hearing a lot about how good it was . <sssss> we split the pecan turtle sundae , which was plenty large for two or more people to indulge . <sssss> we requested to substitute one scoop of ice cream for a different flavor and it was headed without any trouble whatsoever . <sssss> the pecans and salted carmel were bursting with flavor and richness . <sssss> the ice cream was fresh and sweet . <sssss> it is a good idea to share , since the sweet salty richness is a bit much for one person to handle . <sssss> overall , the desert was amazing and i would like to visit here again . <sssss> i wish this place were n't so far away from home !
?		this is a very high end mall and not somewhere that i would buy anything . <sssss> there are tons of fashion/clothes shops , so perhaps it 's good if you like that sort of shopping . <sssss> there is also an apple store , which is cool . <sssss> i visited on a saturday afternoon . <sssss> there was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded . <sssss> for the number of large and fancy malls in the phoenix area , this one does n't measure up for me .
?		tempe marketplace is a modern , clean outdoor mall with a variety of stores . <sssss> for example , there is target , bestbuy , barnes and noble , and harkins theaters . <sssss> there are also a few different restaurants , including california pizza kitchen , kabuki , and red robin . <sssss> i go to tea infusion on every visit to get a drink before continuing with plans . <sssss> look for shaded parking in the corners/joints of the large lots near planted trees . <sssss> this market gets crowded on the weekends , so you may have to park away from the popular stores and getting in/out of the market is slow . <sssss> either way , you may need to walk across the large lots if you are going to stores that are n't in the same sector of the mall . <sssss> i prefer this mall to others in the area and tend to go there whenever it has what i 'm looking for .
?		we went back here for the first time since my last update and i can now confidently say that i wo n't be back again . <sssss> i 'm not sure what happened to this place , but it is n't the tea shop that i used to enjoy . <sssss> the staff is incompetent and did n't even listen to what customers said or even look at them . <sssss> we even saw other customers get ignored and have messed up orders while waiting for ours . <sssss> their tea menu has been severely cut and is missing the few good items that used to make it worth visiting .
?		this is the first japanese 60s-style diner i 've ever been to . <sssss> there was only one other table of people when i visited and the ambiance was dead silent . <sssss> only one older man working the front of house . <sssss> he took our order and delivered our dishes . <sssss> to pay , we walked up to the register . <sssss> the sashimi platter is a good choice for two to three people . <sssss> it came with a ton of tuna and salmon slices . <sssss> the miso , edamame , chicken yakitori skewer , and gyoza sides were tasty . <sssss> also included was an interesting cup of tiny salmon slices with scallions and a sweet soy sauce . <sssss> the tuna and eel rolls were nice , in case you prefer sushi to sashimi . <sssss> overall , the fish was good , but i have had better . <sssss> the prices are a bit high , but the dishes come with plenty of sushi , however , competitors like ra have higher quality fish . <sssss> due to the competition in the area , it is a bit tough to say i would come back . <sssss> however , i did have a good meal and got plenty of food .
?		the appetizers were okay . <sssss> the drinks were okay . <sssss> the pizza was okay . <sssss> the service was okay . <sssss> everything was oooooookaaaaaaaaay . <sssss> man , i think this mushroom is starting to kick in ...
?		have you ever gone to a place and were so overwhelmed by the menu options that you ultimately just point to some random item and say `` i want '' and pray that they do n't bring out a moose knuckle or a pot of sanka ? <sssss> that was our first experience at da vang . <sssss> we live in the neighborhood and i 've been wanting to check this place out for the better part of a year , but we never got around to it . <sssss> until tonight , that is . <sssss> honestly , i ca n't tell you what i had -lrb- it was the # 27 -rrb- but i can tell you it was wonderful ! <sssss> strikingly fresh vegetables , great meat ; amazing ! <sssss> and we arrived 15 minutes before they were scheduled to close on this monday evening . <sssss> -lsb- truth be told , we were n't the only ones going close to 8 p.m. . <sssss> at least half a dozen others were converging upon da vang as they were trying to close up shop , and all were allowed to order . <sssss> -rsb- da vang , now that i know you 're my little jewel in the strip mall -- and near a strip club , no less -- i shall be seeing more of you and sampling all your bounties .
?		i was really excited to go out to dinner friday night , because i had n't seen my honey in a week and a half . <sssss> and what better than sushi and a saki bomber to ease back into each other ? <sssss> we arrived at 8:50 p.m. and were seated almost immediately . <sssss> in the back . <sssss> trying to review our menus in the near darkness was n't easy . <sssss> ten minutes pass as tables around us get hovering attention . <sssss> we , however , were n't even offered drinks . <sssss> just when i was calling hana to see how late they were serving , someone finally came up to us for our drink order and appetizers . <sssss> our soup and appetizer came before our drinks . <sssss> the duece was our main course and mediocre at best . <sssss> i 'm used to my sushi/sashimi being a little cooler than room temp . <sssss> i echo the comments about a limited menu . <sssss> sorry , but i was n't impressed . <sssss> that does n't mean i wo n't try again ... but i do n't see myself waiting another 10 minutes while those around me are being serviced .
?		come for the creative reuse of pallets ; stay for the personal sized hammocks . <sssss> and the 20-or-so beers on tap . <sssss> i was walking back the to train after picking up some baby kale and noticed the hammocks and thought , `` what a crazy random happenstance ! '' <sssss> after ordering a beer , employee stephanie and i sat in two of those hammocks while she went over the menu . <sssss> it 's japanese and vietnamese inspired , but not all the items are currently available . <sssss> their soft opening was the 15th and i think they 're still looking for their groove . <sssss> nonetheless , the `` heart attack '' was a jalapeno delight . <sssss> stuffed with crab and deep fried : goodness ! <sssss> the octopus was a tad chewy , but i love octopus so i ate it . <sssss> i want to go back for the pho . <sssss> and to work my way through the beer selections .
?		i 've never really had any problems/issues coming to this best buy and i will admit that my rating is largely due to the geek squad , whom i positively adore -lrb- geeks are the new `` bad boys '' : swoon : -rrb- . <sssss> a couple of weeks ago my laptop suffered severe trauma and the dvd tray and hard drive became victimized by this incident , to the point that the computer was inoperable . <sssss> fortunately , it was under an extended warranty and the repairs were covered . <sssss> the geek squad was courteous in assessing the damage and getting the computer shipped out for repairs , plus informed me about ordering a recovery disc from sony . <sssss> when i went to pick up the computer , the staff were thorough about verifying my identity and validity of picking up the computer -lrb- the service contract is in robert m 's name -rrb- . <sssss> since i work in a bank , i appreciate this effort as i would n't want someone else walking off with my lifeline . <sssss> my only complaint is , we were told the hard drive would be returned with the repaired laptop so we could have a friend try to salvage any information -lrb- it was going to cost $ 250-1 ,700 if they did it -rrb- . <sssss> unfortunately , we must have signed something indicating that any components removed from the computer would become the property of the service site . <sssss> ho hum ! <sssss> i already knew i 'd have to rediscover all my porn , now my music and photos are gone , too . <sssss> i suppose this is a lesson in backing up one 's computer and data . <sssss> and a lesson to put the computer on a stable surface when doing some supersonic idiotic disconnected not respected rap and dance number from an 80s classic teen movie . <sssss> i can live with this .
?		when robert m and i were in san francisco for his birthday week , we went to the 21st amendment brewery -lrb- soma neighborhood -rrb- and were introduced to the hell or high water watermelon wheat ale . <sssss> whoever thought that up is a genius , pure genius !! <sssss> we were under the assumption that to experience anything remotely near that , we 'd have to go back there . <sssss> well , we did n't have to go too far , it turns out , to get a great microbrew beer and mighty fine eats . <sssss> enter four peaks brewery : the valley 's answer to beer connoisseur 's question `` where does one go locally to imbibe on regional ales et . <sssss> al. ? '' <sssss> four peaks has so many things going for it . <sssss> they ided me -lrb- loves it ! <sssss> -rrb- , which really helps my ego in these , my more ancient hours . <sssss> they have converted a warehouse effectively into a sweet dining location . <sssss> the wait staff is quite efficient . <sssss> their selection of beers is tops . <sssss> and the food is pretty darned good . <sssss> we started out with the peach ale , a slightly sweet beer with a clean finish and truly a masterpiece . <sssss> our appetizer was the calamari -lrb- are you kidding me ?? <sssss> that 's a whole squid ! <sssss> -rrb- i went for the popper burger , a delightful combination of beef -- medium rare -- jalapeños , cream cheese and onion fries . <sssss> this is n't for wussies , which is why i did n't get far in finishing this . <sssss> as good as it was , i suppose i was n't cut out for such intense peppers on my burger . <sssss> ship me back to ohio , postage due . <sssss> overall , i thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at four peaks . <sssss> what knicks the fifth star was that it was rather warm in the section in which we were seated and there was no shortage of flies . <sssss> yes , i get that we 're in the valley and it 's turning summer , and that we were basically eating outdoors . <sssss> four peaks ca n't control the weather nor the insects . <sssss> but i 'm home now and really jonesing that peach ale and have no immediate means of getting one . <sssss> so , allow me this minor infraction .
?		caffe boa is not what i 'd call an affordable night out on the town . <sssss> that might explain why after work on a thursday it was nowhere near capacity . <sssss> but , i 'd also have to state that caffe boa 's business model lends itself well to catering to more of a white collar clientele . <sssss> with the exception of the cheese board , our experience here was exclusively centered on cocktails . <sssss> i started out with the maple leaf , an enchanting mixture of bouron and whipped maple syrup , followed by the petal pusher and capped it off with a gin martini -lrb- no olive , of course , because they take up so much room in such a small glass -rrb- . <sssss> the damage : $ 35.13 . <sssss> so , a bit steep . <sssss> but , their cocktails are n't some genaric concoction any home-bartender could muddle out . <sssss> these were classic , signature cocktails , skillfully combined by practiced mixologists . <sssss> ultimately , i 'd have to confess that caffe boa is a jewel . <sssss> admittedly , the bar area -lrb- which is where the happy hour specials begin and end -rrb- is limited , so you have to get there early to take advantage of the special pricing .
?		have i really never reviewed lo-lo 's ? <sssss> seriously ?? <sssss> this morning , dottsy , robert m and i headed for sodo -lrb- is that what the hipsters are calling the area just south of downtown ? <sssss> -rrb- for some chicken and waffle perfection . <sssss> lo-lo 's hits the mark on everything : my gravy and onion covered chicken was all sorts of awesomeness , the waffles were golden brown loveliness , the greens were bang on , the mac and cheese a creamy blissful experience , the red beans and rice were smartly appealing and the fried okra was splendid happiness . <sssss> sure , we ordered a lot of sides , but we wanted to be fair . <sssss> lo-lo 's was like a religious experience -- sunday service was being played on the radio , there were babies crying , their food is also served in heaven -lrb- or at least that 's keeping me focused on the afterlife -rrb- . <sssss> as well as being perfectly filled with some of the best food ever , we also had a marketing brainstorming session . <sssss> the first was a tour of some great soul food restaurants using metro and make it into a uye . <sssss> its name ? <sssss> pause for dramatic effect : the soul train . <sssss> something else came up but we 're keeping a tight lid on that project .
?		for some reason , i always worry that 3-stars is a bad thing . <sssss> it 's not , really . <sssss> just an indication that it 's good but not great . <sssss> foccacia fiorentina represents this philosophy , to me . <sssss> while i 've not had a bad pizza here , they do require thinking ahead enough to call in my order before i walk over , thus maximizing my lunch hour . <sssss> but if i 'm just walking around looking for something to jump out at me , not such a good thing . <sssss> such was the case for my most recent visit to ff . <sssss> pressed for time , i decided on two pasta dishes -- one a creamy cheese and mushroom sauce , the other a balsamic vinegar mixed with fresh basil , tomatoes and mozzarella . <sssss> individually , they sound very good . <sssss> but the reality fell short of my expectations . <sssss> maybe if i 'd gotten them in separate containers it would have felt differently about my meal . <sssss> i 'll stick to pizzas in the future .
?		bring your jacket , because it 's colder than winter in here . <sssss> seriously , i had to warm up outside half way through the night . <sssss> and i tend to get cranky when i 'm cold . <sssss> it 's a good thing there was plenty of alcohol to set my mind at ease . <sssss> whether it 's being irish or just fond of it , i feel i must get at least one guinness if it 's available at a bar or restaurant . <sssss> so , that 's how i started my evening at sidebar . <sssss> also offered are a nice selection of specialty cocktails using their fresh-squeezed juices . <sssss> i sampled several without getting all the names . <sssss> i prefer drinks that are n't overly sweet , enjoy pretty much anything with absinthe , and am game for anything new and unusual . <sssss> sidebar delivers . <sssss> i really enjoy the movies they play here , too . <sssss> although the sofa on which we were sitting did n't have a great view of the tvs , we were able to wiggle around to take in most of the movie -lrb- `` sin city '' followed by `` kill bill : vol 1 '' -rrb- .
?		i 've been here several times for drinking , once for a movie , and twice for the walking dead . <sssss> at this point , i do n't think there is any other way i can possibly watch this show , because the beers are great and audience interaction just heightens the experience . <sssss> perhaps the only bad thing is , this cuts into the time i 'd normally be watching revenge . <sssss> but i can always catch up on that .
?		fuego bistro : this is what a bistro should be . <sssss> had it not been for a great deal on groupon , i do n't know if robert m and i would have made it for dinner here . <sssss> it 's not that we had n't thought about it , it 's just that it 's oddly located . <sssss> but that 's neither here nor there , because last night we dined -- and we dined well . <sssss> we started our date with sangria -- robert the white and i the red . <sssss> initially i thought i 'd erred in my decision -lrb- the white was fruity and intense while the first taste of the red was merely okay -rrb- . <sssss> but then the complexity of the red unfolded , as spices piqued out and enveloped the glass . <sssss> either way , both are exceptional . <sssss> our first course was the empenadas . <sssss> in a word : magnificent ! <sssss> the perfectly flaky crust and the robust filling could be an entire meal of its own . <sssss> i , however , would do away with the hot sauce served on the side . <sssss> just a preference , or if they had a house salsa that would be good . <sssss> main course was the pollo ajedrea for robert and the daily special -lrb- chile rellenos stuffed with scallops , shrimp and tilapia -rrb- for me . <sssss> sides were chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes for both of us and black beans for rob and green beans for myself . <sssss> after sampling our own entrees , we tried each other 's . <sssss> to be honest , after being blown away by my dish , the chicken was a bit flat , and that by no means indicates it was n't very good . <sssss> it 's just that i was so amazed by the chile rellenos . <sssss> it was one of the things of which i dreamt last night . <sssss> those mashed potatoes were another thing dancing through my head . <sssss> : dreamy eyes : it 's located in a ballet studio complex , which is enchanting . <sssss> there is also a lovely patio which some braved the cold last night on which to dine and be entertained by a local musician . <sssss> once the weather becomes more tolerable , i 'll give it a go . <sssss> service was fantastic ! <sssss> susan was genuinely friendly , as if we were regulars , and cemented the deal that we would be back again and again . <sssss> fuego bistro has an incredible happy hour , from what i understand , that runs from 3-6 p.m. tuesday through saturday . <sssss> yes , boys and girls , i said saturday . <sssss> they have about two dozen items from their menu for $ 5 -lrb- including those empenadas -rrb- and assorted cocktails . <sssss> this could turn in to a sordid love affair , if i do n't mind myself .
?		the roosevelt seeps a cool vibe that can only be attained by converting a historic house into a den of drunkeness . <sssss> ah , a banker 's dream . <sssss> this is where my coworker , dani , and i went after eating at sens. she was going to a blind date and did n't want to show up alone , for fear that this guy would be a total psycho who would cut her hair and eat it in front of her . <sssss> but this time , i already had two incredibly strong and delicious martinis from sens and was very glad to have taken the light rail . <sssss> i ordered the oatmeat stout and was quite pleased with it . <sssss> can i just say how much i loved the decor ? <sssss> i totally want to move in here ... or use it as inspiration for our next home . <sssss> so , the blind date guy was n't a total scode and i let after half an hour . <sssss> dani , who was apprehensive about meeting this guy -- who 's a doctor , and i told her if she was n't interested toss him my way -lrb- sorry , honey -rrb- -- ended up having a good time with a nice guy . <sssss> we both ended the night exactly the same : passed out with a cocktail in our hands .
?		outstanding . <sssss> pork leg , tots , beers , food . <sssss> good . <sssss> now go eat .
?		i frequent the salon at the resort . <sssss> michael belville the salon supervisor has been taking care of my locks for about 6 years . <sssss> we first met when he worked for the westin kierland agave spa . <sssss> michael got my hair back to health after too many trips to a popular salon in town and that ended up over treated . <sssss> since then i have never received more compliments on my hair in my life . <sssss> one day i was standing in line at the check out in the grocery store and i could feel someone touching my hair . <sssss> no kidding . <sssss> the woman told me she thought my hair was so beautiful . <sssss> seriously , all thanks to michael ! <sssss> when michael left to go to the sancturary resort i followed him there . <sssss> are you kidding me ? <sssss> you know how serious a girl is about her hair . <sssss> and after receiving so many compliments it was the right thing to do ! <sssss> a couple of months ago i arrived to the salon with the lights out and no electricity to heat the water . <sssss> you would have thought i would have had the sense to reschedule but it would have taken the earth to open up and swallow the salon for me to leave without my highlights treated . <sssss> this is how far i will go to have michael do my hair . <sssss> the staff is always so friendly . <sssss> i appreciate the email i receive to confirm my appointments and a personal phone call for a friendly reminder . <sssss> thank you sanctuary resort and michael !
?		okay , i have to start with that i am a bit biased because my boyfriend is one of the managers at zinc bistro but i have always been a big fan of matt carter and at zinc well before ben and i started dating . <sssss> the food is amazing . <sssss> the atmosphere gorgeous and the staff is friendly and accommodating . <sssss> i have tried almost everything on the menu and could go on and on about the details . <sssss> trust me it is outstanding ! <sssss> most importantly matt and terry have brought an outstanding venue for everyone to enjoy . <sssss> brian and emily are gracious with their hospitality and working hard to make it happen at the mission . <sssss> got to run because now i am hungry thinking about the place . <sssss> going to the mission !!!!
?		just get there ! <sssss> micah 's cocktails are amazing . <sssss> such a great talent . <sssss> the truffle popcorn is ridiculous ! <sssss> you can order from crudo 's menu as well . <sssss> albacore , ahi tuna , polenta and ricotta are outstanding . <sssss> love this place .
?		i enjoyed the prime rib , and i thought it was reasonably priced . <sssss> we sat in the bar which was noisy , but we still got good service from the waitress . <sssss> the trout and cous cous was also very good . <sssss> we split the banana cream pie for desert and it was so fresh with real banana 's . <sssss> would definitely go back .
?		i wish this place was n't so busy ! <sssss> it is always packed ! <sssss> if i did n't have to worry about things like cholesterol , or trans fat , i would eat here more often . <sssss> great hot dogs , on a real grill with real hand dipped onion rings .
?		happy hour at the bar was the best ! <sssss> great prices on their amazing fresh and flavorful food , tasty drinks to wash em down .
?		wooo hoo ! <sssss> halliluja i think someone anwsered my prayers and hired all new wait staff ! <sssss> i had previously stopped coming here despite the great food , the service was just ssooo slow and crappy ! <sssss> but low and behold i went to breakfast , on a saturday morning none the less and had refills brought over before my glass was empty , got the check delivered before i had to ask , and got out of there within an hour ! <sssss> a new orange table record . <sssss> not to mention the expresso was delish , and the catlan scramble was an amazing blend of salty briney olives with spicy chorizo , mixed with ripe tomato and melty manchego cheese . <sssss> loved it .
?		the food is really good here . <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed with the quality and great taste . <sssss> service is very fast too . <sssss> only issues i had were no wi-fi , and the portions were a little on the smaller side . <sssss> however , i 'm 6 ' 4 and 208 pounds , so for most people , the food sizes are appropriate . <sssss> i had the pulled pork sandwich , collard greens , and beef bbq sandwich . <sssss> both were freaking tasty as hell . <sssss> maybe they can add some bigger size options for us big guys ? <sssss> either way , i 'll be back , and am looking forward to enjoying their food and wonderful clean restaurant .
?		amazing selection of food . <sssss> vegetarian and vegan friendly . <sssss> great service . <sssss> high quality food and great selection of wines . <sssss> reasonably priced . <sssss> wonderful atmosphere and great outdoor seating . <sssss> what else do you want ?? <sssss> : -rrb-
?		the food here is great and service is excellent . <sssss> do not come here if you want traditional/authentic mexican food . <sssss> its super americanized , but that is not necessarily a bad thing .
?		holy good mother of god . <sssss> now this is what i 'm talking about !!! <sssss> hot pizza , a full salad bar , awesome sandwiches , a frigging winebar , an bbq bistro and a ethnic food bar mixed with an outstanding selection of crisp , unique beverages to wash it all down with . <sssss> oh yeah , i forgot , they 're one hellva grocery store too ; -rrb-
?		okay 4 stars for the joynt . <sssss> troy s. summed it up best with saying it 's `` good for a standard breakfast '' , because it really is nothing special , picture that `` grease spoon '' place that your dad always used to take you to and take out the flies , ugly staff and shady location . <sssss> poof you 've got the breakfast joynt , everything you 've ever wanted in a breakfast place without the cons . <sssss> while maybe one con , let a girl do the decorating , it looks like i decorated the place for christ 's sake .
?		surprisingly i 'm going to give 4 stars to sushi roku . <sssss> here 's why ... being that it was my first time to this location i was super skeptical because it sits at the w hotel in old town scottsdale , which is nice but , it 's a restaurant , not some hot sushi/club scene that came here from la as people portray it to be . <sssss> so i was smart , i went on a monday night when i knew the affliction and ufc crowd would be to a minimum and the staff could actually concentrate and relax instead of bustling around rushing because of a shouting , rude clientele . <sssss> not to my surprise the experience was exceptional , the staff was hands down friendly , confident in the chef and on track with recommendations including a delicious pairing with a bottle of chilled sake . <sssss> i opted for the steak wrapped asparagus to begin and the stimulus menu for a main course . <sssss> to those who do n't know , the stimulus menu is a 3 course meal served for $ 30.00 where you can choose either `` land '' or `` sea '' and yes , it 's okay to mis-match them too . <sssss> i had the `` land '' as my first course which constitutes 3 of the restaurants most popular items , steak , chicken , etc and all were prepared absolutely to spec , well except maybe my steak was a tad cold but meh , everything was going awesome so far so why screw it up by complaining . <sssss> the second course however i had the `` sea '' version in which 4 different pieces of nigiri are served with 3 different types of roll , also note , you can substitute fish in case you are n't feeling shrimp or whatever they serve you , a total plus . <sssss> third course is green tea ice cream , always a winner in my book . <sssss> to sum it up i 'd say this location met my expectations with what i had become accustomed to with the la locations , i 'll be back for sure , just never on a weekend , not in scottsdale at least .
?		yuck , blah , cough , phfooy , gag . <sssss> hearing everyone talk this place up , we headed over for some post drinking philly 's one night which as we all know , is like god 's gift to you at 2 am . <sssss> funny part is though , even hammered the philly i had was bland , the meat rubbery and the cheese non tasteful ? <sssss> huh ???????? <sssss> how do you screw this up ??? <sssss> it 's a philly , it 's supposed to be like 3000000 calories of awesome-ness and fatty ingredients should be used liberally . <sssss> not here , expect a bland philly which will just leave you pissed off and craving ny pizza from the awesome place down the street .
?		i came in here for a co-workers birthday lunch , and i was very impressed with the place . <sssss> first off , you ca n't beat the $ 8.99 lunchtime buffet . <sssss> they had your traditional indian offerings out there , such as curry chicken and tandoori chicken , along with some others options that those who might be more versed in indian cuisine might give a try . <sssss> the naan was crisp and our basket kept getting refilled as it became empty . <sssss> the service was a little slow , even though it was a buffet , but since i work in the area i see myself coming back here time and time again for lunch .
?		located in the heritage square area -lrb- right across from pizzeria bianco -rrb- , the rose and crown is a great little bar that packs a ton of laid back charm . <sssss> as a converted house , the front porch area has plenty of room for sitting outside and enjoying a pint or four with friends . <sssss> the beer selection is good , with local favorites like four peaks mixed in with your irish/british beers . <sssss> i have not eaten here yet , so i can not comment on the food . <sssss> once you step inside , they 've managed to keep the individual `` rooms '' of the house , making it feel like you are truly still in a house . <sssss> one room as a pool table , another has some seats and real darts -lrb- not that plastic crap -rrb- , yet another is full of tables and chairs for your dining enjoyment . <sssss> service has always been friendly and attentive , and the people that roll into this place are from all walks of life . <sssss> parking can sometimes be a pain , due to its location near the sporting venues , but if a no-frills laid back place for a beer is what you seek , look no further .
?		once you eat here , you 'll never want to go to another chipotle-like place again . <sssss> the food here is amazing , and it all boils down to the sweet pork . <sssss> so delicious , and if i 'm ever unfortunate enough to have to head to the electric chair , a sweet pork burrito from this place is definitely on my last meal list . <sssss> the line can be long during lunch hour , but the wait is definitely worth it . <sssss> and it can be a bit noisy inside from all the people - but again , still worth it . <sssss> side note : for all new mothers , i swear that this place must be listed on some official list of places to take your little one and meet up with other mothers with their little ones , because i 'm always shocked at how many moms and kids are in this joint during lunch hour .
?		when i am in the area , i like to frequent this cheesecake factory for lunch . <sssss> i always try to go early or late , but never right at noon . <sssss> this location is nestled between plenty of office buildings and if you go right at noon , there will surely be a wait . <sssss> today i got the same great food and service ! <sssss> after glancing at the novel-sized menu and wrestling in my mind what to have ... i had my usual : the shrimp and bacon club sandwich . <sssss> i always order mine without the middle slice of bread . <sssss> there are few reasons why i do this : 1 . <sssss> i ca n't fit the double decker sandwich in my mouth 2 . <sssss> it makes the sandwich more packed full of shrimp and bacon ! <sssss> 3 . <sssss> less calories - which i guess makes up for the bacon and fries i had ! <sssss> all in all the sandwich was delish ! <sssss> they have a new nifty metal fry holder that kept my fries hot , too !
?		we used to go here a lot ... until they took the smoked ham off their menu !!! <sssss> the waitress told us that not many people liked it , but every time i was there , people were eating it . <sssss> the smoked ham was our family 's favorite , so we have n't been back since - bring back the ham !!!
?		grimaldi 's , i love your food , but your customer service is horrible , therefore i am forced to rate you as a 1 . <sssss> let 's take last night as an example . <sssss> i went to pick up my large pizza and a salad . <sssss> i saw my pizza come out , i saw two guys opening the box , looking at the pizza and discussing something . <sssss> one guys comes over to me , quickly opens the lid and says `` isthisok ? '' <sssss> -lrb- yup all in one word . <sssss> -rrb- i said `` uhh yeah , i guess so '' ... `` but wait it looks a little small to be a large . '' <sssss> he says - oh yeah it 's between a medium and a large , but we will give you your salad for free . <sssss> so , if i would have said `` yes , it looks fine , '' they would have left me walk out of there with something less than what i paid for ?! <sssss> plus now i have a pizza that will not fill up my family ? <sssss> when i ask for a new pizza he grudgingly says `` well its gon na take 20-25 minutes . '' <sssss> so , i leave ... with a small pizza and a crappy wilted salad ... and do n't expect anyone to hold the door for you either ... they are all too busy gabbing around the guest kiosk . <sssss> ps - this is the 2nd time my order was messed up and i must say even domino 's and pizza hut have never messed up my pizza size or toppings !
?		what a mixed bag for me . <sssss> i used to love this place , i really did . <sssss> there was a time when a group of my friends considered fibbers to be their seccond home - and we were here at least two or three times a month . <sssss> -lrb- some are there almost daily - i would only make the trek a couple times a month . <sssss> -rrb- the drinks were poured well and reasonably priced , the food was tasty and the music was great . <sssss> real craic in that room ! <sssss> not sure what happened over the past couple of years - but wow , last night was hit and miss across the board . <sssss> a group of us met to bid farewell to a friend moving out of state . <sssss> the drinks are still solid -lrb- they have real ginger ale , which is getting more and more rare with many bars opting to mix coke and sprite for the right color - flavor be damned . <sssss> -rrb- the food was pretty spot on , too - though i am not thrilled with some of the menu changes and do n't get others . <sssss> -lrb- gone are the fried mushooms - which were fantastic . <sssss> for an irish pub - why the section of medditerannean flatbread pizza ?? <sssss> the items i saw were well presented - but along with the `` upgrade '' to the menu , some of the local pub flavor has been lost . <sssss> -rrb- i had the fish and chips . <sssss> with the size of the cod filet that showed up , it 's a damn good thing i was sharing with another gal - that sucker was huge ! <sssss> the beer batter was flavorful and fried to crispy golden perfection - the cod was still moist and tasty - a truly enjoyable dish . <sssss> it was on a bed of fries - somewhat thicker than shoestring , but thinner than normal - skin on and well cooked . <sssss> the coleslaw was ok - seemed commercial grade - but nothing wrong with it . <sssss> so - why only three stars ? <sssss> service and music . <sssss> our server was adorabe . <sssss> cute , sweet , friendly and great smile . <sssss> and damn near totally inept . <sssss> there were five of us at our table . <sssss> with the first round of drinks , three of us asked for water in addition to our libations . <sssss> none of us got them . <sssss> so we asked again when the food was dropped off . <sssss> nothing . <sssss> the party next to us had some styro cups and an almost empty pitcher of water . <sssss> i grabbed the cups , filled what i could , and took the pitcher to the bar to get refilled . <sssss> when we wanted a fresh round of drinks , it took over 20 minutes of empty dinner plates and empty cocktail and beer glasses before she came around . <sssss> no pre-bussing was done as plated were emptied - and when she did come by to grab dishes , she looked so focused and did n't make eye contact that without grabbing her , it would have been impossible to ask for more drinks . <sssss> the disturbing part was when i ordered an irish coffee -lrb- yes , i am aware that irish coffee is not from ireland - it 's from san francisco - but in this day and age , ordering irish coffee at an irish pub just makes good sense . <sssss> -rrb- the look i got from our waitress was a combo of deer in the headlights , confused , and `` what language did you just say that in ? '' <sssss> happily , the bartender knows just what it is , and i received a good one - but the look she gave when i asked for it was more than a little unsettling . <sssss> and noted by the people around me , as well . <sssss> at the end of the night , i had to search the bar to find her to get my tab . <sssss> i guess that 's the irony of of the automatic 18 % gratuity for groups . <sssss> she does n't actually have to work to make the money . <sssss> why should she ? <sssss> do a half assed job and get 18 % , or truly work and do a good job and maybe get another 4 or 5 % on average ? <sssss> so - it 's there to ensure she does n't get stiffed , but it also does n't provide any reason for her to do a decent job . <sssss> sigh . <sssss> the band was really , really bad . <sssss> they used to bring in local bands with irish flavor - who were good . <sssss> the band last night -lrb- and from conversation with regulars , most of the bands of late -rrb- could not be classified as good . <sssss> but , what they lacked in talent they more than made up for in volume . <sssss> the best part of the show was when they took breaks . <sssss> sure - it may not be fair to take a star away from the establishment based on my feelings toward the band - but it was impossible to overlook . <sssss> if that 's the caliber of bands fibbers is bringing in on weekends now , i think i know what i will have to do in the future . <sssss> # 1 - only show up during the week and # 2 - sit at the bar . <sssss> hopefully when clayton in there - as he knows just what he 's doing and has the charm and personality that keeps me feeling like a valued customer .
?		one of my roommates was extolling the beauty of bosa . <sssss> i asked if they were as good as rainbow , but she had never tried rainbow . <sssss> so - we decided to do a taste test . <sssss> three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different -lrb- but like -rrb- donuts from each . <sssss> the plan was to bring them back home , cut to sample size , and note flavor , texture and overall preference . <sssss> the guy roommate 's favorite is glazed raised . <sssss> the gal leans to sugar raised and i figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing . <sssss> we went to rainbow first . <sssss> no problem getting the donuts we wanted . <sssss> i also picked up a half dozen donut holes . <sssss> was not thrilled to be charged $ 0.50 for the box , but c'est la vie . <sssss> girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink . <sssss> a bit sweet for my tastes , but very , very watermelony . <sssss> next stop bosa . <sssss> they did n't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead . <sssss> -lrb- i have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar did n't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at rainbow ! <sssss> -rrb- so the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison , but we 'd make do . <sssss> no problem with the glzed and old fashioned . <sssss> we also picked up ham and swiss croissants . <sssss> one can never have too much pastry , right ? <sssss> : -rrb- results - glazed raised - bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction . <sssss> rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light . <sssss> great texture , but we did n't feel satisfied from chewing . <sssss> rainbow was slightly sweeter . <sssss> ~ votes - 3 for bosa . <sssss> ~ old fashioned - textures were identical . <sssss> rainbow had a slight lemon -lrb- or maybe aspatrame ? <sssss> -rrb- flavor in the back end of the tasting . <sssss> ~ votes - 1 slight lean to bosa , 2 draw ~ sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above . <sssss> -lrb- duh - same donut , different topping . <sssss> -rrb- the gal roomie likes granulated . <sssss> the guy roomie preferred the powdered . <sssss> i liked both . <sssss> ~ votes - 1 bosa , 1 rainbow , 1 draw . <sssss> so , bosa comes out with a slight edge . <sssss> and we came out with a slight sugar rush . <sssss> i ca n't help but wonder what our next scientific food research challenge will be !
?		i 've lived in this city a long time . <sssss> i 've heard great things about christopher 's for as many years as i can remember - and even better things about the happy hour . <sssss> i never made in until this week for restaurant week . <sssss> shame on me for waiting so damn long ! <sssss> my dining partner and i decided to share each course so we could sample more of the offerings , and we both opted for the wine pairings for each course . <sssss> first up was a bowl with goat cheese filled mini ravioli with herbs and truffle in the light and lovely sauce , and the mixed greens with goat cheese in parmesan crust . <sssss> both were a great way to start the meal - but the winner of the two was the salad . <sssss> second course we shared frog legs and an onion tart with bacon . <sssss> it was my first experience with munching one of kermit 's kickers - i thought it was tasty , but my companion felt it was a bit under seasoned . <sssss> the onion tart was perfect . <sssss> -lrb- hands down winner of the course - we each lamented sharing it , wishing we had each ordered our own . <sssss> -rrb- third course was sole sauteed with lobster sauce and coq au vin . <sssss> the chicken was perfectly cooked - still super moist and juicy , and the flavor was solid . <sssss> the sole , however , was heavenly ! <sssss> absolute perfection on a plate . <sssss> rich , but still light filet of sole , the lobster sauce was almost a bisque . <sssss> served with cauliflower , this is definitely a dish to return for ! <sssss> we shared a great chocolatey dessert - with killer chocolate sorbet ! <sssss> -lrb- the sorbet was better than the layer cake -rrb- - and a great little plus was being presented with a restaurant week celebratory baguette after we 'd paid . <sssss> i will definitely be back - it 's so good , and so close to home ... christopher 's , you are now on my regular rotation !
?		i made it to french grocery today for the soft opening . <sssss> and there is a lot to be done before a true grand opening , but i am loving what i see so far ! <sssss> we ordered 3 cafe au lait -lrb- with chickory , as it should be ! <sssss> -rrb- and 2 orders of beignet to go . <sssss> as an impulse , we also got a bag of zapp 's potato chips . <sssss> the cafe au lait were perfect ! <sssss> the beignet were a bit overdone -lrb- it was mentioned the oil had gotten a bit too hot -rrb- - but totally on the right track ! <sssss> the flavor , texture and size was spot on - just a wee bit overdone . <sssss> we are definitely happy campers ! <sssss> as mentioned - i was there right after opening on the very first day of the soft opening - so there are absolutely some kinks to work out , and more inventory to add . <sssss> for today , there was a limited selection of pastry , dry goods and cold drinks , with lots of empty shelf space , cooler space and bakery case space . <sssss> i am looking forward to coming back by in the coming weeks and months to watch the place fill up - it is a great space , and the friendliness of the owners and staff is welcoming . <sssss> a great addition to the area , and hopefully a great part of the community for a long time to come . <sssss> i 'm definitely a fan !
?		the fantastic mr. it 's complicated and i went here for lunch today , and as we 'd experienced separately in the past - the food was great ! <sssss> based on the foods he 's disgusted by , i did n't order what i was in the mood for - had he seen it , he may not have been able to eat at all . <sssss> so i went with the new yorker -lrb- corned beef , pastrami , slaw and russian dressing -rrb- on rye with the slaw on the side . <sssss> he had the black forest -lrb- turkey , corned beef , grilled onions and swiss . <sssss> -rrb- both are served with pickles -lrb- i believe house-made -rrb- and fries . <sssss> the bread is great , the meat quality is great - and as we both packed half a sandwich and most of the fries into boxes for another meal , we were reminded that maybe next time we should just share a sandwich . <sssss> like all good delis - the portions are huge . <sssss> and like all good jewish delis - the service is subpar , the decor is hopelessly dated , the prices are definitely fair for the quality and quantity , and something about it just feels like `` home . '' <sssss> i made a mistake though . <sssss> i ordered coffee instead of a chocolate egg cream . <sssss> too few places make a decent egg cream - and i missed my opportunity . <sssss> then again , that 's a good excuse to have to go back soon ! <sssss> -lrb- as if i needed one ! <sssss> -rrb-
?		my roommate and i were throwing a party , and i was brave enough to decide to do a full louisiana style shrimp boil . <sssss> it 's not shrimp season . <sssss> : -lrb- the price per pound was more than i expected - and i realized that either a hispanic or asian market is the way to go for getting a good deal . <sssss> ranch market had medium shrimp , shell and head on , in frozen 4 pound boxes . <sssss> perfect - as i was getting 20 pounds ! <sssss> the roommate and i headed down around noon on saturday . <sssss> we were both hungry , so decided to grab a bite before shopping . <sssss> he had a bowl of posole and a quesadilla . <sssss> i wanted the sopa - but they were n't offered that day , so opted for the taco salad with carne asada instead . <sssss> delicioso ! <sssss> i opted for a jamaica to wash it down - but now the watermelon agua fresca is calling to me ! <sssss> the dining area -lrb- lots of picnic tables -rrb- was clean . <sssss> the salsa/condiment bar was fresh and well stocked . <sssss> every employee we dealt with was friendly and efficient . <sssss> after filling our bellies , we got some produce -lrb- all was very fresh , well displayed and notably less expensive than the fry 's near the house -rrb- , picked up the shrimp and headed out . <sssss> i know i will be back for more specialty items , produce , meat and fish - and the bakery section ! <sssss> it 's a bit far out of my way to do the regular weekly grocery shopping here - especially as we 're getting into summer and i do n't know i could get perishables home before they perish ... but ranch is hitting my rotation for sure !
?		hellllloooooo , whole paycheck ! <sssss> i braved the crowds - i survived the parking lot -lrb- in and out -rrb- and the newest whole foods is open in my hood . <sssss> sure - the store is comparable to every other wf i 've been in . <sssss> the bar is not . <sssss> helllloooooo , 20 highland tavern ! <sssss> 36 beers on tap - 26 of them local . <sssss> and tables and tvs and foods and happy hour ! <sssss> yup - i 'll end up here far more than my budget wants me to . <sssss> i regret not going for the way discounted and amazing looking salmon and ahi . <sssss> i cheer myself for jumping in on the $ 9.99 / lb choice ny strip steaks - cut to order . <sssss> they are beautiful ! <sssss> welcome to the hood , whole foods . <sssss> we 're destined to spend a whole lot of time together , and i really hope i get that raise at work . <sssss> soon .
?		weekend with my sister , who was visiting from nyc . <sssss> we spent the weekend in sedona/jerome and were making dinner for a small group of us sunday evening . <sssss> dessert was the easiest part of dinner to figure out - stop at rock springs and get pie ! <sssss> we picked up the jack daniels pecan pie and the peach pie . <sssss> we were curious about the tennessee lemon - but the staff we spoke with were clearly not lemon fans and two of the three made `` bitter lemon '' face and mentioned it was really tart . <sssss> sadly , without taking the extra time to sit and try a slice , they did n't make samples available - so we did the peach instead . <sssss> -lrb- lemon , you 're on my list ! <sssss> -rrb- both pies were fantastic -lrb- as always -rrb- and my sister got a huge kick out of the slice of americana that is rock springs cafe . <sssss> yes , they do more than pie . <sssss> and all the food is fresh , tasty and good portions at fair prices . <sssss> while we did n't eat on this pass through , i 've eaten there several times in years past , and each experience has met or exceeded expectations . <sssss> but really , it 's all about the pie ! <sssss> and grabbing one on my way back down the mountain from various adventures north is generally on my list of things to do . <sssss> definitely worth the stop !
?		i have to give compound a middle of the road three stars based on averaging several experiences here . <sssss> i 've had stellar times , i 've had awful times - but the music will keep me coming back . <sssss> am i rating a music venue that serves food , or a food venue that spotlights live music ? <sssss> if the former , i 'd give the place 4 stars . <sssss> the latter would get 2 . <sssss> so - here we are , back at .3 . <sssss> the service has been pretty consistently awful across the board . <sssss> i do n't think i 've had what i 'd consider good service ever . <sssss> the most recent vist came close . <sssss> but did involve waiting almost a half hour to be aknowledged at the table , and a very strange cocktail incident . <sssss> i ordered an irish coffee . <sssss> i ended up getting a deconstructed version . <sssss> she asked if i wanted it with bailey 's or `` just '' whisky . <sssss> well , irish coffee does n't have bailey 's , so i opted for the `` just whisky '' version . <sssss> the waitress came back with my water and my friend 's beer and told me they just put up fresh coffee for me . <sssss> yay ! <sssss> then she comes with a shot glass of whisky . <sssss> the sugar caddy was already on the table . <sssss> then comes the mug of coffee and cream . <sssss> it 's a build your own irish coffee bar ! <sssss> just like byo bloody mary - but not . <sssss> given this was the second not-acceptable experience with irish coffee in two weeks - at two places - i am thinking it gets relegated to an `` at home '' drink for me ! <sssss> over the past couple of years , i have had several items off the menu -lrb- apps , entrees and desserts -rrb- and have had the buffet sometimes served on the patio . <sssss> i love the concept of what they 're doing with food -lrb- local , organic where possibe , etc. -rrb- - the execution is lacking and the prices reflect the n scottsdale location . <sssss> like i said - it 's not the food , it 's not the service - the music will keep me coming back . <sssss> i can eat and drink at other places before and after - but when you want to see a specific performer or band - and that 's where they 're booked - you can overlook the crap service , right ? <sssss> positive side note - they recently raised the stage - so for standing room only shows , you can actually see the band now , even if you 're not in the front row !
?		about as pretentious as it gets in scottsdale . <sssss> dark and noisy . <sssss> expensive drinks . <sssss> not really my kinda a place . <sssss> but if you 're into that kind of thing ...
?		one of the best happy hours around , but come early to get a spot on the patio because it fills up fast . <sssss> the green chili pot and sliders are worth checking out .
?		big fan of this place . <sssss> one of the best patios/places to day-drink in scottsdale . <sssss> we went friday night and ate at the bar and the food was great ! <sssss> minus 1 star for being an oregon ducks bar ; - p
?		like everyone else says the ambiance is very nice - for a restaurant in a strip mall . <sssss> but hey this is scottsdale . <sssss> the food was definitely above average and interesting - not just typical american thai food . <sssss> i 'd definitely like to go back to try some other dishes .
?		i honestly do n't know what it is about this place . <sssss> we stopped in for a drink and to catch some of the afc championship game and it was pretty dead , but the vibe was just weird . <sssss> pretty unfriendly , not welcoming idk - maybe its just not my kind of place .
?		carnage and chaos . <sssss> always a good time . <sssss> plenty of bar sports to keep you entertained , including billards , shuffleboard , and even ping-pong , which doubles as a beer-pong table . <sssss> and they have a stripper pole , good for watching people embarrass themselves -lrb- do n't be that guy ! <sssss> -rrb- .
?		i am pretty sure this place is the inner sanctum of hell . <sssss> first of all , what is the point of an `` appointment '' system if you have to wait 20 minutes past your appointment ? <sssss> second , who do you even check in with ? <sssss> the employees working were absolutely not making eye contact with anyone they were not helping . <sssss> when i finally flagged down a girl to ask that question , she gestured vaguely to the front of the store and told me `` jeremy '' . <sssss> how am i supposed to know that ? <sssss> there is no `` check in station '' or anything . <sssss> they need a board up on the wall that says `` now helping jane '' or some such system . <sssss> amazing that old school verizon has that system but hipster apple ca n't handle it ... third , i listened to 3 other customers get helped while i waited , and every single one was pitched a product . <sssss> i mean , sure , if it 's necessary , but c'mon : the poor guy next to me merely asked how to clean his screen and was sold a bottle of cleaner . <sssss> so the `` genius '' finally comes over and glances in my non-functioning charger port to tell me it 's corroded from water damage . <sssss> what ? <sssss> my phone has never been in water . <sssss> it 's never even been to the lake or near a pool . <sssss> so he takes it in the back to open it up -lrb- of course , i ca n't see it for myself ... no , no way -rrb- he comes back to insist it 's water damaged , and when i told him that was nearly impossible , he got very defensive and shoved another phone at me , telling me `` all i can do is sell you a new one for $ 149 . '' <sssss> mind , i 've had this phone for 15 months and it 's been nothing but glitches and a malfunctioning touch screen , and the lock button has n't worked since 3 months in . <sssss> so no way in hell am i purchasing another one . <sssss> worst experience in a retail store in a long time .
?		mom & pop , hole in the wall , call it what you will , but this place is delicious . <sssss> their sweetened raspberry iced tea is the best i 've ever had , perfect when running errands down mill on a hot day . <sssss> they brew each glass individually . <sssss> i used to go here specifically for the tea , and have fond memories of heading off to california armed with a large one in my cup holder ; -rrb- the cookies are definitely the kind my mom used to pull out on a cookie sheet , with a little bit of grease -lrb- you know what i mean , like leftover butter almost -rrb- on the bottom and fresh . <sssss> lots of flavors too . <sssss> they 're super generous with the portions - you will need a spoon to eat the ice cream sandwiches , there is literally a rounded full scoop of ice cream in each . <sssss> the owner is usually there , and 9/10 times is so super cheerful you ca n't help but smile . <sssss> he also thanks everyone for their business each time . <sssss> i finally decided to write a review because he was there today , and not only did he a -rrb- come out and chit chat while the girl was making my order , he b -rrb- asked twice if i wanted more ice in my tea since it was so hot out , and c -rrb- asked me if i was a student and gave me the discount . <sssss> not a big deal to most , but i 'm used to having to go `` hey , i 'm a student '' and be ` carded ' . <sssss> most places do n't want to give discounts , but he was more than happy to and did n't make me rummage for my sun card either .
?		much better this time around . <sssss> the gm , kari , sent us gift certificates after my negative review , with an apology . <sssss> we gave king 's a second chance on saturday night . <sssss> this time , we were seated in the bar area , which had a lot more pleasant atmosphere -lrb- less diner-y and loud , with a view through the bar window of the tempe marketplace fountain -rrb- . <sssss> our server , nicole , was much more attentive and pleasant than our last server . <sssss> she even brought bread out before we even ordered - yay ! <sssss> the food was greatly improved as well - we did n't order the same things , but usually if a place sucks , it sucks all the way around . <sssss> boyfriend did the captain 's platter -lrb- fried scallops and fish -rrb- and really liked it ; fried without the meat being overcooked , still juicy . <sssss> i did the seafood cobb salad , and it was really excellent - the shrimp were so flavorful and the salad was huge . <sssss> they did not skimp on any of the ingredients . <sssss> i 'd definitely get it again . <sssss> the bread pudding was ... different . <sssss> my other half really liked it -lrb- it 's drowning in jack daniels sauce , of course he did -rrb- but the texture was strange to me ; reminded me of french toast , it was mostly bread in sauce , not really `` pudding '' to me . <sssss> it was very good though . <sssss> i 'm glad to be able to re-write my review positively : -rrb-
?		i love sprinkles cupcakes . <sssss> i 've never had a problem with dryness or lack of flavor . <sssss> the red velvet is my absolute favorite , followed by lemon or peanut butter . <sssss> yummm ! <sssss> the counter girls are always smiling and friendly . <sssss> yes , the cupcakes are a little `` spendy '' at $ 3 - $ 4 per treat . <sssss> but anyone who 's had the pleasure of sampling sprinkles ' goodies before knows how rich they are , so in my opinion they 're not meant to be a daily snack . <sssss> therefore i do n't mind spending $ 3 or $ 4 on a rich , indulgent treat from time to time .
?		i 've been to chop shop a few times now , and while i appreciate a new , relatively inexpensive healthy place to grab a bite to eat , i 'm just not super impressed . <sssss> the first time i went i was n't very hungry and was hoping for a yummy juice or smoothie . <sssss> i do like how they offer cold pressed juices and am looking forward to trying one someday . <sssss> i picked a fruity smoothie i believe called the beach burn . <sssss> it was alright , but absolutely not worth $ 6 . <sssss> on my next visit i popped in for a quick bite before work . <sssss> they delivered my girl friend 's sandwich significantly before mine even though i ordered first , which was annoying but not the end of the world . <sssss> i had the chicken and prosciutto sandwich and my friend had the club . <sssss> both were good , just nothing to write home about in my opinion . <sssss> i 'll probably give chop shop one last try to find something i really like because as i mentioned it 's not too pricey and within walking distance of my work .
?		i will always have a soft spot in my heart for panchero 's as i am from iowa city , home of the original panchero 's location . <sssss> it is a staple in downtown iowa city nightlife ; there 's really nothing better than a ginormous messy burrito at 2am after a night of drinking . <sssss> i do n't visit this store as often as i should . <sssss> their burritos are far superior to chipotle in my opinion . <sssss> the fresh pressed tortillas are super yummy . <sssss> my go to burrito entails chicken , rice , queso -lrb- which carries an up charge but it is so worth it ! <sssss> -rrb- , cheese , sour cream , pico and mild sauce . <sssss> yes , this is my haven for feeding my inner fat kid ; -rrb- i think panchero 's is very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get . <sssss> today i got a burrito , small fountain drink , and a side of chips and guac for $ 12 and some change . <sssss> be warned - the burritos are massive ! <sssss> i dare you to eat the whole thing in one sitting .
?		if i was vegan , i would probably give this place 5 stars . <sssss> i usually come here if i have a vegetarian or vegan friend that i 'm trying to accommodate . <sssss> their tsoynamis are great and the brunch is also really good . <sssss> i do n't like that they stop serving food so early and only have baked goods -lrb- especially when green is closed ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> not very much seating but you are able to go over to green if it 's open . <sssss> i 'm not trying to put extra visits to green into my schedule , but i 'm not declining either .
?		i had the pleasure of doing beer school here with a few other friends . <sssss> the chef came out and presented each dish that was prepared with the beer . <sssss> every course was delicious , plentiful , creative , and it was so obvious that the chef cared a lot about his work . <sssss> we had : - french fries with truffle oil ketchup -lrb- amazing ! <sssss> -rrb- and mayonnaise - chicken with potatoes served with a puree that was made with the carcass of the chicken . <sssss> it was so rich and was reminiscent of a stew ; it was very much comfort food but the presentation was elegant and interesting . <sssss> - lamb served on top of herb spatzle . <sssss> fresh herbs had been cooked into the spatzle and then were also chopped and put on top . <sssss> - apple struedel for dessert ! <sssss> every course was paired so thoughtfully with the beer and it was overall a great experience . <sssss> i brought a few friends to praying monk and they loved it as well . <sssss> the owner of praying monk is also very passionate about beer and was incredibly warm and kind . <sssss> they definitely deserve your business !
?		how have i never reviewed short leash ? <sssss> i am so impressed with this food truck . <sssss> brad and kat are always friendly and gracious , even when lines are 40 people long and they 're running low on supplies . <sssss> i 've never had anything here that i did n't like . <sssss> i usually get a chicken dog and it does n't disappoint ! <sssss> get anything here . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> you wo n't regret it !
?		i loooove copper blues ! <sssss> they have tons of beers on tap and they frequently bring in local bands . <sssss> they really make efforts to keep things interesting here by participating in local events and all of the live music . <sssss> the food is decent and i love the huge windows on the patio -- it makes me feel like i 'm sitting outside .
?		i am so addicted to india oven that it 's embarassing . <sssss> i 've been known to come here at least once a week , and occasionally by myself if i ca n't drag anyone in with me . <sssss> eating alone at a buffet is not usually worth the shame , unless it 's here . <sssss> the staff is incredibly attentive and kind , and the owner is always fast to come over and ask you about your experience . <sssss> the inside is decorated beautifully and the ambiance is low key yet classy . <sssss> the lunch/dinner buffets have both mango lassi and chai tea , both of which i love . <sssss> their buffet is the cheapest i have seen -lrb- $ 7.95 / lunch , $ 9.95 / dinner -rrb- and also the best . <sssss> their tikka masala and spinach paneer are definitely my favorites , although they have a few rotating dishes that are also amazing . <sssss> lots of variety , always hot , and wonderful flavor . <sssss> closed on mondays , but otherwise , go give them a visit .
?		i walked in and bloc party was playing on the speakers . <sssss> this is a good sign , a very good sign . <sssss> i went there for a couchsurfing meet-up and it was a nice , intimate , and quiet space for us to chat . <sssss> the drinks are reasonably priced and i really like the atmosphere . <sssss> it 's dimly lit and slightly upscale . <sssss> parking can get complicated around happy hour , so there have been times when i have n't been able to go because of how busy it is . <sssss> it 's a nice , quiet place to relax and chat with friends . <sssss> i ca n't imagine going here for a wild night out or in the hopes of meeting someone new .
?		yesterday , i dined at the pita jungle . <sssss> i was thinking the place would have decor similar to rainforest cafe with a jungle type scene , but that was not the case . <sssss> it was a well maintained sit-down restaurant , but with more of a chill atmosphere . <sssss> i got the white meat chicken pita sandwich that came with onions , tomato , and cucumber sauce . <sssss> it was a great portion and just for $ 6.50 ! <sssss> i was very impressed , and i will have to come back and try something new !
?		upper wine pizza and bar has a very chill atmosphere and had delicious food . <sssss> i came here with a generous groupon . <sssss> the menu had a great mix of items from pizzas , wings , salads , sandwiches , and a whole lot more . <sssss> we were initially were heading for wine tasting , but we decided for a place that combined food and wine . <sssss> we got a chance to sample between 2 different pinot grigios , and the one we chose had a sweetness , but not as sweet as a riesling . <sssss> the wine went perfect with our bbq chicken pizza . <sssss> to start off , we got a caprese salad . <sssss> i could taste the authentically made cheese the server raved about . <sssss> i was very excited for our pizza , and it did not disappoint . <sssss> i really wish i had 2-3 stomachs because the pizza was heavenly , and they give you a lot of food . <sssss> i would say a small pizza is good for 2-3 people . <sssss> overall , we had a very pleasant experience .
?		one of the most disappointing things in the phoenix metropolitan is that restaurants close extremely early on weekdays . <sssss> that is not the case with ticoz . <sssss> i was driving around downtown phoenix looking for any place to eat after picking up my friend at a nearby hotel . <sssss> we found a quaint little place that was illuminated , and we decided to give it a shot . <sssss> when we came inside , it felt like we are at a lounge in hollywood . <sssss> there were not many people , but the few customers who were dining or drinking seemed to be having a great time . <sssss> we ordered a hummus appetizer and ordered some drinks . <sssss> i have not had a sangria since the wynn sunday champagne , and i decided to go with the watermelon sangria . <sssss> next thing you know , i ordered 2 more sangrias of different flavors . <sssss> it was absolutely amazing and the prices are pretty reasonable for drinks . <sssss> i had great service and felt like i have been a customer for years . <sssss> ticoz is a great find if you are wandering around for a cool place to chill in downtown phoenix .
?		this is the much classier and tastier version of your baja fresh and chipotle . <sssss> it seems that they really take interest in providing the fresh ingredients . <sssss> i have n't had this dish myself , but i heard the sweet pork is amazing . <sssss> i had a taco salad , and it was extremely flavorful . <sssss> i think the ambiance and where this costa vida is located gives it a clear sell that this means business !
?		i have been to a few games here at the us airways center . <sssss> what i like about the arena is that traffic and parking is a lot more structured than going to other stadiums that i have been to in the past . <sssss> the actual stadium has great seating . <sssss> there is really no bad seat in the house . <sssss> i think the structure of the stadium is not as tall as other basketball arenas , so even nose bleed seats are not too bad . <sssss> food is reasonably priced for a sporting event . <sssss> everyone has a lot of fun cheering on their home team . <sssss> after the game , there are several nearby bars to hang out afterwards .
?		taiko has to be one of the best japanese places i have been in the valley . <sssss> the menu has a lot more than just sushi . <sssss> sushi is amazing and great , but there is a lot more variety to japanese food than just sushi . <sssss> i got a chicken yakisoba which had a nice crisp sweet taste to it . <sssss> there were many variety of vegetables that brought a fresh taste to the yummy noodle dish . <sssss> the owner and servers are very family friendly , as my friend knows them all very well . <sssss> i asked my friend why she would not take out if she came so often here and lived very close . <sssss> she said part of the fun is hanging out with the people who work at the restaurant and getting some latest news from japan . <sssss> that unique factor makes this an actual experience than just eating simple food on your plate .
?		i have had some pretty good lebanese food in la , and i was expected mouth-watering flavors and the tangy flavors of the cuisine . <sssss> i think i set such high expectations , but the food was still good nonetheless . <sssss> i would have to say the hummus was delicious . <sssss> the price was pretty reasonable , but i think some of the other entrees could have been seasoned with more mediterranean flavors .
?		i have driven by us eggs several times on my way in or out of old town scottsdale . <sssss> us eggs has to have one of the tallest buildings i have ever seen for a restaurant . <sssss> one morning , i decided to give it a shot . <sssss> i did a little research on yelp , and i saw that people enjoyed the protein pancakes . <sssss> i eat quite a bit of protein supplements , so i was wondering if they somehow infused whey protein powder into the pancake batter . <sssss> it actually has fresh blueberries , cinnamon , and almonds . <sssss> i think the batter had whole grain wheat . <sssss> i decided to go with the half and half , which gave me 2 mini protein pancakes -lrb- humongous -rrb- and an idaho skillet that came with potatoes , your choice of 1 egg , and a type of sauce such as cajun spices , santa fe , or various other assortments . <sssss> each of my friends got the same dish , but with different skillet sauces . <sssss> we enjoyed the cajun , santa fe , and chicken avocado . <sssss> the best part of the experience is that you definitely get your money 's worth . <sssss> if you ever have a hard workout or are extremely hungry , come to us eggs for a power-packed breakfast .
?		la bocca is a classy pizza and wine bar restaurant located in the middle of mill ave. i came here with a friend from out of town . <sssss> earlier in the day we hiked south mountain and we walked around the dessert botanical gardens . <sssss> i do n't think she had enough food throughout the day , so she was famished when we got there . <sssss> i thought she was ready to pass out . <sssss> we skipped eating at a table and went straight to the bar . <sssss> i notified the bartender that my friend needed some bread right away . <sssss> she was very concerned and got us fresh bread with olive oil and basil . <sssss> i think this item actually cost money , but i did not see it on the bill . <sssss> throughout the night , she frequently checked up on us to see how we were doing . <sssss> my friend got the mushroom truffle pizza with goat cheese and spinach , and i got the garlic pizza . <sssss> we got the bottle of riesling , and it is half off bottles on sunday and monday . <sssss> in addition , you are not forced to finish it all as they recork it and pack it to go . <sssss> the decor had a very dark and intimate setting . <sssss> this would be a great place to take a girl on a date . <sssss> near the bar , they have black and white movies playing all night . <sssss> the bartender even told us that if we had a certain request , they would go out and find it and play it for the future . <sssss> this was a very pleasant and welcoming experience , and i will definitely visit again !
?		so i am here with a recommendation of am amazing chopped salad . <sssss> i did n't know my recommendation was to burger place ! <sssss> i do have to say it is more of finer dining place still . <sssss> i got the turkey grind to go with my salad . <sssss> i was wondering what the heck is a turkey grind ??? <sssss> it has to the best turkey burger patty i have ever had in my life ! <sssss> i guess i just give it 4 out of 5 until i try sometime more customary .
?		family business bagel shops are my favorite . <sssss> i found this place through groupon and decided to check it out . <sssss> the name itself intrigued me as lox means salmon fillet that is cured . <sssss> i did n't go with salmon , but i got a honey wheat bagel with veggie lite cream cheese . <sssss> the cream cheese was freshly made with carrots , garlic , and celery . <sssss> it had a light taste to go with a healthy and hearty sized bagel . <sssss> my friends got croissants with cheese which tasted delicious as well . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable here and you can order bagels by the dozen .
?		shame , no four peaks beer on tap when i was there ! <sssss> any decent tempe bar needs to carry at least kilt lifter ... this place is known for their wings , although if i 'm in the mood for wings i prefer native new yorker for their better customizable selections . <sssss> overall , it 's a good atmosphere if you 're looking to just chill with friends and have a good time or watch a sporting event on the tv .
?		i wish i lived/worked closer to this place because it is oh so good . <sssss> if you live in arizona , you got ta love fry bread . <sssss> and the fry bread house certainly delivers on those cravings . <sssss> my personal favorite is the dessert fry bread with honey and powdered sugar . <sssss> it 's super messy to eat and you should try not to inhale the powdered sugar , but man it 's one of my favorite things . <sssss> you can really select any toppings to go on the fry bread taco and it will be delicious . <sssss> i usually opt for beans and veggies . <sssss> make sure to go when you 're hungry because the servings are huge . <sssss> or share one with a friend .
?		this is a great spot for weekend brunch . <sssss> everything on the menu is a good option , i especially like their quiche . <sssss> their mimosas are also delightful . <sssss> it can get busy like any good brunch spot in scottsdale , so i recommend going on off hours . <sssss> we did have one experience with the valet service - there was a spot open right in front of the restaurant and so we parked there . <sssss> then we were chased down by the valet guy saying that we needed to give him our key in case he needed to move our car . <sssss> it was an open space that did n't say reserved for valet or anything ... i felt like we could have just left our car there since it was right in front of the restaurant .
?		such a great collection of asian restaurants ! <sssss> we always come to this area of town when we 're craving chinese food .
?		i think luke 's is just so-so . <sssss> a group of us chicago transplants at the office made the trek to luke 's for a nice friday lunch . <sssss> i did the combo sandwich and i was a bit surprised that for the price fries did not accompany the sandwich . <sssss> the giardinera -lrb- sp ?!?! <sssss> -rrb- was also nothing like i was used to , and frankly disappointing . <sssss> it was a bit greasy too . <sssss> imho , chicago gyros does a much better job .
?		this is far and away the closest thing that i 've found in phoenix that rivals the great hot dog/gyro places back home -lrb- windy city gyros in wrigleyville -lsb- on broadway just south of irving park rd since someone asked -rsb- -rrb- would be the gold standard-it almost brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it ... -rrb- . <sssss> the gyros are very good , with solid tzatziki and pita . <sssss> their italian beef is also quite good piled high with giardinera .
?		i 'll go generous on my 3.5 stars for leo 's . <sssss> the staff is super friendly and the restaurant is spotless . <sssss> i ordered the kalua pig plate lunch and found the rice to be , well , plain rice as it should be and the macaroni salad was also good and simple as it should be . <sssss> now , i 've had the real deal when visiting hawaii-whole hog lathered with salt and wrapped in banana leaves cooked in an imu -lrb- big hole in the ground -rrb- . <sssss> i think the county health dept. would take issue with that cooking method , so i 'm not going to fault leo 's for that : -rrb- but at least imho the pork needed more salt-it was tender with a hint of smoke but was underseasoned . <sssss> and kalua pig should make me retain water just lookin ' at it !! <sssss> my opinion , if you think l & l 's is too salty you might enjoy leo 's . <sssss> all in all i will return and try some of their other dishes .
?		i 've been here plenty of times since i moved to phoenix seven years ago , and i 've finally had a dish i was n't thrilled with-carnitas . <sssss> it was more like oven-roasted pork slices , not anything like i 'm used to . <sssss> but ... this is the first time in seven years i 've been disappointed . <sssss> their arroz con pollo is very good , carne asada , tacos , enchiladas , chimis , you name it-solid dumpy mexican place !! <sssss> i 've always been treated very well by the staff and never overcharged : -rrb-
?		what a cute place !! <sssss> that is about the only positive thing about aunt chilada 's , unfortunately . <sssss> the food is not even mediocre it sucks !! <sssss> started with the nearly inedible chips and the dressed-up-ketchup salsa all the way through dessert was downright misery ! <sssss> and the service sucks too : -lrb-
?		bah , this place has gone downhill imho . <sssss> i went to the promenade location for lunch this week craving some good corned beef and chicken noodle soup . <sssss> nine dollars for the combo plate -lrb- no drink as again they serve b.s. pepsi products -rrb- and i sat down only to be disappointed in the value , and the food was kinda blah if you ask me . <sssss> to their credit , my side of fries could not have been more perfect-hot , thin , crisp ... just like me lol : -rrb-
?		pita jungle is pretty decent i 've had their chicken shwarma plates every time i go . <sssss> it 's pretty college-neo hippie-veggie-art on the walls is for sale-type of place . <sssss> not to say that 's a negative , just a weird vibe for me personally . <sssss> haji baba is just down the street and personally that is more my speed and i think their hummus is better too .
?		um , so if you 're a stickler for sanitary methods of food preparation including the island where you get condiments , you might not like this place . <sssss> i do n't believe that there 's anything quite wrong with this place with that regard , but the fact that there is n't air conditioning does n't make me want to get a burger here in the middle of a phoenix summer for so many reasons . <sssss> that aside , the burgers are delicious . <sssss> i do n't like their fries and would probably skip those . <sssss> when i was here about 6 months ago they still did n't accept any form of payment besides cash . <sssss> they have a skeezy atm machine in the corner , but i 'd really rather not pay the 2-4 dollar fee for a 6-7 dollar burger . <sssss> it is good for burgers and i would n't recommend for anything else . <sssss> definitely appeals to red-meat loving men .
?		i 've experienced better , much better . <sssss> the prices are too high , the food is mediocre . <sssss> i went here once when i had a coupon and i would n't go back . <sssss> it smells bad inside , the food just was n't good and i was just thoroughly disappointed with the experience .
?		amazing food & the absolute best horchata that i 've ever had ! <sssss> the atmosphere is great including the paintings inside and new calavera they put outside . <sssss> the food is always fresh and there 's a variety of different salsas to choose from at the salsa bar . <sssss> great little place to have around the neighborhood , great addition . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		amazing is all i have to say about this place ... the end ! <sssss> okay , i have to rant on about this place , it 's delicious !! <sssss> i was looking for a location that served the best of the best for pizza and saw spinato 's come up . <sssss> the service here was exceptional and our waiter was soooo nice ! <sssss> we started off with a salad and i had the raspberry vinaigrette which was awesome . <sssss> we also had the medium thin crust pizza topped with extra cheese , spinach , and ham ... amazing !! <sssss> to end the meal we had to try the desserts so we shared a holy cannoli and brownie bella which both were mouth watering and a must have . <sssss> i will be going back to this place , although that wait was longer than expected and the waiting area was hot ! <sssss> it was all well worth the wait . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		located in the center of downtown , this place is a good place for some happy hour or good lunch ! <sssss> under new management they have taken some items off of their happy hour and lunch menu . <sssss> dinner here is amazingly delicious also ! <sssss> if you got for lunch or happy hour make sure to order their pomegranate mojito , it 's very tasty and will hit the spot after a long day ! <sssss> their sampler plate is huge and you can surely please everyone with sweet potato fries , crab dip , calamari ... etc. . <sssss> their lunch menu is good too , they have salads , very tasty quesadillas , and some sandwiches of your choice . <sssss> if you want to splurge and go for their dinner menu , i recommend for the appetizer their teriyaki tenderloins and buttermilk calamari . <sssss> for dinner i opted for a good old chophouse burger with sweet potato fries . <sssss> very juicy and cooked to perfection and goes great with brie cheese . <sssss> also for dinner if you 're more of a chicken person , the roasted chicken dijon is very good and the parmesan bread crust on top of it is to die for !
?		man i was very disappointed with my experience at big earl 's . <sssss> maybe i hit it on a bad night but the food was not good at all . <sssss> it might have been the saltiest bbq i think i have ever had . <sssss> my girlfriend and i left dinner with that weird salt feeling on the back of our tongues . <sssss> i got the brisket sliders and instead of strips of brisket it was diced up meat smothered in bbq and salt . <sssss> it almost felt like it was 2 day old brisket that they wanted to reuse so they diced it up and slapped it on a slider bun , they tasted it and said oh crap that is bland 2 day old brisket and poured salt on it . <sssss> meat was super greasy and the deep fried pickles were crazy salty as well . <sssss> i 'm giving them 2 stars because the fries were pretty good and they give you about 2 lbs .
?		i have been here for breakfast , lunch , dinner and it has not disapointed me yet ... awesome happy hour options & pricing with a friendly staff .
?		the food is always top notch and the so are the drinks . <sssss> come to think of it so is the vibe and the service , so i guess that makes it a no brainer . <sssss> it has some constants on the menu that are all good and everyday there is a new entree which has always been awesome . <sssss> go check it out , you wo n't regret it .
?		always my favorite coffee shop . <sssss> too bad the baristas remember my fiancé but not me , even though we always come in together . <sssss> pfft . <sssss> but that 's okay . <sssss> i can take solace in their georgia peach tea and gluten-free/vegan english muffin . <sssss> toasted with just the right preserves , it makes my belly happy . <sssss> i cheated on my diet but that 's okay . <sssss> just do n't tell my doctor . <sssss> i have always been a fan of their food . <sssss> i did knock this down to 4 stars because they seem to have dumped a lot of the vegan/gluten-free options they used to have . <sssss> super sad face . <sssss> also , there was a very loud man in there asking for money , yesterday . <sssss> but he quickly left . <sssss> loud conversation is very distracting . <sssss> it is not the quietest coffee shop if there are many people , but it is still nice !
?		i love thai . <sssss> it is usually gluten-free , and can easily be made vegetarian . <sssss> they finally got smaller tables and are more comfortable ! <sssss> the owners are always incredibly nice and love to make sure we enjoy our meals ! <sssss> thai e-san has superseded thairama as our favorite thai restaurant . <sssss> everything is delicious , and they are very accommodating to your needs !
?		they 're getting sloppy . <sssss> while i appreciate the novelty of vegan ice cream -lrb- which , most store bought brands are better -rrb- with various mix-ins , and vegan baked goods , there is a lot to complain about . <sssss> their facebook touts hot fudge sundays in which affogatos and hot fudge sundaes are $ 2 . <sssss> we went there and asked for a hot fudge sundae and were met with confusion by the barista who brought over the other girl who explained that they `` do not have sundaes but we can put hot fudge on an ice cream cup . '' <sssss> what ? <sssss> is that not a sundae ?! <sssss> did you not have this posted on your facebook as a special ? <sssss> they 're doing a poor job of making their staff aware . <sssss> additionally , the more i get tsoynamis , the more they 're screwed up . <sssss> they often will leave out ingredients or sometimes change them completely . <sssss> this is a very big deal because i am gluten-intolerant ... if i order a gf tsoynami , what is the risk they will add a non-gf ingredient and i wo n't notice until i ingest a bit ? <sssss> i do n't know ... maybe i am over the novelty , or maybe they 're just getting sloppy .
?		if you come here expecting good service , in the exact same fashion i 'd laugh at a crappy comedian . <sssss> the service is awful , they forget minor things all the time and give seemingly smart ass answers when you have questions . <sssss> me : `` what 's fritanga ? '' <sssss> her : `` it 's an omelette . '' <sssss> me : `` i know it 's a % $ # @in ' omelette as it says fritanga omelette . <sssss> but what is fritanga !? '' <sssss> or : me : `` can i get lime instead of lemon ? '' <sssss> her : `` it comes with it . '' <sssss> me : `` it says lemon comes with it . <sssss> i am asking for lime . '' <sssss> i think it might have to do more with comprehension than anything else . <sssss> i hope they do n't spit in my food . <sssss> however , the food is great . <sssss> i am giving it 3 stars due to horrible service . <sssss> at least it 's not really slow . <sssss> their beans are consistently delicious , and their red chile is the best in town . <sssss> i also really enjoy their chile relleno , but their salsas could use some work . <sssss> go to the one on 7th ave and grant . <sssss> it 's much better for some reason .
?		boba tea is my favorite addiction , and this is by far my favorite place in az to get it . <sssss> i travel from downtown phoenix regularly just to get my fix , and on my way i pass several other options that do n't even compare . <sssss> there are a lot of great flavors to choose from at the boba tea house , but i would suggest the standard `` boba tea with boba '' . <sssss> do n't be freaked out by the tapioca at the bottom . <sssss> it 's sort of an acquired taste , but once you get into it , it 's a beautiful and obsession .
?		let me start by saying , the outdoor patio could not be more pleasant . <sssss> the moment i sat down out there , i did n't want to leave . <sssss> i litereally could have stayed there all day . <sssss> although it 's a cool place overall , i found the inside to be not nearly as comfortable as the outside . <sssss> i took a star away because it was pretty pricey -lrb- most things on the menu were $ 8 or more -rrb- . <sssss> the food was good , but not good enough to warrant the high prices . <sssss> to me palatte is n't really appropriately named , as it 's more about the atmosphere than the food .
?		cool pizza , cool place . <sssss> the best thing about this place ? <sssss> it 's open on weekends and it 's open for dinner , so for that reason it has a special place in my heart . <sssss> that being said , the pizza 's not very good . <sssss> the sanwiches and pastas are pretty good , but then again , myabe i 'm trying to find something nice to say about this place because , did i mention ? <sssss> it 's open late and on weekends !
?		this restaurant is n't great , but it 's a really comfortable place to stuff your face with mostly standard mexican fare . <sssss> the service is usually very good . <sssss> overall , mi patio serves its purpose . <sssss> it 's a fun and friendly place to have a fattening and satisfying meal .
?		well i 'm glad that i had a heads up about the location . <sssss> it was a little difficult to find . <sssss> after taking my family on what seemed like a wild goose chase to find this gem , and after almost giving up , we found it . <sssss> we were seated inside and enjoyed the ecclectic surroundings while perusing the menu . <sssss> i had read some other reviews , so i ordered the veggie scramble with green chilies and a mimosa . <sssss> their coffee was delicious , the scramble was outstanding . <sssss> the service was great . <sssss> i loved the atmosphere . <sssss> i 'll be back to try something different .
?		i did n't know what to expect coming to a pizza place that has gotten rave reviews from people in arizona . <sssss> i did n't know what would come of a chain pizza restaurant . <sssss> was it going to satisfy my east coast palette ? <sssss> or was i going to be left to wallow in an endless craving for the perfect slice , set off once again by sub-par sauce , thick and chewy crusts , and a goop of who - knows - what - kind - of - over - processed - cheese beginning to line my arteries . <sssss> this is a different kind of pizza . <sssss> this is not the `` peasant pizza '' i am used to liking . <sssss> this is also not the gourmet type you would find at pizza picasso . <sssss> this is a kind of hybrid brand . <sssss> unlike the prius i rented on my most recent trip to new york , i liked it . <sssss> the sauce was tangy and ubiquitous . <sssss> the cheese was light and tasty . <sssss> most of all the crust impressed me with its slightly sweet taste , perfectly complimenting the sauce and cheese combination . <sssss> i also ordered a bowl of the soup of the day , which was tomato . <sssss> tasty . <sssss> i 'll be back , but not when i 'm craving a ny slice . <sssss> when i 'm feeling a little fancy , i 'll be back at sauce .
?		durant 's is my go - to place for special occassions . <sssss> i have many fond memories of sharing the `` porterhouse for two '' , which could be called the `` porterhouse for five '' in reality . <sssss> the towering strawberry shortcake is classic and their coffee is worth the drive by itself . <sssss> i love the decor . <sssss> the textured wallpaper is classic and seductive . <sssss> the food is indulgent . <sssss> last time i was there i had a spinach salad with my meal and it was out of this world . <sssss> if i could only do that to spinach in my own kitchen ...
?		i am a pizza snob . <sssss> i usually do n't like gourmet pizza . <sssss> i am a ray 's girl . <sssss> alas , i have been cutting most dairy out of my diet because of the harsh treatment of the animals . <sssss> low and behold , grimaldi 's . <sssss> while i will mention that the pizza i ordered totally rocked . <sssss> i ordered a plain personal white with garlic -lrb- and a side of sauce -rrb- . <sssss> great crust , the sauce was a little on the acidic side . <sssss> what i would like to give grimaldi 's the ultimate rating for is the fact that the mozzarella on the pizza is from happy grass-fed free-range cows . <sssss> i am beyond impressed that grimaldi 's cares enough about the happiness of the cows to use a more expensive cheese . <sssss> i can eat pizza again !
?		this place is chill . <sssss> we like to come here to chill . <sssss> service is great - they always have suggestions for patrons . <sssss> the atmosphere is cozy and eclectic . <sssss> the artwork ranges from interesting to what-the-hell-is-that ? <sssss> there are some nights where there is live music - i would n't suggest comig here to chit-chat on those nights . <sssss> come for the music .
?		food is excellent as always . <sssss> out of some of the wines too frequently . <sssss> ambiance is very good but stop taking my food and drink away until i am done ! <sssss> seems like they are rushing us out so they can pack more people in . <sssss> too bad .
?		we have enjoyed ted 's on many , many occasions over the years and continue to stop by when in the mood . <sssss> hot dogs are consistently above the norm . <sssss> there are other variations in the valley that are also very good but ted 's has its own unique flavor and texture . <sssss> prices are fair and the ambiance is `` old school . '' <sssss> do n't expect to be waited on but the staff is always courteous . <sssss> i like the all beef with mustard , onion and pickle . <sssss> how much more `` all american hot dog '' can you get ? <sssss> some places use gimmicks and bizarre hot dog creations to attract . <sssss> you wo n't find those at ted 's . <sssss> we enjoyed ted 's again this week and the reason i am not giving 5 stars is their onion rings seem to have become a bag full of little crunchy things lately . <sssss> years ago they were large , juicy rings with a tasty batter . <sssss> our recent experiences with them have been a little disappointing ... too many little crunchies . <sssss> we will continue to patronize when in the mood .
?		still get 5 stars . <sssss> went back again yesterday for some of that poutine . <sssss> glllrrrbbbl . <sssss> had a hard time coming up for air once i started eating . <sssss> susan had 6 perogies and enjoyed . <sssss> we love this place . <sssss> they are planning to move in january or february to a new location in mesa . <sssss> fortunately , they will be even closer to us : -rrb- we really need to take some of our kids there so they can sample some of this scandinavian/canadian cuisine . <sssss> not cheap , but you get what you pay for . <sssss> you ca n't find this stuff on denny 's menu -lrb- or any other local restaurant ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> beaver balls are next on my list to try .
?		i do n't know why it took us so long to hear about this place . <sssss> our lunch today was some of the best chinese food we have had in a long time . <sssss> the orange chicken and spicy chicken dumplings were superb !!! <sssss> i should n't say this , but they need to raise their prices . <sssss> this is probably the best deal in town as far as authentic chinese food goes . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back and try something else .
?		my fiance and i go here all the time before d-backs and suns games . <sssss> this place is pretty casual and is great for happy hour drinks . <sssss> the building is beautiful and its nice to go to a place with a little character . <sssss> meal : i typically stick with the hamburgers . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with them . <sssss> i also encourage patrons to try their beer mixtures . <sssss> it is n't always available but a guinness mixed with peach beer is a spectacular way to cool off during the summer . <sssss> taste : i always try a new dish when i visit rose and crown and i have never been disappointed . <sssss> this is n't the fanciest meal around and may not be the best in town , but i do n't think there is a bad dish on the menu . <sssss> 8 out of 10 . <sssss> value : the prices are more than fair and reasonable . <sssss> they do n't seem to be stingy with the portions and if i was n't going to a ball game afterwards , i would need to get a to-go bag . <sssss> 5 out of 5 . <sssss> service/cleanliness : this is the one thing that hurts rose and crown . <sssss> the servers are always really nice and know the menu . <sssss> but their attentiveness really lacks . <sssss> almost every visit is riddled with servers failing to re-fill glasses or bringing out meals in a timely manner . <sssss> they are always quick to apologize but it still sucks waiting 10 minutes for a server to ask you if you want another beer , right ? <sssss> 6 out of 10 . <sssss> atmosphere : the place has character , good music , and for some reason , my fiance and i always end up chatting with other patrons and/or servers . <sssss> the building is pretty in its own funky way , parking is n't that bad , and the outside patio is great during the spring and fall . <sssss> in all , its a fun place to get a beer and a bite to eat . <sssss> 5 out of 5 . <sssss> overall : there are a bunch of places to grab a dinner and beer before a ball game , but from my experience , rose and crown is the best place to go . <sssss> heck , i even like coming here after a game . <sssss> if the service was better , i would even come here when there is n't a game . <sssss> i have yet to go here just for a meal or a drink , but if i lived closer , i think this would be an awesome place to make a `` regular joint '' . <sssss> 24 out of 30 points , 4 out of 5 stars .
?		meehhhhhhhhhh . <sssss> its a step above cafeteria food . <sssss> its not bad . <sssss> its not offensive ... its just meehhhhh . <sssss> meh . <sssss> meal : the fiance got a europa sandwich -lrb- veggie sandwich -rrb- and i got the meatball sub . <sssss> i also got a mexican mule to go along with the meal . <sssss> taste : boring . <sssss> its not that it tasted bad , its that it had lacked any real flavor . <sssss> it was like the chef was aiming not to please but to have the most generically and widely acceptable sandwich . <sssss> the mexican mule was ok ; it was my second choice for a drink as the bar ran out of bitters for the first choice of drink . <sssss> what bar runs out of bitters ? <sssss> anyways , i can only describe the food as paper mache with a small pinch of salt . <sssss> why does organic , hippy food got ta taste so boring ? <sssss> 6 out of 10 . <sssss> value : meeeeeh . <sssss> meh , meh , mehhhhhhhhh . <sssss> average value ... i am running out of descriptions for mediocrity . <sssss> mehhhhhh . <sssss> 3 out of 5 . <sssss> service/cleanliness : service was slow . <sssss> it was busy , that i understand , but it took forever to order , to get our meal , to get our check ... meh . <sssss> 7 out of 10 . <sssss> atmosphere : they had a jazz band playing , which was nice . <sssss> i hate to say it though , the band was meh . <sssss> it was slightly off beat and mediocre intonation . <sssss> mehhhhhh . <sssss> 3 out of 5 . <sssss> overall : i recommend walking a block down and going to jobot . <sssss> if you want a drink and/or listen to live music , go to lost leaf , which is 3 houses or so from jobot . <sssss> 19 out of 30 points , 2 out of 5 stars . <sssss> meh .
?		my fiance and i meet up some friends here before heading to the eddie vedder concert on 04 november 2012 . <sssss> meal : between the four people at dinner , we had the kentucky fried quail , kobe beef short ribs , seasonal daily shortbread -lrb- could n't remember exactly what it was -rrb- , vintner ' salad , collard greens , tatter tots , and the mac n ' cheese . <sssss> oh , and we had a ton of cocktails . <sssss> i think every person at the table had at least 3 drinks each . <sssss> taste : real hit or miss . <sssss> somethings were just off the charts in taste and freshness and some things were incredibly boring . <sssss> the cocktails were wonderful and it was apparent they use top shelf stuff . <sssss> the mac n ' cheese was a real let down . <sssss> the collard greens were decent at best . <sssss> the quail was good but nothing to write home to momma about . <sssss> the beef short ribs were top notch , along with the short bread . <sssss> i would think the way to go is to go with whatever is the `` daily special '' . <sssss> 7 out of 10 . <sssss> value : value was horrible . <sssss> i understand that the intent of nicer restaurants is that they do n't typically serve huge portions , but at the same time , if you drop $ 150 -lrb- without tip -rrb- , you expect to be full afterwards . <sssss> do n't come hungry because you will leave hungry . <sssss> the best value was probably the short ribs . <sssss> 1 out of 5 . <sssss> service/cleanliness : i liked the service because our server knew that menu inside and out ... and she was not shy about giving us recommendations . <sssss> i like a server whois n't afraid to share their opinion and directs you away from a potentially bad dish or experience . <sssss> out server was attentive , funny , and friendly , but at times as a little pushy . <sssss> 9 out of 10 . <sssss> atmosphere : this is a great atmosphere . <sssss> it overlooks the city-scape and architecture design is beautiful . <sssss> it has a very young yet sophisticated feel to it , but almost any age demographic will fit in . <sssss> 5 out of 5 . <sssss> overall : next time i come here , i would probably just come for the drinks and get a small appetizer instead of a full meal . <sssss> the atmosphere , drinks , and service is what really makes this place stand out . <sssss> i think this would be a great place to meet someone for a date or if you want to go somewhere upscale prior to a concert near by . <sssss> 22 out of 30 points , 3 out of 5 stars .
?		this is the legitest bagel joint in tempe ... lox and bagel all the way baby .
?		four peaks baby . <sssss> this spot is awesome . <sssss> great place to meet up with a crowd , grub , and pound some craft brew . <sssss> the food is great : dope appetizers , rockin ' burgers , decent pizza , and daily specials . <sssss> the beer is fantastic , hop knot being my fave . <sssss> they have happy hour everday from 3-7 and 10-close with dollar off beers , a light night menu , tv 's , and a pool table . <sssss> i 've gotten mashed here more than a few times . <sssss> sunday brunch is killer , and may i suggest you try the stout milkshake , a little known secret , but good for the sweet toof . <sssss> do n't miss out on the peaks .
?		this is the breakfast spot in tempe ! <sssss> bomb huevos rancheros , killin ' biscuits and gravy , fatty omelets , what more do you need ? <sssss> a no frills old school breakfast stop . <sssss> did i mention that the place is staffed by some very attractive women , cause that 's a plus in my book . <sssss> this is the sunday morning hangover stop .
?		can you say schnitzel ? <sssss> i love the haus murphy 's . <sssss> their newer location is bigger , so dinning with a group is a breeze now . <sssss> the food is awesome . <sssss> the sausage is top notch , the sausage platter is obtuse . <sssss> i 'm a schnitzel addict , so i always entertain one when i visit . <sssss> the bread pudding is fantastic , but as is all the dessertery . <sssss> it 's a german place and the one pasta dish they have there is even killing . <sssss> it 's a bit expensive , but worth it in every way . <sssss> for the drinkers , it 's a little bit of heaven . <sssss> they always have about 5 german beers on tap usually franziskaner weissbier , warsteiner dunkel , spaten optimator , a weistephaner , and a pilsner of german origin . <sssss> i used to hit up the happy hour here on a reg and deplete them on mustard and pretzels . <sssss> they also serve beers in the huge mugs if you 're a drunk or just like big things .
?		hail the pasty . <sssss> this place rocks so much i ca n't even put it into words . <sssss> it is definitely one of the places in the entire valley that i recommend to travelers . <sssss> everything is made right there , in front of you almost . <sssss> their selection is vast and pretty much everything is awesome ... i suggest the reuben . <sssss> desserts are good , check out the banofee pie . <sssss> hoegaarden on tap plus others , and the kicker $ 3 car bombs all day everyday . <sssss> we have a winner . <sssss> this spot is legit !
?		i 'm sorry , i hate to be a downer , but this place is terrible !!! <sssss> i work in tempe and was sooo excited when a new nice looking place opened on mill ave. for all of those of you who 've spent time on mill , you know it is somewhat lacking in the area of fine dining , or even fair dining for that matter . <sssss> anyways , we went there pretty consistently for a while after it opened , mainly because it was new and we were all deathly tired of the same things for lunch every day , and it started off alright . <sssss> alright is literally the best compliment i could give this place . <sssss> the pizzas and salads were okay , the sandwiches pretty gnarly to be honest , and it was all incredibly overpriced . <sssss> that said , we are a fickle bunch so `` alright '' worked for us for a few months . <sssss> that is until la bocca took a huge slide downwards . <sssss> all of a sudden our lunches , that solely consisted of salad and pizza started taking a full hour and a half to get through ! <sssss> how it takes 90 minutes to shell out a couple of salads and pizzas i will never understand . <sssss> as more time passed , our orders were consistently screwed up , the wait staff was terrible , never refilling water/soft drinks or even bothering to come over and explain why after 60 minutes , none of our food had come out ! <sssss> after several consecutive trips of service like that , we crossed la bocca off of our list for good . <sssss> it was a bummer . <sssss> i had very high hopes for what looked like a cute little pizza/wine bar/cafe at first . <sssss> but spending almost $ 20 at lunch for a salad and pizza that take over an hour when you 're one of 12 people in the restaurant ? <sssss> no thanks ...
?		i promise i will keep this one short and sweet because there is n't possibly anything further i could say about this fabulous little bistro that has n't been said already . <sssss> anyhow , i just moved to midtown , do n't know a soul within 30 minutes , but by some shred of dumb luck happen to be in walking distance of fez . <sssss> many times have i come in by myself to grab some food or a drink at the bar for no reason other than to get out of my place , and the staff and patrons have always been lovely and welcoming . <sssss> never did i feel awkward for coming in by myself , which was very refreshing . <sssss> at this point i 've worked my way through about half the menu , and it 's all quite good . <sssss> they seem to always have the perfect dish depending on how hungry i am , not too mention some killer cocktails and an always bumping happy hour . <sssss> simply can not wait for my friends to come visit so i can show them my fabulous neighborhood bar ... how lucky am i ?!?
?		i have trust issues . <sssss> i have as far back as i can remember . <sssss> when i first read about the light rail coming all those years ago and everyone was hyping it like it was the 2nd coming , i did n't buy it . <sssss> i wanted to , but i could n't . <sssss> i have always been a firm believer in the `` if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is '' mentality . <sssss> even after i moved to midtown from n scottsdale specifically for the downtown community combined with the light rail just a short while ago , i still was n't sure it was going to work out . <sssss> a nice idea , but just may not take . <sssss> -lrb- i have issues , i know : -rrb- -rrb- but then came wednesday night . <sssss> wednesday night consisted of a little mini happy hour followed by the suns game . <sssss> at that was it . <sssss> trust issues out the freakin ' window the light rail is the shit !!!!!!! <sssss> i could n't believe what a geek i turned into . <sssss> i felt like a 6 year old at disneyworld for the first time . <sssss> i finally understood what all the fuss was about . <sssss> the cars are clean , comfy , and everyone else on there is just as geeked out as you are ! <sssss> and i ca n't explain the incredible feeling of knowing that my car was nowhere in my general vicinity . <sssss> i was n't going to be stuck in my parking structure for 40 minutes after the game . <sssss> i was n't going to be followed the entire way home by sherriff joe 's personal motorcycle stalkers . <sssss> and it felt really freaking good . <sssss> to all the skeptics out there like me , give it up . <sssss> do n't waste your time . <sssss> just surrender to the inevitability that the light rail truly is a driving force behind the resurgence of the valley . <sssss> you 'll be glad you did . <sssss> go find your own version of disneyworld ... : -rrb-
?		oh . <sssss> my . <sssss> god . <sssss> how have i never been to lo-lo 's chicken and waffles after 8 years in the valley ? <sssss> shame on all of my friends for waiting so long to take me to this hidden gem !! <sssss> think fried chicken with your breakfast of waffles , eggs , and cheese grits sounds gross ? <sssss> well you have never been more wrong my friend ! <sssss> i do n't quite know how , but it was oh so right . <sssss> and i am not a big meat with my eggs fan -lrb- i.e. steak and eggs -rrb- fan in general so no one was more surprised than me when i was left craving some more of that delicious fried perfection after brad e was kind enough to share some of his with me . <sssss> the waffles are dusted with cinnamon and melt in your mouth . <sssss> the cheese grits are wonderfully authentic to a southern girl such as myself , and let 's be honest , who in their right mind would ever complain about a freakin ' mason jar filled to the brim with delicious kool-aid . <sssss> i ordered way too much food for myself -lrb- shocker -rrb- so i did n't even get to sample the mac and cheese , corn , and other incredibly enticing side dishes that were scattered about my table . <sssss> yes , the place is kind of cramped and you 'll wait longer than you want for your food , but deal with it , you 'll be thrilled you did .
?		this place was disgusting , and of course by disgusting i mean awesome . <sssss> and i suppose i also mean disgusting , because lets face it , pomeroy 's is not intended for the faint of heart . <sssss> a group of us came pummeling on saturday night after amber w. and the second time ever boys were kind enough to give us a sunnyslope art walk preview -lrb- which kicked ass by the way -rrb- and immediately i was hooked . <sssss> $ 2.75 amber bocks all day and a late night menu with grilled cheeses , chicken fingers , and mozzarella sticks ? <sssss> where do i sign up ? <sssss> like seriously , that is my holy trifecta of late night bar food , and this particular bar food was delicious . <sssss> and i can say that with great confidence because believe it or not , i was n't drunk , so i could actually taste it : -rrb- be prepared to wait though , because the service for certain members of our party -lrb- sorry jordan -rrb- was slow . <sssss> yes , the table was filthy and no one once came over to clean it . <sssss> yes , the clientele was a bit on the unwashed side . <sssss> and yes , there were at least 5 people in there that wanted to kill me for no other reason that i made the mistake of walking in with a designer bag . <sssss> but listen , pomeroys make 's zero excuses for itself , and really , what self-respecting dive bar should ? <sssss> that said , before my next visit to pomeroys , i will dirty myself up a bit and dress in the finest wife beater i own , and it will be on , because no amount of salty bar patrons will stand between me and my $ 2.75 amber bocks , so do n't even try ...
?		i have been searching far and wide for a decent pizza/salad place i could get to on my lunch break for , oh , two years now . <sssss> fuck decent , this shit is delicious !! <sssss> thanks to the lovely sunny b. 's review on the spinato 's in central phoenix , i decided to do a little digging and see if they had one anywhere near tempe . <sssss> and that is when i found this total hole-in-the-wall little shack of heaven a block away from tempe marketplace . <sssss> i know we 've all been taught not to judge a book my its cover , so seriously , do not let the meager building scare you away as there is a serious gem hidden inside . <sssss> chicago style thin crust pizza , oven baked to a perfect crisp . <sssss> heavy on the tomato sauce just like i like it , and a heaping house salad served almost immediately after ordering it . <sssss> and they also have a bunch of gluten-free options for you unlucky celiac sufferers out there . <sssss> i am in love . <sssss> i will certainly be back . <sssss> after they get their liquor license , i might never leave .
?		i love the vig . <sssss> good ole dependable vig . <sssss> great patio , kick ass happy hour specials , and bocce ball . <sssss> what more could you really ask for ? <sssss> that 's right , stella on tap , and yes , they have that too . <sssss> i 've heard their whole menu is good , but since i can not get past their trifecta -lrb- sliders -rrb- or their chicken fingers , i can not comment . <sssss> but man oh man are the sliders and fingers bomb . <sssss> i ca n't quite put my finger on it , but there 's something very relaxing about the vig for me . <sssss> maybe it 's their trumpet player that 's there on tuesday and wednesday nights who 's playing is intoxicating by the way . <sssss> or maybe it 's knowing that i can drink until i can no longer see and george and the vig rig will make sure i get home safely free of charge , just a kick ass service that the vig provides -lrb- tips always appreciated of course . <sssss> -rrb- the only thing keeping this from being a 5 star place for me is the simple fact that their cocktails are priced a bit higher than reasonable . <sssss> if i 'm paying $ 8 for a ketel soda , i expect it to be tall and poured with a heavy hand , which these i 'm sad to report are not . <sssss> i will however continue being a faithful patron of the vig for all the reasons listed above , and you should too .
?		atmosphere and decor are pretty basic and may fall short for some , but the food more than makes up for it . <sssss> portion sizes are generous and food always satisfies . <sssss> great place to go when your tired of the usual . <sssss> soda is sold by the can , just fyi .
?		this place is always hopping , the biggest challenge often is finding seating for you and your friends . <sssss> store is always clean and i 'm always amazed how little my creations cost . <sssss> there is alwasy an occassion to visit .
?		just had one of the best meals of the year ! <sssss> everything was delicious ; from the starter bread to the last bite . <sssss> the side of coleslaw was absolutely perfect , and would 've been a better meal than most places by itself . <sssss> lump crab - amazing , caesar salad - fresh and crisp . <sssss> main course was everything we were hoping for and some . <sssss> service was a delight and the atmosphere was alive and well , without being too loud . <sssss> ca n't wait til our next visit .
?		better than fair trade , not quite as good as cartel - though royal 's location and hours are better , and the seating area is more conducive to random people interactions , which i like : -rrb-

?		i have been here probably five times , but not for awhile . <sssss> the only reason for that is that , by the time i 'm ready to get breakfast , i 'm pretty hungry and ca n't stand waiting 30 minutes to an hour to get in . <sssss> last sunday , i actually packed a snack and sat on the curb to face 45 long , hard minutes of being tantalized by delicious smelling food . <sssss> i had forgotten just how great this place is . <sssss> the service is super friendly and very efficient . <sssss> once you get in , you get served very quickly . <sssss> i could swear that they laid down our enormous spread of food within 5 minutes of us ordering , and it 's not old , sitting-around-under-a-heat-lamp stuff , it 's hot and fresh . <sssss> i got some eggs -lrb- fresh and cooked to perfection -rrb- , and wheat toast which was thick cut and had some delicious local strawberry preserves with it , but the standout is always the hashbrowns . <sssss> they are the stuff of dreams : a giant , salty , crisp on the outside/soft on the inside , just greasy enough slab of heaven . <sssss> sweet pea got his usual hog n chick that comes with the thickest , most peppery bacon i 've ever seen . <sssss> and then we split a waffle , also delicious -lrb- not as outstanding as the rest , but i 'm not usually a waffle person . <sssss> -rrb- if you want the real deal , a straight-up breakfast - no frills and newfangled foods , but just really quality delicious stuff , then pack a snack and get to matt 's . <sssss> nobody does it better .
?		wow , after my third visit to the herb box for lunch today , this one is really teetering between 4 and 5 stars . <sssss> i love , love , love this place for lunch -lrb- which coincidentally is the only time i 've been here , but i suspect that if i went for dinner , brunch , or happy hour , i might love it too as the menu appears to be largely the same . <sssss> -rrb- i 've now tried the grow happy salad , the vegan nosh , and the butternut enchiladas , and all were really delicious , but the vegan nosh and butternut enchiladas are what i would call ... special ... above and beyond your usual lunch fare . <sssss> vegan nosh also has the presentation going for it with 4 different salads in 4 bowls on a wooden slab . <sssss> when i order it , people have a tendency to go `` wow , that 's a lot of food '' and yeah , it is , but it 's probably the same amount of food as a large salad -lrb- and twice as delicious -rrb- . <sssss> this is not the cheapest place , but it is pretty , the food is pretty , and the food is delicious . <sssss> it 's in my rotation for sure .
?		ok so i 've been putting off coming here because 1 -rrb- sweet pea and i were not fans of palatte - i know , i know , it was great blah blah blah - did n't get it and 2 -rrb- `` local breeze '' sounds like some place where they wear hawaiian shirts and serve smoothies . <sssss> but , it was such a nice morning for a walk , and i just do n't have the kind of time it takes to commit to matt 's . <sssss> the ambiance is pretty much the same as palatte , sweet pea calls it `` you have a big backyard and invited everyone over for breakfast '' kinda vibe , and i agree . <sssss> two big improvements are the addition of what looks to be a sizeable bar and sit-down service rather than order at the counter . <sssss> the music was a little random , but at least it was n't the steel drum stuff i was expecting by the name . <sssss> we were greeted quickly and served water promptly . <sssss> it was a nice day , and we sat outside . <sssss> the menu is limited , but enough of the breakfast standards . <sssss> i ordered 2 eggs over easy , the `` spicy '' cottage cheese , a side of the potatoes , and the whole wheat toast with an iced tea . <sssss> sweet pea got the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and a side of sausage . <sssss> they came out quickly and were large portions . <sssss> he said he liked but did n't love the biscuits and the bacon , but he did seem to eat quite a bit . <sssss> they told him it was spicy , and he said it had some spice but was n't overpowering . <sssss> the highlights of my meal were the potatoes and the toast . <sssss> they say the bread is baked in house , and it was thick and definitely had a homemade flavor . <sssss> the potatoes were skillet-type potatoes with peppers and onions and were very good although cold . <sssss> the cottage cheese was odd - not spicy per se , but had some sort of odd flavor that i could n't put my finger on . <sssss> it definitely had some pepper and chives in there , but perhaps a pinch of cayenne ? <sssss> anyway , not really an improvement over regular cottage cheese in my book . <sssss> one bizarre thing - the menu says that they give 10 % discount if you ride your bike there . <sssss> we asked if we got it since we walked , and the waitress said no , with the reason that `` a lot of neighborhood people walk here all of the time , and so if we did that , it would be pretty much everyone getting 10 % off . '' <sssss> ok ... so you 're discriminating against locals and pedestrians ? <sssss> you heart cyclists ? <sssss> what 's the reason for the discount in the first place , because it 's obviously not environmental ... ? <sssss> weirdness . <sssss> but the place is solid , and i 'll be back . <sssss> probably for cocktails next .
?		hands down the best chinese seafood buffet - salt and pepper shrimp and kalbi short ribs
?		opening week friday probably not the best time to go , but had to go to portillo 's . <sssss> the line from the door outside must have been 50 ft which did not include from the door to the counter . <sssss> so we went to the drive thru which took about 12 minutes thanks to the staff . <sssss> food came out quickly and lived up to the hype . <sssss> italian beef was very good , the sausage sandwich was very generous and had to get a hot dog to split and try a piece of each . <sssss> tried the chocolate cake shake and fries which were all tasty . <sssss> will be back to try other items . <sssss> one thing is when ordering , have all the items with everything the way it is suppose to be .
?		nice small size mall
?		drove by this location watching it being built many times thinking another burger place , do we really need another burger restaurant ? <sssss> yes since it is close to home and great quality . <sssss> tried going there last saturday and the line into the restaurant was out the door , so we decided to come back another day . <sssss> wide selection of burgers including bison which i will try next time , had the llano poblano burger with a fried egg which was prepared well and very juicy with truffle fries which were very good . <sssss> the true test were my kids thought this was one of the better burgers that they have had . <sssss> location is very accessible with plenty of parking and the ambiance is very nice , with of course a bar , very modern decor and tv monitors that add to the atmosphere but does not make it a sports bar . <sssss> plenty of outside seating for the current awesome night dining . <sssss> service was good but the waiter really does not need to do anything as they have a self serve drink dispenser . <sssss> will go back to try the other burgers and encourage anyone to try this new resatauant .
?		very pleased with the food quality and quantity with very resonable prices . <sssss> had the ny strip steak w white truffle mac & cheese and my wife had the grilled salmon blackberry glazed which both were well prepared . <sssss> service was prompt and always met our needs , would have rather sat toward the back then against the front window . <sssss> restaurant has good ambiance and is decorated nicely considering it is in a strip mall . <sssss> was one of the more enjoyable meals that i have had for sometime .
?		one of our favorite places for burgers . <sssss> breakfast burger with fried egg an bacon is so good
?		best place to buy shoes
?		good place for lunch awesome atmosphere ... by lunch i mean anytime but summer since there is limited room inside ...
?		this is a place i usually like to go since you can find some areas where dialogues are possible -lrb- i.e. the noise level is low in some spots -rrb- . <sssss> although it is a bit pricey , i enjoy being able to lounge a little either upstairs or downstairs .
?		i am not a huge fan of zoos but they have done a good job in keeping a friendly environment for both parties -lrb- the animals , and the human animals -rrb- : -rrb- ...
?		cool building , great beer list , cool set up . <sssss> i 'll be back .
?		awesome beer selection . <sssss> food was pretty good too . <sssss> something like 32 beers on tap . <sssss> will go again .
?		they fix your tires .
?		this is thee local spot for mid sized nationally touring acts ! <sssss> it 's clean -lrb- a rarity in it 's genre -rrb- and the sound and sight lines are great . <sssss> it 's an old theater with the seats taken out so you can get as close as you want -lrb- always general admission -rrb- . <sssss> as of late they have been insanely anal about security at the door -lrb- you must take off your shoes !?!? <sssss> -rrb- but other than that it 's by far the best place to see a band in phoenix ! <sssss> they now are charging $ 5 for parking -lrb- and have taken over public parking areas -rrb- ... now for big shows you have to walk a mile across the bridge to get in ... it really is a pain in the ass -lrb- combined with the door screening -rrb- ... so i 'm downgrading this venue from a 5 star ... although they must know the set time -lrb- it 's in the contracts -rrb- ... they refuse to tell you them ... in hopes that you spend more time here waiting and drinking -lrb- i.e. more money from their captive audience . <sssss> total assholes to their own customers ... now i 've downgraded to a one star !
?		dog friendly ! <sssss> awesome coffee ! <sssss> very cool hangout !!! <sssss> park nearby to walk the dog !
?		fresh local meat ! <sssss> good stuff and good prices !! <sssss> i love this place !
?		i so wanted to fall in love with centurion , unfortunately based upon this one visit for breakfast i just did n't feel it . <sssss> the place itself is cute and quaint with a couple of really nice couches and tables outside on the patio . <sssss> i had the eggs benedict and it was just okay . <sssss> granted eggs benedict is an extremely difficult item to produce so i 'm not sure this one dish should be taken as a blanket review . <sssss> but it was pretty bland and it was loaded with some green leafy things -lrb- not found on your typical eb -rrb- that i scraped off . <sssss> i 'll be going back and making revisions as needed ...
?		the same pizza as pizza bianco but with no wait and plenty of seating . <sssss> i always get the margrita pizza which is out of this world -lrb- with a very smokey taste -rrb- . <sssss> mexico cokes and community seating -lrb- as well as a bar to `` belly up to '' -rrb- .
?		this place is beautiful , and considering the owners i expected nothing less ... that said ... where the hell is the candy ? <sssss> i 'd say about 80-90 % of the candy is readily available at your local circle k ... so i 'm not sure i really get what 's going on here ... let 's hope they get more hard to find jems in the future ...
?		just a really nice , quite and laid back coffee shop . <sssss> not to `` trendy-ass-kissin ' '' ... just a nice place to kick back and/or get some work done . <sssss> yes of course they have free wi-fi . <sssss> they are very dog friendly , and even supply a nice big water bowl -lrb- and treats -rrb- for your dog !
?		this is a preview review . <sssss> i just so happened to walked by 2 hours after jobot opened . <sssss> the building itself has gone through a complete overhaul -lrb- since hoodride vacated -rrb- and it 's beautiful . <sssss> there is a big looong bar lined with bar stools so you can `` belly up '' while you wait for your drinks . <sssss> there will be an entire room built later but for now the stools work just fine . <sssss> there was wi-fi but no stereo -lrb- which i presume will be installed soon enough -rrb- . <sssss> equally so far -lrb- there is another room yet to open -rrb- it 's not all that laptop friendly -lrb- few outlets -rrb- . <sssss> jobot is owned/run by john who owned/ran conspire coffee just down the street so it 's the same great coffee .
?		the place is really nice , my tenderloin was small but really good . <sssss> i liked it , you would to -lrb- if you like really nice kinda fancy places -rrb- ... but i do n't know ... i guess it 's the kind of place that married men take their girlfriends . <sssss> or the place you take your wife -lrb- the one you still like -rrb- the day after her mom died . <sssss> or in my case ... if you just want to feel like the second youngest person in the room -lrb- my date jacqui j won first place , hands down -rrb- . <sssss> nothing is wrong with this place , it 's just ... well it 's not bar food and there was no jukebox with johnny cash in it . <sssss> not only that , when i asked for a can of blatz they looked at my like i was an alien . <sssss> and not a spork in the house ! <sssss> and get this , they took cloth and made it into napkins ! <sssss> weird stuff ! <sssss> but seriously ... the place is cozy -lrb- almost to much -rrb- ... the food is in small portions -lrb- at least mine was -rrb- and kinda pricy . <sssss> it was just what i expected . <sssss> no more , no less . <sssss> a solid 4 no doubt . <sssss> and any restaurant that tries to make a go of it on 7th freeway/street ... god bless 'em !
?		from the people who brought us the emerald lounge ... it 's the ruby room ! <sssss> what a beautiful place stuck in the middle of nowhere -lrb- just south of downtown -rrb- ! <sssss> i arrived at 9:45 pm on thursday night and the place was completely empty with the only exception being the bartender and dj ... ... at any rate the walls were set with local art work and the place has so much potential -lrb- if you had ever been to the emerald lounge you know what i mean -rrb- ... fingers crossed that more people catch on to this potentially very cool as hangout and live music and art venue !
?		nice place -lrb- the inside is better than what the outside would imply -rrb- ... very clean ... pino the owner -lrb- from italy -rrb- seems like he 's always there and knows his customers ... and comes off as a real nice guy ... but saddly i found that my pepperoni pizza had virtually zero flavor ... the pizza looked great ... the crust was fine ... but i 'm totally into sauce and there was no flavor to it ... bummer ... still have yet to find great pizza in phx : -lrb-
?		great place ... great food . <sssss> that atmosphere is sooooo nice ... coffee 's great and free wi-fi ! <sssss> seems like the owner and his wife are always there and they want you to enjoy your experience . <sssss> the outdoor patio is facing 7th street so regretfully it 's like sit along side a freeway . <sssss> also they only have 7 parking spots in their very small lot . <sssss> but still a really nice addition to downtown .
?		well they have re-upped the outside bar , added a `` corn hole '' area -lrb- i ca n't believe people call it that -rrb- and it 's super super nice , and has a great view of the cenpho skyline . <sssss> this morning i had the coke ham and white cheddar omelet ... the toast that came with it was out of this world and the ham was damn good . <sssss> and they served my dawgie water right away ... big ups !
?		two stars because the manager gave me free movie passes and a couple of free snack coupons to make up for my craptastic movie-going experience . <sssss> two adult tickets for a non-matinee is nearly $ 20 . <sssss> the snack bar will hit you for another $ 25 if you take a man -lrb- or individual - mine happened to be male -rrb- who eats anything with you . <sssss> we were early for our movie . <sssss> chose our end-seats toward the back . <sssss> all is well even though everything is overpriced . <sssss> -lrb- waaaaay more than h-word . <sssss> -rrb- four adult women came and sat behind us during the previews . <sssss> they started talking . <sssss> they kept talking . <sssss> i gave them the courtesy `` look . '' <sssss> so did my husband . <sssss> kept talking . <sssss> i got up and alerted a manager . <sssss> came back . <sssss> an usher came in and supervised for a minute . <sssss> he left , they started talking - again . <sssss> this went on for 1.5 hours into a two-hour movie -lrb- unknown , which is great from what i could hear of it ! <sssss> -rrb- we escalated from looks to `` shhhhs '' to shut up to `` oh my god ! '' <sssss> to `` i am going to go get the manager and you will be removed . '' <sssss> well , i slammed my fist into my popcorn bag to indicate to them i was going to get the manager . <sssss> i told the manager what was going on and ... nada !!!!! <sssss> did n't throw them out . <sssss> did n't really seem that apologetic . <sssss> just went through the motions of the tickets and the stuff ... i would have rather enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the movie and taught the b & t #hes a lesson . <sssss> do n't go expecting back-up on the teeny-bopper texting crowd or hoping to get any results from on disrupters . <sssss> just plan on watching the same movie twice . <sssss> from here on out , i do harkins .
?		as below average as one can expect of any restaurant in south scottsdale . <sssss> we wound up here , i do n't know how , for breakfast this morning ... and let 's just say - it was everything i thought it would be . <sssss> snooty waitstaff - check overpriced completely average food - check pretentious crowd - check i got a $ 10 waffle and a $ 3 bottle of figi water . <sssss> my husband had a sip of oj for his $ 2.50 , then spent another $ 2.50 on coffee -lrb- no creamer -rrb- . <sssss> he also had really greasy potatoes and an `` eh '' omelette -lrb- and he is not hard to impress with food -rrb- . <sssss> why two stars ? <sssss> his fruit was good . <sssss> last i checked , that 's thanks to god and good farmers , not snooty scottsdalites . <sssss> we wo n't be back .
?		no tammie coe for me . <sssss> not any more . <sssss> i recently met tammie - which i thought would be an awesome moment in my life - only to find that she is n't all that enthused about her baked goods , or her fans . <sssss> honestly , if you are going to charge me $ 4 or $ 5 for a cupcake , you better damn well be nice about it . <sssss> i had been bragging about tammie coe to my new husband for months now , and was so excited to take him there with his kiddo . <sssss> we showed up only to find the place closed . <sssss> on a saturday afternoon . <sssss> for a month and a half vacation . <sssss> between the `` not-so-kind '' encounter and the fact that they have been closed every time i have attempted to take him there ... i 'm over it . <sssss> sorry tammie coe . <sssss> no more .
?		grew up just a few blocks away from this place and never went in . <sssss> do n't let the outside fool you ! <sssss> tasty , family-friendly pizza joint . <sssss> seems to be a family running it . <sssss> food was above average and the service was great . <sssss> even the pretty picky stepdaughter enjoyed it ! <sssss> we went for plain cheese because my new yorker husband always has to start with a plain cheese `` pie . '' <sssss> give it a try !
?		i love this place and i can only hope it does n't become the next postino . <sssss> -lrb- aka overly trendy and always on top on yelp . <sssss> -rrb- we went here for a first `` couples '' date and the pizza was to die for . <sssss> i have never had sauce this good . <sssss> and , upon my first bite , my first thought was , `` it ca n't actually taste that good ... '' i looked to dh for confirmation and , indeed , it is that good . <sssss> we had to wait quite a while for a table -lrb- there were 4 of us on a saturday night -rrb- , but it was completely worth it . <sssss> we ordered three pizzas and that was plenty for four people . <sssss> had an amazing time and ca n't wait to go back ... thanks cibo !
?		hmmm , `` i 've experienced better '' does actually sum up my meal but i am loath to leave it at that . <sssss> ... i must go on ! <sssss> la bocca is certainly easy on the eyes . <sssss> a little spot on mill with a low neon sign , lovely soft lighting , a stunning bar with an enormous reproduction old dutch master painting of a supple young noblewoman looking over the bar crowd . <sssss> hip urban art on the walls of the dining room , people 's faces lit in low candle lights from the table . <sssss> truly what is not to like ? <sssss> ... i want to join this lovely party . <sssss> i do , with a group of friends on a friday . <sssss> it is early and la bocca is busy but not bustling , their patio is open and the dining room still has some empty tables . <sssss> i look in at this inviting time and think , this will definitely work . <sssss> a glass of wine , maybe a pizza , some bruschetta , i could get used to this wine bar so close to home . <sssss> ahh , and so soon my bubble was to burst . <sssss> first , the hostess . <sssss> seems a little taken aback by the idea of seating us ... a table ... for 4 ... now ? <sssss> k. turns and looks out on to the numerous empty tables ... um , running thru the options , a table ... for 4 ... we wait , people line up behind us , we continue to wait . <sssss> initiative seizes us and we start moving towards an open table . <sssss> i can see the wheels working in her head - people from the outside come inside and they are seeking ... seats ? <sssss> ... what else will she learn tonight ? <sssss> my bubble is not burst , i am actually unaware of the slippery slide towards mediocre restaurant experience i am headed towards . <sssss> so , we are seated and we rummage a bit thru the menu , note the artisan pizzas , the bruchetta , the hummus , cheese plate , salads , pretty simple fare . <sssss> wine menu is nice and i 'm thrilled by the flights . <sssss> nothing fantastic that i could n't find for $ 12 at costplus but still 3 glasses of either white or reds sounds perfect . <sssss> then i notice sangria ... i luv the sangria . <sssss> . <sssss> prepared to order but wait , where is the staff ? <sssss> they pass to the right , they pass to the left . <sssss> . <sssss> but they never stop . <sssss> we are told on 2 separate occasions , our waiter , whose name escapes me but after an hour in his company i came to call dude , was busy . <sssss> interesting , the restaurant is not . <sssss> we waited a half an hour to put in our drink order ... dude approached us and asked , `` so , you ready to get your party on ? '' <sssss> oh , dude . <sssss> it is going to be a long night . <sssss> a round of beers for the boys and the girls split a pitcher of sangria . <sssss> after our drinks and food arrive , i come to realize why dude talks the way he does - okay , let 's party ! <sssss> now , like dude what can i get you ? <sssss> so , does everyun ' get their drink on here ? <sssss> and why , everything seems so faintly familiar ... bcz the bruchetta , the sangria , and the staff are all courtesy of applebees . <sssss> yes , the toasted safeway french bread loaf with the jarred olive tapenade , the canned tomato spread and the artichoke spread would make any applebees fryline cook weep with joy over its mediocrity . <sssss> the sangria came in a sexy tall pitcher with what appeared to be pre-chewed apples floating at the top and tasted like grape juice with an applesauce floater - a tribute to a cheap rip off of a classic . <sssss> there were some high points . <sssss> the hummus was fresh and the pita chips were nicely oiled and toasted . <sssss> the perrone beer was on tap and great . <sssss> the pizza - i have no complaints and its high points are that it was not the bruchetta . <sssss> so , la bocca you are really good lookin ' but you need to figure out what it takes not to be the applebees of wine bars , we have enough of those .
?		what a great way to spend a saturday morning . <sssss> i filled myself up with a mushroom and cheese pastry courtesy of essence , thank you very much . <sssss> i immediately cruised on to gobble up a tamale , some peanut brittle , toffee and thank you sweet republic for a double scoop of ice cream ... so , what does all this binge eating have to do with the farmer 's market ... it is all there to eat baby , ... oh , yeah , and you can really get down and eat here . <sssss> i did notice that there alot of vegetables , a couple of salmon vendors and an organic beef vendor . <sssss> maybe next time . <sssss> . <sssss> all and all , i had a great time , live music lead me merrily through the stalls . <sssss> the vendors are terrific and the dogs are everywhere ... enjoy yourself .
?		house of tricks , my ray of sunshine ! <sssss> the food defies description , it is always , always delicious . <sssss> the wine list is exceptional as is the beer list . <sssss> in fact , hot - now apropo it that ? <sssss> - takes a great deal of pride in its ' bar and it is where you can find me on a friday or saturday afternoon at hot 's happy hour , having a lovely glass of wine , enjoying a taste of a martini - the bartenders are generous and sharing an appetizer or two . <sssss> hot is a great afternoon spot .
?		the boulders is finding its niche and for the bicycle , i 'm getting my drink on crowd , they are fitting in well . <sssss> however , the food has well , fallen in my estimation . <sssss> average bar food is what is being served . <sssss> gone are the plans for a beer dinner with pairings and quality dining . <sssss> it has been replaced with quick foods of pizzas , strombolis and nachos . <sssss> not particularly sparkling but gets the job done when your main attraction is beer and boulders does do beer well . <sssss> the staff has slipped into an easy , we serve those we know best and well , the rest of you , not so much . <sssss> the bar has an easy 20 something feel , and its ' patronage reflects it .
?		really , caffe boa , you know better . <sssss> you know better than letting me stand outside for 15 minutes waiting for your hostess , while you are less than 1/4 full for brunch . <sssss> you know better than charging me $ 14.00 for an eggs benedict that comes with nothing more than 2 eggs on an english muffin . <sssss> i 'm here for the organic , sustainable , impeccable food and i can afford it , but where is it ? <sssss> you know better than giving me a server that knows nothing about your product . <sssss> yes , i do want to know if your meat is local , organic , sustainable . <sssss> i 'm paying $ 14 a head for beakfast , so bring on the knowledge . <sssss> i 'm eating here because you say you serve an organic sustainable product , show me you do . <sssss> also , you know better than giving me a server who looks like they just rolled out of bed in their grubby , stained black pullover . <sssss> i appreciate the attempt at a black uniform but make it clean next time as well . <sssss> finally , if i order two glasses of sparking , do n't charge me $ 18 for the all the can drink , when charging me $ 8 a glass would have been cheaper . <sssss> seriously , is this any better than panhandling ? <sssss> so , where the hell is the caffe boa of dinner fame . <sssss> the food , the knowledge , the attempt to prove to me that what i was paying for was worth it . <sssss> where is that caffe boa ? <sssss> because it sure did n't show up for brunch today .
?		all i can say is whats the big deal !?!? <sssss> why does everybody love changing hands ? <sssss> i went there yesterday and ehhh , its just okay . <sssss> the selection didnt wow me ; heres a tip a book store with a great selection of new and used books , amazon.com . <sssss> bam , i know , i just blew your mind . <sssss> some of the reviews talk about how its so clean inside . <sssss> wait a clean bookstore ? <sssss> because my biggest problem in bookstores is finding transients shooting up in the stacks , ummmm no . <sssss> i have never been in a `` filthy '' bookstore -lrb- if you dont count zorbas , but thats a whole other story -rrb- overall changing hands had a poor selection and was mediocre at best .
?		this place is a glorified subway . <sssss> way overpriced ! <sssss> i went there the first week they opened with a free coupon and i thought i spent too much on the sandwich i got . <sssss> what really grinds my gears is the review of someone claiming its the best philly sandwich in az , are you nuts ! <sssss> personally i like psc in old town the best , but even corleones , which is not good by any means , still is vastly better than what they serve at jersey mikes . <sssss> common people you are better than that than to eat at this dump .
?		two words ; family style . <sssss> forget about bucca di beppo , they dont even compare . <sssss> this place isnt cheap . <sssss> take my advice get 3 friends and order the family style , and dont forget to order seconds ... on everything , you know to take home , for later .
?		i hate the marathon , every year it ruins my life for one day . <sssss> i live in tempe and there is nothing greater than shutting down all the roads near my place and then having to battle with the increased traffic , at least its only once a year , ahhhhhh i forgot about ironman !!
?		yum !! <sssss> i had a great meal at this place and loved their `` no menu '' concept ! <sssss> you are given a list of meats and asked to cross off any you do n't like , there is also a place to note another other dislikes/allergies/etc . <sssss> the boyfriend and i skipped all that and just wrote `` vegetarian '' in big letters at the bottom . <sssss> we had some amazingly rich , flavorful food and interesting ingredients . <sssss> i very much appreciated that both of us were given different vegetarian dishes - that way , i could try eight different courses -lrb- four for each -rrb- . <sssss> i had the best potato soup of my life here . <sssss> and i 've had a lot of potato soup in these 24 years . <sssss> for the price , the portions do seem like your typical small , fancy food plates but i ended up being completely full at the end . <sssss> the cocktails were very weak and it would probably be better bang for your buck to just order a glass of wine . <sssss> although i loved my meal here , i think this place would be more fun for meat eaters as they have some really interesting ones -lrb- kangaroo , quail , frog leg , exotic fish -rrb- on their menu . <sssss> you also probably get the most out of what you are paying , since the vegetarian option is n't any cheaper .
?		i feel like giant coffee is my `` special treat '' kind of place for when i need to pat myself on the back . <sssss> kind of like when i decide to buy groceries at ajs . <sssss> their prices are significantly more than what i pay for my `` everyday '' latte , but their product is exceptional ! <sssss> the iced honey vanilla latte is the best iced latte i have ever had and it tastes great every time . <sssss> to be honest , i do n't think i have ever tried anything else here . <sssss> no need to ! <sssss> the atmosphere here is one of my favorites if i want to get some reading done - i feel like its less distracting than other coffee shops and has big windows that let in the beautiful natural sunlight .
?		i had brunch with my family on the patio at el chorro this morning , and i was quite disappointed with this landmark restaurant . <sssss> we sat on the patio - which was absolutely beautiful -lrb- and the reason this rating gets any stars ! <sssss> -rrb- and had an amazing view of camelback mountain . <sssss> there was also a fair amount of heaters and fireplaces , so it would be nice to sit out there in colder weather , too . <sssss> it was pretty fun to people watch here - everyone was so expensive looking ! <sssss> and , at 23 , i think i was the youngest person there by a solid 15 years . <sssss> the service here was extremely sub-par , especially considering the prices they charge . <sssss> we were greeted with a `` you have reservations , do n't you ?! '' <sssss> no , we do n't . <sssss> and now you just made us feel like we did something wrong by not making them - even though there was plenty of seating ! <sssss> we were seated right away , regardless . <sssss> and , it goes downhill from there . <sssss> the waiter was unfamiliar with the menu and had to have us point to several items on the menu . <sssss> the bus staff that brought us our food had quite a hard time reading the ticket that told them who ordered what , it would have been much faster to ask , `` who had the french toast ?! '' <sssss> i was brought the wrong dish , and when it came out the second time , the eggs were n't cooked how i asked . <sssss> it took a good 15 minutes to get our credit card back from the waiter after we had given it to him to pay . <sssss> i tried to give the staff a little credit , because this place is brand new - but you think in this economy they could hire some experienced wait staff ! <sssss> i thought the prices were ridiculous - $ 6 for a side of 2 eggs ?! <sssss> $ 13 for a fruit bowl !? <sssss> ouch . <sssss> as much i would like to come back for drinks on the patio at sunset , i do n't think i can justify dealing with the staff and prices again .
?		i absolutely love this idea and had a great time here . <sssss> since it was kind of confusing what to do , let me break it down for you : - go in , and order your drink at the bar . <sssss> they have happy hour till 7 -lrb- woo hoo ! <sssss> -rrb- where drinks are $ 1 off . <sssss> - if you are going to see a movie , also tell the bartender you would like to purchase a ticket . <sssss> - once you receive your drinks - go on in and grab a seat ! <sssss> i do n't think any of us received any physical tickets , so do n't worry about that . <sssss> - enjoy your drink and movie ! <sssss> feel free to get up and leave if you want more drinks . <sssss> the theater is smaller and intimate - with seating for about 60 . <sssss> the back area is nice with high tables and bar stools . <sssss> about an hour into the movie , someone came around to the back tables to see if we wanted more drinks . <sssss> my main complaint is the service . <sssss> it was really busy when we went but i still found it unacceptable that i had to ask for a glass of wine three times -lrb- from the same person -rrb- over a 15 minute period before i received it . <sssss> despite the service , i had a great time and ca n't wait to go back !
?		full disclosure : i 'm a vegetarian . <sssss> my family loves steak and i love my family so that explains how i ended up here . <sssss> i have actually been this is steakhouse several times over the years and have enjoyed their grilled portobello mushroom - it was one of the best i had ever had and i was looking forward to eating it again . <sssss> sometime within the past 18 months , they took their beautiful portobello off the menu . <sssss> their new vegetarian `` entrée '' - pick any 3 side dishes . <sssss> are you kidding me ??!! <sssss> that is not an entrée ! <sssss> as a vegetarian , i am used to eating only side dishes at certain places -lrb- like steak houses -rrb- but to have that listed as an the vegetarian entrée is slightly insulting . <sssss> this is a fancy pants restaurant and i would expect them to at least keep some pasta in their kitchen ! <sssss> the waiter lacked genuine warmth . <sssss> when i asked him to talk me about their malbecs -lrb- they had 3 or 4 -rrb- , he only described 1 - their `` feature '' wine . <sssss> when i further inquired , he only talked more about their feature .
?		devoured is my holy day - my christmas , my passover , my winter solstice , my everything . <sssss> this year they showcased nearly 50 local restaurants and 30-some wineries . <sssss> there were several live music acts and people watching to last all day . <sssss> this event is held the perfect time of year - its a nice warm outside , not too hot . <sssss> yes , it can get a bit toasty when standing in the direct sun while consuming alcohol , but that 's nothing an ice cold mai tai from hula 's wo n't fix . <sssss> being a vegetarian at this event is not an issue . <sssss> there are plenty of vegetarian options and many chefs will make you a special little plate of their dish meat-free . <sssss> i sometimes feel a little left out when some of the big-name , popular restaurants do n't offer an option but i can go stuff my belly with something else ! <sssss> i do wish they would cap the number of tickets sold to maybe 2,000 a day . <sssss> i feel like every year this event gets more and more crowded . <sssss> my poor dad who recently had surgery on his feet did not enjoy this event at all because the sheer number of people bumping into him made him uneasy . <sssss> also , what 's up with tammie coe `` selling out '' at every food event i go to before i can try anything ?! <sssss> bring more food , chica !! <sssss> you know you 're popular !!
?		let 's be positive . <sssss> matt 's has the best waffles i have ever had . <sssss> and the pancakes are pretty darn amazing . <sssss> but , matt 's has too many rules . <sssss> especially for a diner-style resturant . <sssss> i feel like every time i go there , i leave being pissed off about something . <sssss> first , no substituions . <sssss> i 'm a vegetarian and most of their dishes come with a side a meat . <sssss> i would rather have a side of potatoes -lrb- and that is cheaper for the resturant than a side of meat -rrb- . <sssss> but , no substituions . <sssss> i have to order `` no meat '' and then pay for a side of potatoes . <sssss> c'mon , now . <sssss> also , no outside beverages . <sssss> matt 's is located in an epicenter of amazing local coffee shops . <sssss> i would like to enjoy a handcrafted latte from lola 's instead of matt 's drip with breakfast - but the waitress will jump on your butt about that coffee cup before you even sit down . <sssss> loosen up , matt . <sssss> it 's a diner . <sssss> awesome tip : matt 's does take-out orders . <sssss> if you 're craving some yummy pancakes on a sunday morning and have no desire to stand outside for 90 minutes - call it in ! <sssss> it will be ready in 15 minutes and you can enjoy a local latte with it !
?		i just had one of the best meals of my life at this joint ! <sssss> i ate everything on my plate which is something my small stomach never can seem to accomplish . <sssss> i ordered a veggie nut burger - which is hands down the best i have ever had ! <sssss> i have been a vegetarian for 6 years and have had veggie burgers all over the world , this one tops it ! <sssss> i think it might have something to do with it being a `` nut '' burger which is not like the usual black bean or mashed veggie burger . <sssss> i also liked how it was chard a little , which gave it that comforting bbq-like texture . <sssss> i chose the steamed vegetables as a side dish which came out as perfectly seasoned and cooked green beans . <sssss> for desert i ordered the red velvet cake -lrb- its not on the menu - so ask ! <sssss> -rrb- , and it was the second best red cake i have ever had - the first is my mama 's recipe . <sssss> i consider myself a bit of a red cake snob , but this one gets two thumbs up ! <sssss> the parking lot a bit too small , which is the downside .
?		i like these dogs because they are more like a sandwich than your typical american frank . <sssss> they are served on a delicious flat bread/pita `` bun '' and are filled with all sorts of toppings - not just ketchup and relish - i 'm talking beans , cilantro , onions , chipotle , cheese , and peppers . <sssss> and yes , they do have a vegetarian one !! <sssss> their mock meat looked so real it was eerie - i took a nibble and i could n't tell if they had accidently given me a real hot dog ! <sssss> so , i tore off a little chunk and showed it to the hot dog man , `` this is a vegetarian one , right ?! '' <sssss> he laughed and said , `` yes . <sssss> we actually get that comment quite often . ''
?		best pancakes in the world !
?		went here for lunch with my husband on a monday . <sssss> we ordered the fez salad -lrb- amazing -rrb- and the phyllo pockets -lrb- even more amazing -rrb- and the bruschetta app ... we were very very pleased ! <sssss> the place is nice and the staff were great ! <sssss> def coming back -lrb- hopefully soon -rrb-
?		i 'm an italian girl from new york and i can honestly say : marcellino is one of the best italian restaurants in the valley . <sssss> if you like home made pasta , flavorful sauces , great wine and all the other elements that make a great italian place - this is it ! <sssss> it even reminds me of a place back east with the owner -lrb- owner 's wife ? <sssss> -rrb- working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter . <sssss> marcellino is not cheap , but it 's price in on par with other high end italian like bravo bistro , um bacio , le cabaffe , tamasos ... etc. . <sssss> but marcellino might be the best !
?		wtf this place has really gone downhill . <sssss> i ate here twice last week and neither time was impressive . <sssss> meal one : my turkey burger was so dry and yucky that i only ate the avocado off the top . <sssss> the burger was like hockey puck . <sssss> the bun was a little stale . <sssss> the fries were okay . <sssss> the waitress did not notice my disdain . <sssss> meal two : seriously the worst grilled cheese panini i ever had . <sssss> the sweet potato fries were okay but did n't hold a candle to fez fries . <sssss> i do like purse hooks at the bar . <sssss> i remember a time when delux served delicious food that was well prepared and um . <sssss> . <sssss> actually tasted good . <sssss> now two sucky sandwiches later i long for the yesteryear of delux . <sssss> even the a la care fries lost their charm . <sssss> step it up delux you are losing me !
?		this place is so cute . <sssss> i love the location and the decor . <sssss> too bad the service was kind of weird and the food was iffy . <sssss> not bad . <sssss> just iffy . <sssss> the first thing everyone mentions about lisa g is thier meatballs . <sssss> the meatballs are okay but not all that . <sssss> i tried them after hearing everyone rant and rave and was a bit dissapointed . <sssss> they were n't bad - just not the amazing experience i 've heard about . <sssss> my sandwhich was not that great either . <sssss> i will say that my dining partners really enjoyed thier food and were quite happy with thier experience . <sssss> in summary - i do n't love the place but most other people do . <sssss> to each his own .
?		best fish joint in town . <sssss> worth every penny . <sssss> here is what i ate tonight : kettle one martini shaken on the rocks - great start sashimi platter - best ahi tuna in the valley , great poke , amazing marlin shrimp cocktail - perfect huge shrimp shrimp and crab chopped salad - one of the best salads i 've had in a while . <sssss> tons of shrimp and crab with blue cheese , walnuts , avocado onion rings with blue cheese fondue sauce - holy shit sole with lemon sauce - yum crab stuffed shrimp - really garlicky but still very good sautéed spinach - perfect ice cream sundae with hot fudge - hells to the yeah cinnamon apple crisp with ice cream - slice of heaven brandy-cinnamon bread pudding - good i ate all this and still want to go back for more . <sssss> i 've never had a bad meal here . <sssss> 5 stars every single time .
?		pre-review note to new yorkers : we know . <sssss> we get it . <sssss> there is no good pizza outside of ny . <sssss> i agree . <sssss> moving on ... i am a true ny'er -lrb- strong island represent ! <sssss> -rrb- and a true pizza snob . <sssss> i usually dislike all pizza that is n't made in new york . <sssss> but actually , i 'm kind of down with this place . <sssss> so it is n't anything like ny pizza . <sssss> big deal . <sssss> the overall food and service is still pretty good . <sssss> i like nypd pizza because you do n't have to order pizza in order to have a good meal . <sssss> the salads are great . <sssss> my fave is the chelsea salad . <sssss> the italian wedding soup is also very good . <sssss> the pastas are pretty good and i 'm not really into tomato sauce . <sssss> the only thing that is truly disappointing is the dessert . <sssss> they make gennaro zeppolis - which are like my favorite thing ever - but at nypd the zeppolis are kind of hard and stale and not delicious and fluffy like in ny . <sssss> so boo for that . <sssss> the pizza is okay . <sssss> maybe even very good . <sssss> yes , new yorkers are going to hate on it and call it crap , but the rest of you should go and enjoy . <sssss> tell them jenny from the block sent you .
?		some things good . <sssss> some things not-so-good . <sssss> overall i 'm actually a fan of z pizza . <sssss> please do not go to z pizza if you seek authentic ny style pizza . <sssss> that would be silly . <sssss> did you really expect a big italian guy named vinnie to toss you up a pie at a california style healthy pizza joint ? <sssss> if so , get real ! <sssss> please do go to z pizza if you would like `` pizza style '' pizza with cool ingredients like fresh artichokes or zucchini . <sssss> i also love the wheat crust or soy cheese options . <sssss> plus , they deliver to my house so fuck yeah for that . <sssss> the yuppie veggie sandwich is sick in a good way . <sssss> it 's really good ! <sssss> please stay away from the tuna salad . <sssss> yukers . <sssss> somehow it was soggy . <sssss> the service has always been pretty good although food can take a little while . <sssss> good effort !
?		if this place was n't so darn convenient i might never come back . <sssss> despite being pissed off every time i come here , i continue to come back again and again . <sssss> in zen 32 's defense , they do have : + a great location + very fresh fish + low carb rolls + possibly the best tuna in town + creative and tasty specialty rolls + good sushi selection + neat little complimentary sunomo type appetizer + a really good drink menu -lrb- yummy plum wine ! <sssss> -rrb- + a great happy hour + great atmosphere unfortunately these great plusses are often overshadowed by these annoying minuses : - long wait for a table , even when several tables are empty - rude/clueless hostesses - rude/clueless manager - crazy overzealous water misters that soak your table -lrb- outdoors -rrb- - most uncomfortable outdoor seating . <sssss> ever - about 2 really good waitresses , and about 10 clueless waitresses - wait staff has no idea what is in the specialty rolls - long wait for food - confusing happy hour rules - tables really close together - disappointing desserts - disappointing appetizers so basically you have to do the math and see if the + 's outweigh the - 's . <sssss> i think they do , so you will probably see me there this week .
?		a dive donut shop ? <sssss> sweet ! <sssss> too bad this place is so meh . <sssss> i was so excited about raibow donut but the donuts are kind of sucky . <sssss> i was also excited about the boba tea -lrb- yes they have it here -rrb- but it was also kind of not good . <sssss> and the bubble tea was made kind of like a frappachino with whip cream and shit . <sssss> what 's up with that ? <sssss> so i guess it 's still kind of cool due to diveyness and whatnot , but not really awesome or anything .
?		sometimes i think that people are willing to let anything slide in order to avoid chain restaurants . <sssss> that is why fate is so successful . <sssss> fate has the rudest staff and worst `` wait '' policy of any restaurant in town . <sssss> the worst part ? <sssss> they make no apology for making you wait outside for a table in 110 degree weather . <sssss> are they on crack ? <sssss> outside ??? <sssss> the whole bar is empty ... yet patrons are relegated to the hot dirty front yard . <sssss> why do you make people wait outside when you are empty ? <sssss> one time i went there and only two tables were occupied . <sssss> they told us there would be a 20 - 30 minute wait . <sssss> i asked why there is a wait as nearly all the tables were open . <sssss> the dumb girl at the door kind of shrugged and said they were n't enough waiters . <sssss> so there are n't enough waiters to handle three tables instead of two ??? <sssss> at least let us wait inside . <sssss> despite the place being empty the mean lady told us to wait outside . <sssss> i said no thanks . <sssss> and stormed off never to return . <sssss> fate is my worst dining experience in arizona so far . <sssss> fate is less than 1 mile from my house , so it saddens me it is n't a place i can call home .
?		we ate here for the first time this morning . <sssss> the food was better than average , the portions were generous and the service was both fast and friendly . <sssss> after seeing that their sausage gravy is made from scratch every day , i had no option but to try it . <sssss> it did n't disappoint . <sssss> it was creamy and delicious but not overly greasy or heavy like sausage gravy can so easily be . <sssss> the omlette my husband and i shared was tasty and the veggies were fresh and plentiful . <sssss> our daughter 's pancakes were fluffy and perfectly cooked and very tasty . <sssss> anytime we do a sleepover at grandma 's in north scottsdale , this is a sure bet for breakfast !
?		i stopped here once before , a long long time ago after it had just opened ... only to find it was closed during it 's normal business hours . <sssss> probably just a fluke ; a new business blunder . <sssss> i meet with a `` green '' moms group from time to time and today we had a lunch date set up for essence . <sssss> i was n't expecting more than the usual `` bakery '' lunch food : chicken or tuna salad on croissants , simple deli style sandwiches . <sssss> but oh ! <sssss> was i pleasantly surprised to find that their food was seriously high quality and locally grown and raised , to boot ! <sssss> their burgers are made from grass fed beef -lrb- that 's what i 'm trying next time -rrb- , their produce comes from a local farm . <sssss> i had the grilled cheese -lrb- mozzerella , tomato , basil -rrb- and it practically melted in my mouth . <sssss> it took a lot of restraint to save half for my husband . <sssss> i also had the soup of the day - bean soup with herbs , and it too was delicious . <sssss> i shared that with my baby . <sssss> the only thing i was able to consume by myself was the salad . <sssss> now , i was in such a hurry because i had to eat , chat and leave within 30 minutes of ordering because we had an appointment with our realtor . <sssss> i remember thinking `` damn , this salad is delicious '' but i ca n't remember what it was that made it so good . <sssss> but take my word for it : the mixed greens salad is good . <sssss> as i said , i met with a moms group , and we ran into a bit of a problem in that the restaurant only has one high chair . <sssss> the bigger kids did fine in regular chairs , but i think they may have opted for a high chair had my daughter not been using the only one . <sssss> we arrived around 11 , and were there for about 45 minutes . <sssss> the place started to get packed around 11:30 and by the time i was wrapping up my meal , it was crowded and noisy , and the other moms and i were talking very loudly in order to hear one another . <sssss> i was told good things about their breakfast ... that 'll be my next trip !
?		my husband and i made it to the farmer 's market early on a saturday , which is quite a feat , so we decided to reward ourselves with breakfast across the street . <sssss> we 'd heard great things about matt 's and i always see a crowd of people waiting outside . <sssss> he waited for our table while i shopped across the way at the farmer 's market . <sssss> while he was waiting he went inside and asked for a cup of coffee . <sssss> he was told that they only sell coffee with to-go orders , so he asked for a coffee `` to go '' . <sssss> he was turned down , so he walked across the street to the farmer 's market and bought some coffee from a stand . <sssss> when our table was ready , they made him stand outside to finish his coffee because they have a strict `` no outside food or drink '' rule . <sssss> pretty lame . <sssss> as far as the food , i had an omelet with spinach , mushrooms , and fontina cheese . <sssss> my husband had an omelet with hard salami . <sssss> while the food was good , it was n't anything i could n't have made at home . <sssss> the star of the meal was the locally made fresh strawberry preserves , but nobody told us that was coming and it did n't go too well with my husband 's sourdough toast . <sssss> a heads up would have been nice . <sssss> i think part of the allure of this place is the fact that there is almost always a crowd of people waiting outside . <sssss> there 's very little chance i 'll ever join them . <sssss> i 'll stick to the breakfast gyros and free samples across the way at the farmer 's market .
?		this place has great food , great happy hour , and a really nice staff . <sssss> and they serve breakfast pretty much all day . <sssss> pretty awesome by my standards . <sssss> the hangover sandwich is a heart attack between two slices of bread , but it 's so worth it . <sssss> the sausage is great , and the way the eggs drip into the sandwich ... mmm ... most of their breakfast dishes come with a side of fresh fruit , which we love because we can share it with the kids . <sssss> oh , and the best part , in my opinion - the breakfast nachos ... i thought my sister and i were the only people in the world who ate nachos for breakfast , but no ... the people at daily dose do it too , and they do it even better than i do ! <sssss> unfortunately we moved from scottsdale , but we 'll be making the trek from tempe to fill our bellies here ! <sssss> it 's a new fave ! <sssss> my only complaint is that it can be a bit slow at times ...
?		wow . <sssss> i ca n't believe it took me so long to finally visit pork in the fork ! <sssss> even though i 've been seeing all the positive reviews for a while . <sssss> well i bought a groupon several months ago for it and i totally forgot about and came on my last day . <sssss> man this was some serious good bbq ! <sssss> we ordered a pulled pork and a brisket sandwich with mac n cheese and corn bread and a side of waffle fries . <sssss> now i 'm picky on bbq and i think i can smoke some good meat in my backyard . <sssss> . <sssss> but this was out of this world . <sssss> the pulled pork was great . <sssss> . <sssss> best i 've ever had at a restaurant . <sssss> and the brisket was full of flavor and i could really taste the smoke . <sssss> i will come back and make it a regular stop . <sssss> located in a small strip mall across from dv airport . <sssss> . <sssss> it 's easily missed . <sssss> not much for ambiance inside but the back room is alright with a few tvs . <sssss> i 'd prob take out next time and they take phone orders so i will order some take out . <sssss> all in all poaf is the best bbq in the phoenix area . <sssss> i 've been to the great salt lick in austin and this gives overall food a run for their money .
?		well i have been going to mellow since it has opened . <sssss> my yelp account says i have 50 check ins , but in reality i have more than 75 check ins . <sssss> so i do love this place . <sssss> the food is awesome , beer is always changing , and happy hour prices ca n't be best . <sssss> so why lowering my review from a 5 star to a 3 star ... the service ... since coming to mellow from the beginning i 've been sitting at the bar . <sssss> i enjoy watching people and interacting with the bar staff . <sssss> mellow had some awesome bartenders in the past , and a few current ones like maralena , but some of the others just do n't seem to care . <sssss> or worst yet . <sssss> . <sssss> because we only come once every few weeks now if days -lrb- too much mellow not good for the diet ! <sssss> -rrb- they seem to give preference to their new regulars from the nearby restaurants . <sssss> i really do n't mind that much , but do n't make me wave you down or ask you for a drink ! <sssss> if you want to ignore me for most part , i 'm ok with that . <sssss> but do n't clean glasses right by me and do n't even look up to see if i 'm wanting another drink or not ? <sssss> that 's my biggest pet peeve . <sssss> on our last visit the other day it took us forever to put a order in even though it was n't that busy . <sssss> i can understand when just 2 bartenders have the bar , bar seating , and patio on a busy night . <sssss> maybe mellow needs to have more staff on those nights . <sssss> anyways i 've had some really great memories of mellow . <sssss> i was coming 2-3 times a week on average and was a strong regular . <sssss> we 've been slowing down on going to mellow mainly of the service . <sssss> easy fix is just to ask if we want anything else , do n't make me ask you as the bartender . <sssss> once or twice i can understand , now it 's becoming a habit . <sssss> hope the manager reads these because i 'd like to share my frustration in greater detail .
?		i think i finally found it . <sssss> possibly the best steakhouse in the valley ! <sssss> i 've always tried to find a steakhouse that reminds me of my all time favorite harris of san francisco . <sssss> i 'm telling you that capital grill was right up there with its dark mahogany decor , classic style , and fantastic service . <sssss> we were lucky enough to have gotten to try out cg on a yelp event . <sssss> i was also informed that they were the only restaurant in the valley that dry ages their meats as most others wet age them . <sssss> my personal favorite is dry so that info and the tasting was all i needed for me to make dinner reservations as soon as i could . <sssss> lucky for us az restaurant week was coming and i saw gc on the list . <sssss> what a great deal , $ 40 a person for salad , steak , dessert . <sssss> we decided to forgo any drinks for the lobster mac & cheese for $ 15 extra . <sssss> wow glad we did !! <sssss> starting with the caesar salad it was well done . <sssss> not much more to say here . <sssss> for dinner i ordered the 8oz filet prepared medium . <sssss> came out perfect . <sssss> i tend to like my filet more rare than medium and that 's what came out . <sssss> amazing . <sssss> they gave me a steak knife but i could have used a butter knife to cut the meat . <sssss> i savored every bite . <sssss> the wife ordered the kona crusted bone in ribeye . <sssss> very tasty . <sssss> i loved the bone in and the kona coffee crust ! <sssss> this steak was actually more tasty than mine , but i would still order the filet because of the quality . <sssss> but both steaks were truly amazing ! <sssss> ending with desert the wife had the chocolate cake made without flower and i had the crème brulé . <sssss> both were amazing . <sssss> overall we had a amazing dinner at capital grill . <sssss> we will be back !
?		ok this was my 2nd time here and i think it worth a fair review . <sssss> first of all nimbus is a tucson area brewery . <sssss> they have the brewery and a tasting room/restaurant like the one there in tucson too . <sssss> that being said when i first came in my my cats shirt the waitress said `` go cats ' and i felt like i was at nimbus in tucson : -- rrb - . <sssss> my wife is a sun devil so she was n't so impressed . <sssss> we had a groupon for 2 salads , 2 beers , and 1 pizza . <sssss> great deal for 15 bucks . <sssss> we decided on mac n cheese pizza , rye ipa , old monkey shine , and garden salads . <sssss> what can i say ? <sssss> the beer was great !!! <sssss> and the salads were surprising good . <sssss> the man n cheese pizza stole the show though . <sssss> it was amazing . <sssss> yes bacon man n cheese on a pizza ! <sssss> during our first trip here they were playing monday night trivia and we watched the packers and seahawks and the end of game call ! <sssss> fun time . <sssss> we went here the next week after at the end of the uofa game . <sssss> too bad they did not play the game here . <sssss> some drama with pac 12 and directtv . <sssss> anyways yelp unlocked us a pizza and beer for 10 bucks so i brought my friend here for the mac n cheese pizza and ipa . <sssss> great and my friend loved it too . <sssss> all in all nimbus is a great place . <sssss> it 's a little tucked away but very low key and friendly and plain old good beer and good pizza . <sssss> lots of tvs around and a huge patio . <sssss> i will for sure be back here !
?		stopped here even though i 'm way against anything to do with `` sun devils '' . <sssss> lol . <sssss> great beer selection of super hard to find brews . <sssss> even better wine selection downstairs and a laid back lounge . <sssss> we stopped by and the wife had a glass of wine and i had a pint of beer republic beer . <sssss> great bartender downstairs with knowledge of beer and wine . <sssss> i would totally come here to shop and have a drink downstairs in the lounge .
?		great place . <sssss> try the voltron 8.3 imperial red . <sssss> its a seasonal brew , so try it soon !
?		i must update my first review of san tan . <sssss> after visiting many breweries in the state this is probably still my favorite local brewery . <sssss> first off i like that it 's in an old bank in downtown chandler . <sssss> i also like that they have garage style doors behind the bar so you can have fresh air inside . <sssss> 2nd is the beer . <sssss> it 's amazing ! <sssss> i think the negro nitrogen black ipa is one of my favorite beers of all time ! <sssss> it 's like a cross of a ipa and a smooth stout . <sssss> i love this beer ! <sssss> i also love their seasonal imperial red . <sssss> lately i have been buying the devils ale and hopshock ipa in cans for home . <sssss> i do n't think i have bought any other beer for a while . <sssss> there are many other beers here and i like most of them . <sssss> lastly the food is really really good . <sssss> especially their burgers . <sssss> they are stuffed with cheese and are amazing . <sssss> i wish i lived closer to san tan . <sssss> i 'm lucky my brother in law does live close though so i always attempt to come down here when i 'm visiting family .
?		this mall is decent . <sssss> the type of people that come here make this mall more appealing then some other malls -lrb- cough az mills & fiesta mall -rrb- . <sssss> it is n't a ghetto mall except for the dumbest store i 've ever seen called swagg . <sssss> sorry tom haverford this idea is stupid . <sssss> there are stores that have been here since the beginning and there are spots of the mall that constantly have a new store in them . <sssss> give up people . <sssss> some spots will never have success . <sssss> all the main stores people want are here . <sssss> there are n't as many luxury brand stores like scottsdale mall has but not bad . <sssss> there are pretty good food options here but not as good as san tan . <sssss> there is free wifi here so that is a bonus .
?		first and foremost , always use a coupon . <sssss> if you live in chandler they should come in the mail every other week . <sssss> this will save you at least $ 12 . <sssss> everyone here is friendly . <sssss> the food has never disappointed and i 've been here about 100 times . <sssss> there are many good selection . <sssss> the shredded beef taco is big and juicy . <sssss> it tastes amazing . <sssss> the burritos are decent but are a little bland . <sssss> the chimichanga is good , but is it worth the extra calories for being deep fried ? <sssss> that all depends on your metabolism . <sssss> my new favorite choice here is the mexican pizza . <sssss> it is huge and filling . <sssss> there are so many different flavors going on . <sssss> the chips and salsa here are my favorite -lrb- tied with serrano 's that is -rrb- . <sssss> there is also a nice patio outside on a pond with a water fountain in the water that lights up at night . <sssss> it looks pretty cool .
?		the hair that was baked into my muffin was not as delicious as some may believe . <sssss> watch for hairs before you bite into your muffin . <sssss> ; -rrb- luckily the service , especially the guy at the register -lrb- oliver -rrb- , were really nice and made the experience better .
?		every time i come to this location the food is perfect . <sssss> the burgers are so juicy and cooked to perfection . <sssss> they have a condiments bar with fresh vegetables . <sssss> the fries are my favorite of all time . <sssss> they have the new soda fountain machines that are touch screen and let you create a custom soda . <sssss> the price is a little higher then most but you get what you pay for . <sssss> i ca n't think of a reason to take away a star .
?		no bueno . <sssss> the food here was not that good and the options were limited . <sssss> i ordered something and they were out of it which forced me to eat something i did n't want . <sssss> the bruschetta was pretty good but not worth the price . <sssss> only came here for the coupon and wo n't come back . <sssss> the place seem a little dirty .
?		i have been a fan of true food at the biltmore for a while now and recently decided to try this location . <sssss> my husband and i loved our lunch . <sssss> we started with the edamame dumplings which were very tasty . <sssss> for mains my husband had the bison burger which he enjoyed and i tried the organic ricotta ravioli which was really delicious ! <sssss> i also had their red moon drink which is made up of pink grapefruit , yuzu , agave and soda ... very tasty and refreshing . <sssss> i have to say i prefer the location of this true food ... love the outdoor seating and the nice open feel .
?		had never eaten here before but due to seeing an amazing coupon deal decided to try it out . <sssss> for two people you can get 4 courses for $ 29 ! <sssss> basically you are only being charged for the entrees . <sssss> the good was the appetizer of coconut shrimp , the entree of sizzling saigon shrimp was really tasty and we shared a very original dessert of white chocolate champagne cake which we both enjoyed . <sssss> the only complaint was the beef which was a little chewy and flavorless and the decor could also use a little updating . <sssss> the service was awesome though . <sssss> we will be back for the shrimp and to try a few other things .
?		had a yummy lunch here after strolling around the gardens . <sssss> tried the beet salad with chicken and it was delicious ! <sssss> my 3 year old daughter had the hot dog and fries which she enjoyed . <sssss> i really wanted to sit outside as it looked really pretty out on the patio but my daughter wanted to sit inside and she was hungry so did n't want to upset her further ! <sssss> it was nice inside also as there is plenty of natural light and you still have views of the patio area . <sssss> the staff were very helpful and friendly . <sssss> we will definitely have lunch here again next time we go to the gardens .
?		dined here again recently with my husband who thoroughly enjoyed it . <sssss> we had a 15 minute wait to be seated but that is all good ... reassuring to know you are not the only people who would like to eat there . <sssss> we tried the turkey burger and the roasted garlic , wild mushroom and tuscan kale pizza both delicious . <sssss> we also had the organic honey lemonade which is amazingly tasty and refreshing ! <sssss> wonderful little lunch spot .
?		even more great news ... on tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce . <sssss> not that i needed another incentive ... but this is great .
?		had a lovely christmas dinner at t. cook 's : -rrb- as it was just the three of us this year we decided to go out for christmas dinner and we had a truly wonderful meal in a very pretty setting . <sssss> for appetizers we had the lobster bisque with asparagus and caviar and the wild burgundy escargot with crisp brioche , lightly scrambled eggs , mushrooms and roasted garlic mascarpone cheese ... both were delicious . <sssss> for mains we tried the slow roasted lamb stuffed with feta , tomatoes and oregano on a bed of marinated tomatoes , roasted green peppers and fingerling potatoes as well as the glazed ham with italian fennel sausage dressing , haricot vert , sweet potato gratin and cranberry relish ... tastebud sensations ! <sssss> once again we sat on the patio which was just perfect with christmas day temps in the 70s . <sssss> we had our beautiful newborn with us and when she got slightly fussy we were able to calm her down by walking through the gorgeous gardens and courtyards . <sssss> she just loved all of the beautiful colors and smells : -rrb- the staff were also wonderfully friendly and helpful . <sssss> highly recommend t. cook 's for any meal or event .
?		finally got to try this place . <sssss> i loved the decor , definitely felt like i was in the1950 's ... i also liked reading the history of the establishment and that the owners are the original owners from when it first opened in 1958 ! <sssss> unfortunately for me i am allergic to cream ... a very horrid affliction ... i can eat the fake whipped in a can cream for some reason with no problems ... but give me real tasty cream and it just does not work out ... unfortunately for me but fortunately for most everyone else they serve the real deal ... so i had to just watch as others devoured this tasty treat ... i was able to order a very delicious brownie though that was to die for ! <sssss> it is possibly even tastier if you are able to keep the `` nestled under a mountain of whip cream '' as the menu reads . <sssss> my husband thoroughly enjoyed the `` gosh-awful-gooey banana split '' ... and said he even remembers eating here years ago with his parents ! <sssss> an added bonus is the family circus cartoon connection ... go check it out !
?		overpriced and overrated !!!! <sssss> i can not believe how much money i spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas . <sssss> $ 25.46 the mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes , the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag . <sssss> plesto sauce was okay . <sssss> the roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement . <sssss> two thick slices of overdone beef , two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached -lrb- who wants to eat that ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> when i say thick , i mean , 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread . <sssss> these sandwhiches were $ 9.50 each !!!! <sssss> we got one with pasta salad -lrb- corkscrew pasta and a dressing , no veggies or color -rrb- and a green salad -lrb- lettuce and dressing , nothing else -rrb- . <sssss> we also got two diet cokes . <sssss> in a can !!!! <sssss> for $ 2.25 each !! <sssss> they did ` nt offer a glass , ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge , but no , nothing , niet . <sssss> this place might be okay if you are in the area , at the building working or visiting someone , but we drove from ahwatukee . <sssss> so not worth it . <sssss> do not drive to this place . <sssss> do not go out of your way for this place .
?		good food and comfortable atmosphere . <sssss> that 's for those that just need to scan real fast for the best parts . <sssss> fondue with pretzel bread dippers were awesome . <sssss> i had the warm italian grinder . <sssss> i really like the meats , peppers , cheese and bread but prefer my hot/warm sandwiches do not have any lettuce or tomatoes on it . <sssss> it was not mentioned on the menu so i 'm warning you now . <sssss> i liked the fries , skinny and crispy . <sssss> i also tried a bite of the shaved prime rib dip and really liked it . <sssss> other items i had a bite of : the mac burger had quality meat but was over cooked . <sssss> we sat outside , it was the first week of november , got ta love this desert for this reason alone . <sssss> we were very comfortable and served very well by a handsome gentleman but for the life of me i can not remember his name . <sssss> he had tattooed arms . <sssss> oh wait , so did other servers . <sssss> they all seemed nice . <sssss> i will be back dropout .
?		i do n't know where they get the pickles that go in the beef gyro 's but i can not get enough . <sssss> so yummy , i always ask for more . <sssss> this place takes me out of the desert and puts me in a much more hip city . <sssss> i absolutely love the tsatziki , full of garlic that you are protected from vampires but can not kiss another human being until you do a thorough mouth clean up . <sssss> still worth it . <sssss> bad for first date . <sssss> go here . <sssss> eat here . <sssss> your will be pleased . <sssss> if not , there might be something wrong with you !
?		the salad in my sandwich was a great idea . <sssss> lettuce , tomatoes , onion , pepperoncini tossed in balsamic vinegar , oh my , and then piled onto a fresh roll with ham and salami with mayo and mustard . <sssss> not too bad , i must say . <sssss> it is , however , too bad the salami was a cheaper kind and not a dry italian salami . <sssss> it kind of made the sandwich a little salty , but doo-able none the less . <sssss> i ordered the pasta salad as a side . <sssss> i wont make that mistake again . <sssss> it 's my understanding that pasta salad will be on the acidic side , usually involving vinegar of some kind . <sssss> this pasta salad was not acidic at all . <sssss> it included cabbage , carrots , sun-flower seeds and a taste that i still cant place . <sssss> it looked like it was a `` bus-tub '' salad . <sssss> i took two bites and gave up , no sense in wasting calories . <sssss> overall , i think this place has potential , but my experience was nothing to write home about , sorry mom . <sssss> fortunately for the rest of you ... i 'm addicted sharing my experiences : be them bad , good or just so-so , lucky you !!
?		update : just went here tonight with my friends and the food was great , but the pizzas took forever . <sssss> we never said a word yet the manager came and apologized and offered us a free dessert . <sssss> then the checks took forever and it ended up being a 2 hour dinner . <sssss> the manager came over again and apologized and comped our entire meal and gave us a $ 25.00 gift certificate . <sssss> talk about customer service ! <sssss> what a great way to treat clients ! <sssss> besides the long dinner the food was excellent . <sssss> their duck confit appetizer and little apple fritter dessert are both out of this world excellent . <sssss> will be definitely going back soon .
?		it has been a long time since i have posted a review on yelp . <sssss> that 's because its been a long time since i have felt passionately enough about a dining experience one way or another to throw my proverbial 2 cents in . <sssss> unfortunately stax was such a horrible experience that i had to yelp about it . <sssss> i do n't know if it was just because of the open patio or what , but we sat inside and there were flies and moths all over the place . <sssss> i just hope the kitchen is n't some nightmare that i would see on a gordon ramsey show . <sssss> the menu looks promising with several different style of burgers ranging from the mundane to the exotic , sides and different aoli 's -lrb- which is really mayo just mixed with something else and put into a cup -rrb- . <sssss> the thing that really bothered me is that there are no regular french fries . <sssss> call me old fashioned , but i love french fries and do n't understand this decision . <sssss> i got both styles of beef burgers and the meat was overcooked , dry , and the food took over an hour to get out . <sssss> they also forgot our sweet potato fries and onion rings and those took another 15 minutes to get out . <sssss> needless to say the service was terrible . <sssss> the waitress did n't even know what deserts they had , she had to look at a menu ... to sum it up , horrible service , terrible food , and extremely overpriced . <sssss> the only people i could see liking this place are people who like to be scene but if your looking for a good burger you will do yourself a favor to go someplace else .
?		this is by far my favorite lunch spot in the valley . <sssss> the fact that it also is a grocery store only adds to its charm . <sssss> all the ingredients are fresh and the servings are big . <sssss> i reccomend the itialian sausage and there cold chicken pasta is wonderful . <sssss> highly reccomended for anyone who wants a nice little lunch spot . <sssss> be warned though , wait times can be very long . <sssss> if your willing to wait though this is a great spot .
?		i think overall this place has great middle eastern food . <sssss> i did n't get to try all the platters i wanted but i was impressed with the main entrees . <sssss> the lebanese chicken was delicious . <sssss> service was great too , as our questions were answered all the way through . <sssss> i would like to come back to try some other dishes .
?		this place has it all . <sssss> great burgers , pizzas , salads & desserts . <sssss> the breakfast also holds its own weight . <sssss> ran by great people , it 's a place you should check out when you can .
?		the menu selection was fair and food was authentic . <sssss> their price for korean bbq was cheap compare to other korean bbq restaurants . <sssss> service was good , they noticed and asked me if i want more free side dishes that came with the meal when they spotted my empty plate before i even have to ask . <sssss> it 's my new favorite korean restaurant for sure !!!
?		i have heard about this place for couple years before i actually get to try it out . <sssss> their guacamole burger is my favorite , and the peanut butter malt was just amazing !! <sssss> first time i tried , i ended up getting another one to go . <sssss> they also have corn beef sandwich on thursday , which i have n't get the chance to try yet . <sssss> only thing i dislike is that they close at 8 pm which is a bit too early for me .
?		i went with my friend for his birthday . <sssss> he ordered 12 oz new york and i ordered the 8 oz tenderloin . <sssss> i knew what different cuts of meat look and taste like . <sssss> i meant business when it comes to steak !! <sssss> our cook prepped our food in front of us , i noticed how each steak has different cut , while ny was chunky and short , my tenderloin was thinner . <sssss> while i turned around in middle of the conversation , the steak was served onto my plate , and the first thing i noticed was how chunky it was . <sssss> after trying the first bite , i know immediately that was not a tenderloin . <sssss> just to make sure , i tried a piece of what was served to my friend , and i noticed my `` tenderloin '' was chewy and lean -lrb- what ny steak normally taste like -rrb- while his `` ny steak '' was soft and fatty -lrb- what tenderloin normally taste like . <sssss> -rrb- i brought this to the manager 's attention , he came over and looked at the meat and told me that my experience with tenderloin could be improved if i requested to have my steak cooked with garlic butter . <sssss> i informed the manager how each plate of steak tasted like and he insist that the fat / garlic butter makes all the difference . <sssss> -lrb- keep in mind , my friend also did n't request the garlic butter . <sssss> -rrb- lastly , he walked away with `` but i will see what i can do '' and never come back to the table again till everyone got their desert when they do the birthday picture for the table . <sssss> i left my steak untouched simply cause i was n't sure if they will correct my order ... and end up leaving the place $ 40 short and hungry . <sssss> i feel i was treated like a restart and very disrespectfully . <sssss> i was n't taken serious and my concerns were taken lightly . <sssss> though getting me what i ordered correctly would be nice -lrb- which did n't happen -rrb- , an apology would be highly appreciated -lrb- which also did n't happen . <sssss> -rrb- as much as i love tepanyaki , i will never return to this location .
?		their cat fish and fried chicken was flavorful and tasty . <sssss> but my tiny bowl of collard green had enough salt for a dozen of margarita at least . <sssss> i was not able to taste anything after a bit of collard green and was too full to eat anything else after drinking a bunch water . <sssss> service was friendly though . <sssss> will go back again when in mood for fried chicken or waffle . <sssss> but will skip collard green and go with something else .
?		i confess , i ca n't drink regular soda . <sssss> so i was n't able to enjoy the big selling point of the store . <sssss> but my friends enjoyed them and could n't recommend them enough . <sssss> i like the vibe of the store , the decor , and the friendly staffs . <sssss> i had the coney island hotdog -lrb- chilli cheese dog -rrb- with potato salad . <sssss> i like how the chili and the potato salad are store made and not bought . <sssss> you can taste the difference in flavor and in freshness . <sssss> will definitely go back with other soda drinking friends .
?		the service was excellent ! <sssss> no doubt !! <sssss> our waiter and water boy was so attentive , kind , and knowledgeable for all our questions . <sssss> the price was fair for the quality of food they serve . <sssss> i was not impressed by the fleming potato , but loved the crab cake and my bone in rib eye steak . <sssss> only down fall would be the restaurant was rather loud on the night of our visit and i felt like i was at applebee 's / ihop and had to raise my voice periodically to be heard by my friend who was sitting next to me . <sssss> over all happy with the place ! <sssss> will go back for special occasion or good piece of steak for sure !!!
?		catching a suns game in the us airways center is liking finding an archaic , beaten down , and otherwise , divey roadhouse that has the capital to serve foie gras , santa maria steak , fresh cut sweet potato fries , caramel infused churros , and live oak hefewiezen . <sssss> such a house is not fit for vamp choices , like the us air center is not fit for superior products like nash , amare , shaq , and bell . <sssss> the arena is too small , the grade of the grandstands is too flat , the mezzanine does not overlap the lower deck , the sound does n't keep , the lighting is dismal , the baseline is wasted on a humongous media center , the concourse is narrow and difficult to navigate , the plaza is lame , and as a whole , has an extremely goofy nickname . <sssss> buuuut ... the `` purple palace '' does have an inviting , simplified , and cozy atmosphere . <sssss> every sightline is a good one . <sssss> the commodity that they place on the court 41 times a season is exciting and entertaining and competitive . <sssss> after all , as sports fans , moreover , as valley sports fans , all we ask is a little run to the playoffs , and maybe , just maybe falling into a finals appearance . <sssss> we are n't spoiled here . <sssss> we 'll sit out in the triple digits if it means the cards could finish above .500 , we 'll clamor for overinflated tickets for a division series in baseball , and we 'll certainly take the pratfalls of our dinky nba arena if it means the suns continue to play the most exciting brand of basketball in the laborious and superior western conference . <sssss> i just think the valley 's best and most consistent team deserves something similar to the staples center than something that should have been erected in salt lake city .
?		i can not fathom why somebody +21 would go here other than the cruel initiation of a community college rugby hazing or you are someone who thinks some chick from mountain view will check out your onions if you buy her a couple of screwdrivers .
?		tt is generally the type of place that i 'm cuckoo for , but this joint delves too deep into the ` macabre ' subdivision between edgy and strange . <sssss> thats good . <sssss> they 've got their thing going on , and they certainly do n't need me dorking up their bar , but i 'd like to enjoy it more , with their well-kept horseshoe bar , modest beer prices , and killer juke . <sssss> i remember back in the day when tt mirrored what i 'd imagine chong 's rec room to look like , complete with a very , phil spector inspired , ` wall of smoke ' . <sssss> i think when this went away , i started enjoying it less , even though my contacts could only last about 30 second in that cancer sauna before they would want to commit seppuku by leaping off my eyeballs and onto the dirty floor below . <sssss> this bar is very good if this is your scene . <sssss> three if its not quite .

?		max fischer : what was your major ? <sssss> rosemary cross : i did n't have a major , but my thesis was on latin american economic policy . <sssss> max fischer : oh , that 's interesting . <sssss> did you hear that they 're not going to teach latin anymore ? <sssss> rosemary cross : this was more like central america . <sssss> ha . <sssss> okay . <sssss> that exchange does n't have anything to do with my review of havana cafe , only that it dances with the south-of-the-equator theme . <sssss> which , in actuality , is the same concept of havana cafe . <sssss> that is , its a cuban restaurant with heavy latin american themes . <sssss> first , and i must emphasize , foremost , their alcohol selection is nothing short of brilliant . <sssss> they import an enormous amount of south american and european-cum-latin influenced wines and serve it both by the ounce and the liter . <sssss> fascinatingly , they have portuguese reds , which i have been exhaustively looking for , either in-store or dine-in around the valley . <sssss> praise be , i 've finally found the place ! <sssss> they also offer argentine reds and whites , chileans sav blancs , and spanish tempranillos . <sssss> perfect selection , and very reasonable for their exclusivity . <sssss> their douro was a serf-encouraging $ 8 . <sssss> that 's not very many escudos , no not at all . <sssss> for beer , they had several unique selections , most notably the inclusion of argentina 's quilmes . <sssss> honestly , i can not remember what other selections they had , though i remember being roused by the list , only to be seduced by the porteno brew of choice . <sssss> their selection of rums , and the accompanying list of rum cocktails was also impressive , though sadly sans havana club rum due to america 's archaic embargo vs the snarky nation of cuba . <sssss> blast . <sssss> when the food came out , i was impressed by the presentation . <sssss> to start , my gf found it in her gullet to order the hearts of palm/carrot/various rabbit food appetizer , which was heavily drowned in vinegar . <sssss> i liked it , but she did n't care for it all too much . <sssss> my app was the serving of 3 croquetas filled with ham with a side of mildly spicy aioli . <sssss> not bad , but slightly mushy . <sssss> fry them up a couple more minutes and i would have gladly accosted my taste buds with volcanic pork pieces even further . <sssss> my entree was the poached chicken with shrimp and rice , which tasted well and good on the first try , but went up to 11 on the re-heat the next day . <sssss> fucking glorious . <sssss> my gf had the stuffed squash with a jamaican curry cream sauce . <sssss> she was thrilled with it because she likes vegetables and shit , and this was the motherload of veggie heaven -- veggies filling veggies like some plant orgy . <sssss> okay , so why the empty star ? <sssss> its pricey . <sssss> what was meant to be a casz dinner ended up surpassing the century mark . <sssss> not a problem really , since we got 2 rounds of the good stuff , plus basically dinner/lunch out of it , but it could turn some people off . <sssss> all in all , i felt it was slightly over-valued . <sssss> still , this will not keep me from coming back . <sssss> there is just too much fucking potential here and so many unfurled selections . <sssss> i 've got ta take down their wine list . <sssss> i wonder if they offer an around-the-world-wine-club card like some cheesedick chain like the yard house . <sssss> i will be here for as many happy hours and apps as is necessary to finance the country of cuba and bypass any restrictions put onto me by the governments . <sssss> go here and do your part too .
?		a few years ago , while i was still developing my palate , i thought this place was great . <sssss> now , i regard it as what it pretends * not * to be , and that is a light-lunch spot for salads and sandwiches . <sssss> i 'm not necessarily ` dogging ' this place . <sssss> not at all . <sssss> i 've enjoyed quite a few lunches here and having a glass of wine is really enjoyable with a salad or a sandwich in midday and in midtown . <sssss> but so many people go over-the-top when rating this restaurant . <sssss> its a neat little place ... i adore the large windows looking out onto mcdowell , the retro billboard above the structure , and the fact that this corner is the entryway into the most funky part of phoenix ... it has quite a few interesting things going for it . <sssss> so , my florist gets an appropriate rating of 3 stars .
?		jesus . <sssss> i 'm just going to write a normal review here , if that 's quite alright with the homosexual set , after reading the elaborate gay porn allusions detailed and manifested by their experiences at a simple car wash outpost . <sssss> erm , anyway , this place is pretty freaking great . <sssss> for a cool $ 12 , i was able to have my -lrb- gasp ! <sssss> -rrb- suv washed , vacuumed , and wiped by several people that appear to have a system , though over the course of my countless visits , have neglected to figure it out . <sssss> the cost is cheaper for your those of you with the kind of whips that take less than $ 50 to fill up -- i think as low as $ 9 for the basic wash . <sssss> this place is certainly worth the time -lrb- it takes about 20-25 mins -rrb- and the paltry scratch out of your pocket . <sssss> it is very easily accessible , especially for those of us in cenpho -lrb- oooo , burn ! <sssss> i said `` it '' -rrb- . <sssss> who washes their own cars in this day and age , anyway ?
?		i ca n't make up my mind about rosie 's . <sssss> a good happy hour bar , sure , though i never seem to make it anywhere near the universal discounted-beer-cut-off-time , so it always seems like when i go here , i 'm in the happy hour mood at 10 o'clock pm . <sssss> i just has a strange ambiance . <sssss> i enjoy the decor , though they are only one footy kit away from being hokey . <sssss> rosie 's has a good selection of irish spirits and beers , though for some reason i ca n't get any more creative than a half-n-half here ... something about this bar has that order ingrained in my pea-sized-drinkin-brain . <sssss> i really want to check out some premier league games here , scottish or english . <sssss> i 've had their food and it is your typical irish grub . <sssss> i wonder if anyone irish would find any of our silly irish-american fare remotely interesting . <sssss> the smoking patio is far too small and seems to have some sort of gravitational pull for all the jerk-offs in the bar to congregate . <sssss> i thought they were giving away free samples of american crew hair paste for men one night out there . <sssss> i was afraid to lite up for taking out ` three-stars ' rosie 's .
?		portland 's is not the kind of place that is gon na ` wow ' you with anything outrageous or unique , but as it stands , it 's a cozy-feeling wine bar putting up the good fight as a downtown outpost of social activity past 5pm . <sssss> the bar is the first of its kind in phoenix -- at least in the last 40 years or so -- to be incorporated as a important portion of mixed use development , providing much needed libations and nourishment for tenants of downtown midrise condo living . <sssss> for this , i truly salute portland 's . <sssss> this bar not only sees its share of regulars -- likely upstairs tenants -- but also mid-week imbibers of wine and beer , which keeps the crowd fresh , interesting , and rotating . <sssss> they even have some decent set-ups for subtle cross-bar hd sports watching ... prevalent , but unimposing . <sssss> their patio addresses the cleverest part of central phoenix , essentially the gateway into downtown and the oddly designed city-roof that is the 7th to 7th pathway . <sssss> the vibe is a good one because the neighborhood is charming and as close to urbanism as phx will allow .
?		shame on me for not acquiescing to the frequent requests by my gf to hit up one of the most alluring valley cafes . <sssss> the paisley violin is gills full of progressive and retro designs and a charmingly simplistic menu of favorites , including eggwiches , croissants , sandwiches , salads , and plates containing very fresh ingredients like organic vegetables , cheeses , cured meats , hummus , and a variety of sauces to name just a very minimal amount . <sssss> the prices are lower than what would be considered ` reasonable ' and the service is quick and attentive but not overbearing . <sssss> however , the real reason to visit the paisley violin is for the incredible ambiance , whether you sit inside in its darkened labyrinth of art , books , and counter snacks , or outside on its expansive , heavily shaded patio , complete with an artistic fountain and 6 tiny and freshly brightened bungalow houses in a pseudo shopping district right there in their back yard . <sssss> according to our server one house will contain a flower shop ; one , a bookstore ; and the another , a tobacco shop . <sssss> the other three are tbd . <sssss> it is a brilliant concept , which makes their back patio seem infused with organic commerce and street life , but without being invasive or ` busy ' . <sssss> i absolutely can not wait for these places to open , sipping a chai latte with a shot of espresso -lrb- my gf 's signature drink called a ` dirty chai latte ' -rrb- and gazing at these magnificent store fronts , each painted in a wide palate . <sssss> one other note : the paisley violin is no longer byob , as they are awaiting the lead-legs of the city to approve , get this , their liquor license ! <sssss> fans of the paisley violin will appreciate that spirits will now be available -- although bringing your own vino to the back patio seemed like one hell of a bargain to rent their space for the evening . <sssss> i am eagerly awaiting when alcohol will be allowed back on the premises because this place will be the gem of downtown .
?		south mountain is the place for a hiker to visit when he/she does n't want to deal with the headaches and the mass of humanity that are camelback and piestawa . <sssss> granted , there are reasons for their popularity , and no , south mountain is n't really on their level as far as personal challenge or scenic masterpieces go , but its a very solid alternative for a weekend hike when you know that the line of cars for parking is stretched a mile long in central/north phoenix . <sssss> my gf and i usually hike the alta trail , which is a progressively steep trail up to the peak , but still a manageable grade in slope that you will never have to use your hands to ascend or descend . <sssss> it takes about an hour and 15 mins to go up and down the mountain , and the view of sopho , downtown , glendale , and tempe are killer . <sssss> its a great place to snap a few pics of the enormous city below . <sssss> typically , we will run into one or two hikers maximum on this hike , which pretty cool for some solitary reflection . <sssss> lately , i 've taken up bringing my ipod along , as there is nothing quite like descending the valley into the park amongst massive mountains with band of horses or the national narrating your steps musically . <sssss> breath taking .
?		typically a crowded mess of striped button downs and buckle shoes , but hey , everyone likes what they like , which is fortunate for me , because * i * especially like that dos can corral most of the people i generally abhor into one perfect , double-decker horny beehive . <sssss> i simply do not understand how this faction of people exist to be ridiculous , 30-something wankers , itching for piece of college ass where survival-of-the-fittest theory would generally chew these hopefuls up and spit them out into yuma for being downright useless to the perpetuation of modern society . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> you wan na see some mouthbreathers ? <sssss> wan na be baptized clumsily in corona by a swallow of leather-sandaled , pleated beta kappa class of ' 94 ? <sssss> here 's your shot . <sssss> i ca n't get over how annoying most of these people are . <sssss> they must be a pleasure to know and buy drinks for and invite over for your super bowl party . <sssss> this place would be pretty awesome if not for the `` half-your-age-plus-seven '' 's . <sssss> after all , it is a good place to day drink .
?		this place can get really awesome or really dull dependent on one solitary man resembling a leprechaun with a filthy mouth and penchant for calling out mouthy toolbags , all while playing the guitar and happily caroling away in irish drinking hymnals . <sssss> it can get really crowded , which makes standing really tedious and plants a target on your big forehead for the leprechaun to abuse . <sssss> on st. paddy 's day , this place is chaos , and like most other forced holidays is not worth getting into the carnival atmosphere just to say you did it . <sssss> cash-only holidays get old in a hurry .
?		can you be a member of phx yelp having not reviewed delux ? <sssss> this is like being jumped into los yelpes gigantes . <sssss> since delux has been reviewed consistently for over two years , there is nothing that i can offer as a varied opinion , but i thought , what the hell ? <sssss> i do n't stop breathing air just cos everyone else has already done it . <sssss> some things are necessary . <sssss> delux is like your all-time favorite song . <sssss> sure , you 've had it over and over again , you know its intricacies , you 've interpreted , and digested its offerings . <sssss> and then something happens that shocks you . <sssss> you get sick of it . <sssss> so , you stash it away , lose it on your memory 's playback , and banish it from your favorite playlist . <sssss> sometime later , it comes up again , and you think ... `` oh yeahhhh ! '' <sssss> this is delux . <sssss> so you go back , get your usual pint of anchor steam , your maytag burger , and the halfer of sweet potato/boring potato fries . <sssss> then you wonder why you ever shunned it . <sssss> this shit is great . <sssss> i wo n't ever dismiss it again . <sssss> pretty soon , it will be a classic and you 'll hear everyone talk stories about it , how they were there in 1972 when delux opened for the kinks .
?		being in the fortuitous position to still ` get ' a spring break , and moreover , get paid cash-money to sit on my happy ass whilst my pen-salesman-esque friends do important things in their offices , like make fake wiki entries of their co-workers and cruise just barely sfw sites , i decided to buck my usual trend of waiting for something magnificent on the toob like gailic rules football on setanta or maybe even a little afternoon `` drinking game family feud '' and treck on over to phoenix 's most alluring dromedary . <sssss> fuck me . <sssss> it was harder than i ever thought . <sssss> those bic bitches that are my friends apparently scale this shit like doctor octopus in their free time after work , and here i am with my seldom-used nalgene bottle pushing my 190 pound frame up a very large vertical fucking rock like a goddam broken-legged donkey . <sssss> my unfairly fit girlfriend is doing cartwheels and all kinds of shit up the mountain and i 'm waving her ahead , bound to my ship like captain smith on the sinking titanic ; `` go ahead ... ca n't move ... leave me here ... go ... dying . '' <sssss> of course , after countless pre-teens and lawyer types with their kerchiefed labradors bounce right by me , i decide to pulley myself up using a carefully constructed mechanism that included my camera-string , a small boulder , and the aforementioned nalgene bottle loop . <sssss> i navigate most of the way up , i think , before my better half comes waving down the mountain . <sssss> all hope for an everest-like heroic push gone , i make my way back down again , promising to make up for my misgivings at happy hour , which i do . <sssss> my epic failure to summit , what amounts to a boulder in the hiking world , has led me to curse camelback from my balcony vantagepoint , mocking me in the smoggy distance like moby dick to my ishmael . <sssss> still , it was pretty cool and ca n't wait to go back !
?		prices are amazing and staff is super friendly ! <sssss> after going there a 3rd/4th time , i was remembered by one of the staff at the front desk . <sssss> oh , and they have signs that say they arrest minors which merits a 6th star on my rating = -rrb-
?		they have beer , it 's exceptionally good beer , and they brew it on the premise so they 're not going to run out . <sssss> it 's an even better bar to go hang out at during the asu off-season . <sssss> oh , and bejesus , their arizona chicken rolls are phenomenal ! <sssss> wish they 'd give a little more for what they charge for them but that 's not going to stop me from ordering them . <sssss> these are deliciously spicy and no idea what that white sauce is i dip them in but it 's good -lrb- insert that 's what she said here -rrb-
?		omfg , i love sushi ! <sssss> sushi bar with tvs , regular dining area , and a section setup for teppanyaki . <sssss> it 's great sushi at a great price .
?		yum ! <sssss> i have driven by this place so many times and finally met a coworker here for lunch last month . <sssss> the decor is a little dated , but still nice . <sssss> we were welcomed by the staff and the service was excellent . <sssss> the prices were really reasonable , the portions were generous and the food was absolutely delicious . <sssss> the beef kabob was moist and flavorful and served with everything i like . <sssss> i will definitely be back !
?		what a wonderful surprise for lunch today ! <sssss> this place is just beautiful and we were able to sit out on the patio for a fantastic lunch ! <sssss> we both had the jardin sandwich - zucchini , sun dried tomatoes , brie and pesto . <sssss> it came with a side of green beans , carrots and cauliflower mixed in a wonderful mustard sauce . <sssss> the inside of the restaurant is so cozy and quaint as well - lots of wood and chandeliers above every table ! <sssss> i highly recommend this place .
?		great decor , great service and great food ! <sssss> the meatloaf and the tacos were fantastic - great flavors and reasonable prices for a nice place !
?		really this is a 3.5 star place , but i 'll give it the benefit of the doubt with 4 stars . <sssss> great decor and feel to this place , great happy hour , great service , but the food was just ok . <sssss> i tried the house dynamite with chicken ... i did n't like that the chicken was breaded/fried and the sauce was just uncomfortably spicy that it made it unenjoyable . <sssss> did n't like that they charge you for rice when clearly the meal needs it too ! <sssss> would definitely come back for cocktails though ... the lust martini was delish !
?		what a great place ! <sssss> the food was beyond fresh and so flavorful . <sssss> we sat at the bar and watched the 3 chefs create the fantastic food right before us . <sssss> the pork chop was amazing served with fresh peaches and corn and the special squash blossom appetizer was delicious . <sssss> great service in a quaint atmosphere !
?		great sports bar in downtown phoenix ! <sssss> the servers are amazing too ! <sssss> great place to have a beer and watch sports on tv .
?		disappointing ... a long list of beers that they brew and only 3 were checked as available - what ??? <sssss> nice patio , friendly service and the wood fired pizzas looked good too , but i could n't get past the limited types of beer offered .
?		very cool place ... another great place to spend a saturday afternoon with a good lunch and good drinks !
?		such a cool place and so glad to have it downtown at cityscape ! <sssss> they have a great happy hour with $ 3 wells and 1/2 price appetizers . <sssss> the pretzels with 3 dipping sauces are amazing and worth the visit alone !
?		great german place in downtown glendale ! <sssss> the atmosphere was really nice ... not sure why they seated us in the bar when everyone else was seated in the front dining room though . <sssss> our server was very helpful in making beer and dinner recommendations . <sssss> the food was pretty good too ... i had the special kraut rouladen with potatoes and red cabbage . <sssss> the beer garden looked like a great place to spend a saturday afternoon in cooler months and i hear they have a band that plays every friday and saturday night which would be fun !
?		another place we had driven by countless times over the last many years and finally stopped in for happy hour . <sssss> we arrived right at 4pm when the bar was opening and it filled up immediately ... apparently the word is out that this place serves up an amazing happy hour ! <sssss> we enjoyed a crisp glass of white wine along with our shrimp cocktail ... best shrimp cocktail ever and the cocktail sauce should be bottled and sold - it is that good ! <sssss> the bartenders were really professional and attentive too . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back again to this valley classic .
?		this place is great ! <sssss> the space is amazing ... separate dining room , bar and huge outdoor beer garden/patio . <sssss> looks like a great place to spend a saturday or sunday drinking beer and watching football ! <sssss> the service was quick and friendly and the food was good ... other than the pretzel - too dry and overcooked . <sssss> the sweet brat with sauerkraut was really tasty and they make their own mustard in - house = yummy ! <sssss> the beer selection is pretty extensive too ... pretty much something for everyone !
?		i was n't sure what to expect at this place as i have never eaten cambodian food , but was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> the staff was nice , the interior was better than i expected and the food was quite tasty . <sssss> the roll was fresh and delicious ... a great way to start your meal . <sssss> i highly recommend the beef skewers ... flavorful and a little sweet at the end . <sssss> check this place out ... unique dining experience in phoenix !
?		yum ... this place is great ! <sssss> we went for the salad , pizza and 2 glasses of wine for $ 20 ... what a steal ! <sssss> good service , convenient location and great food !
?		great new addition to the biltmore area ! <sssss> i knew it had to be good when i heard it was the same group that did citizen public house ! <sssss> amazing service , great decor/atmosphere , lively crowd , and delicious food . <sssss> we started with the roasted brussel sprouts over grits - truly amazing ... bursting with flavor and the grits were ridiculously creamy . <sssss> i enjoyed the chicken ... moist and amazingly flavorful - only wish it was served with a veggie too ! <sssss> my husband tried the meatloaf and was pleased with his choice ... not amazing , but solid . <sssss> looking forward to coming back for happy hour at the bar sometime to enjoy one of the martinis that looked so good !
?		this place never gets old ... i love everything about it . <sssss> you feel like you are walking into a genuine french bistro ... amazing food , great location in kierland commons and great staff . <sssss> our bartender this past visit was amazing ... great personality and he hooked us with drinks .
?		this place is a hidden gem in scottsdale ! <sssss> the food is farm to market fresh with an every changing menu . <sssss> it is byob , so you can bring the wine that suits your party and they provide the appropriate stemware . <sssss> the food , atmosphere and service were impeccable !
?		we went on opening night and had a great experience . <sssss> it was as if the restaurant had been there for years - very well run . <sssss> the zinburger with manchego cheese is amazing ... yummy ! <sssss> everything fox touches seems to turn to gold ... yet another great concpet .
?		this place is surprisingly good ... the fry bread could really melt in your mouth ... it was that good ! <sssss> i had driven by this place so many times and finally stopped in yesterday . <sssss> i ca n't tell you how much i have been missing the past 6 years !
?		sad to see so many average reviews . <sssss> i was so excited to see chris bianco opening another restaurant in phoenix , so had to check it out . <sssss> the atmosphere is country rustic , the service was friendly and the food was quite good . <sssss> the spinach and swiss chard ravioli in brown butter was quite tasty ! <sssss> this location has never seemed to do to well , but with the addition of whole foods that should help !
?		what a truly pleasant surprise ... good food in a car wash/convenience store ... who would have thought ? <sssss> the service was amazing ... very helpful and right there when you needed it ! <sssss> nice , relaxing atmosphere that honestly did n't feel like you were eating in a car wash/convenience store . <sssss> the bbq platter with a 1/4 chicken , macaroni salad and potato salad was quite tasty , but way too big of a portion for me ! <sssss> they recommended a few different sauces for me and they were both delicious . <sssss> we 'll be back !
?		i have driven by this place so many times and always say i am going to stop in ... well , we finally did ! <sssss> the food was quite good , but the service was definitely lacking . <sssss> they were more interested in talking to each other instead of serving customers . <sssss> the decor was standard and i did n't like that you could see the kitchen ... since all they did was talk to each other instead of cook .
?		i love the fact that this is a steelers football bar ... definitely makes me a fan ! <sssss> we watched the game this morning with steelers fans and enjoyed $ 3 iron city beer in the can and free yellow jello shots - not a bad way to spend a sunday morning !
?		decent , consistent mexican food !
?		definite dive bar , but i kinda liked it in a weird sort of way ! <sssss> the bartender was friendly and the clientele was interesting ... definitely good people watching . <sssss> cheap beer too !
?		love , love , love this place ! <sssss> atmosphere is the best ... beautifully designed interior and great patio with exquisite views . <sssss> well mixed cocktails ... try the strawberry thyme royal ... you wo n't be sorry . <sssss> great service too !
?		this is my second favorite restaurant in phoenix -lrb- behind only tarbell 's -rrb- and receives consistently phabulous reviews . <sssss> i have had much on their menu and have loved almost all . <sssss> i have become a `` pho aficionado '' and i love the strong flavors in the best phos . <sssss> cyclo 's pho leaves a lot to be desired ! <sssss> broth is generally too thin , although the service is beautifully done . <sssss> plus their pho is expensive when compared to other `` pho joints '' that i believe have better pho . <sssss> everything else i have eaten on their menu -lrb- and i have eaten most everything ! <sssss> -rrb- is indeed phabulous , so i will just go elsewhere for my pho phix ! <sssss> besides , i would miss not seeing justina -lrb- cyclo owner -rrb- who is a delightful experience , not to mention the delightful experiences available on their menu , other than the pho !!
?		most impressed as i have been to the proprietors parents pizza restaurant -lrb- twice -rrb- in ahwatukee and find it to be not very good with all of the flavors much to heavy . <sssss> this experience was very different and maybe even extraordinary . <sssss> almost flaky crust , not nearly as thin as i like it , but done very nicely as a compliment to the toppings and not an overpowering plaza for them to sit on . <sssss> the potato pizza was to die for as was mushroom pizza -lrb- fungi -rrb- each with their distinctive flavors and all of the flavors of the various ingredients were allowed to come through , as opposed to just a mélange of flavor . <sssss> the calamari and shrimp -lrb- fried -rrb- appetizer was excellent also , although not a very big portion . <sssss> i am converted !
?		longing for a juicy -lrb- greasy ! <sssss> -rrb- burger ? <sssss> well here it is , in one of the valley 's four new smashburger locations ! <sssss> juicy , juicy , juicy ! <sssss> nice taste . <sssss> probably the closest to my favorite -lrb- `` steak and shake '' - none in the valley or west of texas -rrb- i have had . <sssss> opted for the 1/2 pound and it is too big . <sssss> big question is - worth more than twice the price -lrb- $ 4.99 for 1/3 pound and $ 5.99 for 1/2 pound -rrb- as for `` in and out '' double-double and unfortunately the answer is no , i do n't think so . <sssss> much like fudruckers , which i would rate ahead of smashburger for taste , it will be a `` once in a while place '' for me . <sssss> the `` haystack onion rings '' were to die for , but a very small order , that without a sandwich are priced at a very pricey $ 2.99 -lrb- $ 1.99 with a sandwich -rrb- ! <sssss> excellent ! <sssss> very clean , lots of help and nicely done , but prices are a bit much for fast food hamburger .
?		just when i thought i was finished discovering new -lrb- for me -rrb- `` pho joints '' in phoenix metro , i had to hit one more -lrb- now up to 13 visited ! <sssss> -rrb- and wow , a very big winner . <sssss> broth that rivaled dragonfly -lrb- my # 1 -rrb- and pho ao sen -lrb- my very close # 2 -rrb- , with lots of very tasty meat and the usual accompaniments . <sssss> i much prefer broth with a bold flavor and this one fits the bill . <sssss> upscale location that was very busy during lunch with lots of `` pho '' being served to vietnamese and other patrons . <sssss> i guess at $ 7.50 per bowl a bargain for `` pho '' with this quality taste !
?		great gelato . <sssss> it 's actually very creamy so kinda taste more like an ice cream but still incredible . <sssss> lots of flavors probably 30 + . <sssss> have n't had a bad one yet . <sssss> love the roche , chocolate and pistachio . <sssss> just had a pizza last visit - they have a new pizza oven . <sssss> good thin crust , tasty ingredients , soggy in the middle kind of like pomo . <sssss> give it a try !
?		very good , healthy food . <sssss> had the spinach roll ups w / chicken . <sssss> they were very tasty . <sssss> came with a side of hot sauce . <sssss> the real star was the grilled vegetables as the side order . <sssss> great flavor ! <sssss> carrots , broccoli , onions and mushrooms with a grilled flavor that was amazing.i could of just eaten a bowl of this it was soooo good . <sssss> chocolate cake pretty good but you could taste the sugar granules . <sssss> wife had soup -lrb- chicken orzo -rrb- and salad and said it was very good . <sssss> cool coke machine here to get your fountain drinks . <sssss> i had iced tea which was good . <sssss> will definitely return as i want to try the chicken kabobs . <sssss> update : had the chicken kabobs several times now . <sssss> 2 skewers w / rice and salad - best meal around for under $ 10 . <sssss> zoes is our new fav spot !
?		everything here is great . <sssss> i 've had the salads -lrb- fav is parm crusted chicken -rrb- . <sssss> had the sandwiches and pasta also which are awesome . <sssss> soup is good . <sssss> have n't had the pizza cause i usually eat that at pomo , sauce or grimaldi 's . <sssss> anyway , if you are in the mall this is some of the best food there cause food court is awful .
?		had the tortilla soup for a starter - awesome ! <sssss> wife had an asian salad and enjoyed it . <sssss> i had the skirt steak on top of some veggies . <sssss> would def get it again . <sssss> for dessert had the rum cake , it was good but not warm all the way through . <sssss> they needed to heat it longer . <sssss> overall a nice restaurant and we enjoyed it . <sssss> we like the kierland area and walking around before or after dinner .
?		love this place . <sssss> the atmosphere is so adorable . <sssss> i would highly recommend it for a girls night out , a date , maybe rent it out or see what they can do for an engagement party or rehearsal dinner . <sssss> it 's just such a cool little place , with lots of delicious wine and food options . <sssss> i would also highly recommend making a reservation because it can get packed , and the wait can be in excess of an hour ... easily . <sssss> valet is available , or about twelve spots on the street .
?		this seems like it would be a cool experience , and i can see why people would be stoked on it , but it 's just not for me . <sssss> when i hear `` leather recliners '' i 'm thinking plush lazy boy chairs and that is not what i got -- they have reclining and office chairs , both were uncomfortable for two hours . <sssss> but it is fun to go and check out , especially if you have never been to a place like this before , but if you 've been to any of the other 21 + movie theatres , like the lux theatres in californis , this will be a total disappointment . <sssss> i 'm not saying do n't go , i 'm just saying it was n't what i expected and i probably wo n't be going back . <sssss> also , i got the groupon for a movie and free soda and they tried to charge me for the sodas , but i only had to remind them once and the charges came right off .
?		finally , a southeast asian food pulse around cenpho . <sssss> when i first moved here , one of the things i noticed was how few choices there were when it comes to asian cuisine . <sssss> so nice to see something a little less common like cambodian food get represented . <sssss> the spring rolls are a must . <sssss> for $ 2 , you get a very heavily stuffed roll of rice paper touting chicken , shrimp , cilantro , carrots , etc. . <sssss> the beef salad is also a winner . <sssss> the seafood soup is flavorful and just might literally nourish the soul . <sssss> the sandwiches with the pork pate are a great lunch choice . <sssss> one day , i got one plus a roll to go -- all under $ 6 . <sssss> of the desserts , everyone should try the sweet and salty corn at least once . <sssss> the tapioca is my favorite . <sssss> light and warm . <sssss> the best part about eating here is knowing that your money is going toward a very genuine and kind cambodian family . <sssss> i have spoken with the chef/owner 's son every time i go in . <sssss> a real sweet guy who will demonstrate how to play the xylophone-esque instrument that is the centerpiece of the main dining room . <sssss> speaking of , i love all the touches of decor i.e. travel books on cambodia at every table . <sssss> i really , really hope this place does not go the way of some mom-and-pop operations in phoenix that had really great things to offer . <sssss> i 've been disturbed by the lack of customers i 've seen a few times . <sssss> i want this restaurant to really succeed . <sssss> i do n't want the lines out the door -lrb- otherwise i ca n't get in . <sssss> ;p -rrb- but i want to see a steady stream of patrons . <sssss> this place really has a chance to be a good-size fish in a big pond . <sssss> it does n't fit a cookie-cutter mold and it 's got a fantastic bill of fare to show off .
?		whenever i find myself in the vicinity of 32nd street and indian school near lunchtime , which is pretty much if i 'm seeing my dentists nearby , i decide it 's best to stop at bertha 's for grub . <sssss> it 's inevitable to undo the good cleaning i just got . <sssss> mind as well do it with a tasty bertha 's sandwich ! <sssss> last time , i had the asparagus and havarti sandwich . <sssss> i could n't sink my teeth into it until i got back to the office . <sssss> so worth it . <sssss> the bread was perfectly toasted . <sssss> not sure where they get their bread but it was nice and thick . <sssss> the asparagus was cooked very tender , likely in olive oil . <sssss> pesto mayo was flavorful . <sssss> i think the price of about $ 7 with a bag of chips and a mini cookie is reasonable for the quality . <sssss> just typing this i wish it were nearby now . <sssss> i have n't tried any of their salads or baked goods . <sssss> but i like how they offer mini cupcakes for 75 cents . <sssss> i give bertha 's two thumbs up .
?		my good friend bacon -lrb- see review below -rrb- and his partner invited me to sunday brunch . <sssss> and going off of my first impression , i 'm a fan of this place . <sssss> i had one of their skillets -- a poached egg , filet mignon , potatoes and shitake mushrooms . <sssss> filet . <sssss> mignon . <sssss> those words alone on a brunch menu is a rare occurrence . <sssss> and i would not have thought to combine it with mushrooms i usually associate with stuff my chinese mom cooked for us growing up . <sssss> but the flavors really worked . <sssss> the meat was just right , not fall-off-the-bone tender . <sssss> the potatoes had flavor too . <sssss> and it was n't an insane portion . <sssss> $ 10 for a meal that includes pieces of filet mignon -- pretty good deal ! <sssss> in such an intimate -- but not totally cramped -- space , you can easily strike up a conversation with the owner/chef , hostess and any other staff . <sssss> all three could not have been nicer while we were there . <sssss> also , love their taste in furniture and ca n't wait 'til the weather improves and the cool patio will be available . <sssss> also , let 's hope that liquor license comes through soon !
?		i just have to add that the owners here really know the definition of good customer service . <sssss> a month ago , i took out-of-town guests for sunday brunch . <sssss> part of the reason i chose city grille was because they had a promotion where you could get a free appetizer for checking in on a smart phone . <sssss> all you had to do was show your server . <sssss> well , my server , no matter how nicely i approached the matter , kept insisting that deal was only for people who brought a print-out of an email -- even after i showed her on my phone what their own restaurant 's facebook page stated ! <sssss> she just shrugged and said `` well nobody explained it to me . '' <sssss> i do n't fault her if nobody told her . <sssss> but i do fault her for not even bothering to say anything like , `` i do n't know anything about that but let me go check with a manager '' after i showed proof . <sssss> it was n't even the appetizer but the principle of the matter . <sssss> i left a comment on the restaurant 's facebook page -- very diplomatic , not with any self-entitled overtones . <sssss> their social media person asked me to email him directly outlining what happened . <sssss> less than two days later , he wrote me , with the owner copied in , apologizing and offering to send me a gift certificate for dinner for two ! <sssss> this update is not to say `` woohoo ! <sssss> i got a free meal . '' <sssss> it 's just an appreciation for when a restaurant is willing to own up to a mistake and try to make up for it . <sssss> it also sounds like because of me , they will remember to make sure all servers are aware of promotions like that . <sssss> and when i did go back for my free meal , that same server was there , lol . <sssss> luckily i had another server who was a lot warmer and approachable .
?		my friend who used to live in denver , where i believe snooze is based , told me before they opened that the food was wonderful . <sssss> well , she was right . <sssss> i ca n't believe my good fortune that they moved into the town & country in my ` hood . <sssss> i came after a doctor 's appt because i was starving from fasting . <sssss> i sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by the friendly bartender . <sssss> another lady saw my bandage from having blood drawn and was considerate enough to ask me if i wanted a piece of toast or something . <sssss> i ended up ordering a `` flight '' of pancakes where you can order 1 of 3 different flavors . <sssss> whoever decided to offer that option is , in my opinion , a brilliant person . <sssss> i also love that they have such distinct and interesting pancake options . <sssss> i ended up noshing on carrot cake -lrb- which ended up being the fave -rrb- , sweet potato and a `` pancake of the day '' which had chocolate chips and cherries . <sssss> i got a side of the house-made chicken sausage which was amazing . <sssss> i 'm not sure what herbs they seasoned with but it looks like a pounded , cubed steak . <sssss> but it was very moist and not too salty . <sssss> i 've only been back there another time since and i exercised the half and half option for their `` art of hollandaise '' items . <sssss> another great option ! <sssss> i got to try two kinds of but the winner was the havana benny . <sssss> here 's the description : shaved niman ranch ham and slow roasted pork served over a savory swiss cheese bread pudding and topped with poached eggs , dijon hollandaise and diced house pickles . <sssss> the ham was really the winning ingredient here but all of it came together nicely . <sssss> i noticed this place draws a varying demographic . <sssss> i saw families with kids and grandmas like one would see at ihop . <sssss> but i also saw hipsters on the patio and at the bar . <sssss> i 'm not sure if the place 's popularity is at play or because it 's new , but weekends , expect an hour wait for brunch . <sssss> otherwise , try to go on a week day .
?		sprinkles knows how to make a decent cupcake . <sssss> i like the overall appearance and flavor of the cupcakes . <sssss> the cake part is insignificant and even a bit dry but the frosting is rich , thick , and divine ! <sssss> the key to eating this cupcake is having both cake and frosting in each and every bite . <sssss> they have a nice enough variety of flavors to keep you coming back for more .
?		i visited ultra star cinema with too high of expectations based upon the reviews i read . <sssss> the cafe does not feel european ... it definitely feels like you are in a movie theater that just has some added amenities . <sssss> the theater chairs are larger than normal and feel like a recliner -lrb- without putting your feet up -rrb- . <sssss> i also like how the theaters are smaller and do n't allow noisy kids due to the serving of alcohol . <sssss> just for the full experience , my husband and i ordered quesadillas from our seat with the push of a button . <sssss> they have menus on the back of the seat in front of you to order from . <sssss> overall i was impressed with my visit but i do n't know that i need my movie going experience to be all that . <sssss> i mostly go to the movies to go to see the movie . <sssss> i prefer to go out to a cafe before or after the movie instead of being charged a higher price for the movie tickets .
?		come hungry ! <sssss> the food is delicious ! <sssss> the atmosphere is cozy but chic . <sssss> the serve is exceptional . <sssss> we split the green chile pork stew wrapped in flour tortillas as an appetizer . <sssss> the meat was so tender it just falls apart in your mouth . <sssss> the pork is cooked to perfection but i have enjoyed other dishes like this better . <sssss> i had bob 's big burger with shoe string fries for my meal . <sssss> i could only eat half the burger even though it was absolutely delicious ! <sssss> i left there stuffed and with plenty of left overs to savor for another meal time . <sssss> i highly recommend going !
?		might be some of the best hot dogs i 've ever had . <sssss> thank goodness for their active participation with living social and groupon - allows me to shop here .
?		nobuo has been on my dining to do list for sometime and i am very glad that i was able to check it off . <sssss> the food was nothing but amazing ! <sssss> we started off with nasu and teeter tots . <sssss> the nasu can be served without bacon if you are a vegetarian . <sssss> we then moved on to the yellowtail ceviche and shiromi carpaccio . <sssss> the presentation of the yellowtail was perfect and the shiromi is a not to missed item . <sssss> it was exceptional ! <sssss> we finished dinner with the seabass and mushrooms . <sssss> it was perfect for myself and my husband . <sssss> he enjoyed the seabass while i focused on the mushrooms . <sssss> not only was the food great but the service was outstanding as well . <sssss> i am looking forward to returing to nobuo in the very near future and bringing a few friends !
?		one of my favorite places to dine out for a special occasion . <sssss> opted to do something different for girl 's night out and headed to different pointe of view . <sssss> we opted for the chef 's tasting menu and were thoroughly impressed ! <sssss> our first item was an amazing scallop and shaved fennel salad . <sssss> the scallop was prepared perfectly ! <sssss> this course was paired with a lovely glass of roussanne . <sssss> next we had a spectacular salad that there is no way i can do it justice by explaining it . <sssss> pears , pecans , blue cheese - trust me - amazing ! <sssss> this course was paired with a syrah rose - fun ! <sssss> moving on - halibut served with gnocchi and lobster . <sssss> again - perfect and served with a blend of viognier and marsanne . <sssss> our final dish was filet served with risotto and paired with mourvedre . <sssss> the service was outstanding and of course the view is worth every penny . <sssss> want to impress or wow a date , business partner or in-law - different pointe of view will deliver every time !
?		i have just recently discovered luke 's and mmmmmmm i am addicted ! <sssss> the best italian sandwich ever !!! <sssss> i ordered the whole because i was starving , but was defeated halfway . <sssss> i put the half in the fridge for lunch the next day and it still was amazing ! <sssss> small menu but it is definitely worth it ! <sssss> ps ... fries are really good too ! <sssss> om nom nom nom
?		after months of listening to a coworker talk about how amazing this pizza was i finally gave in and went for lunch . <sssss> i had a small pep and cheese , which was the perfect lunch size btw . <sssss> i have to admit that this crust was nothing short of amazing . <sssss> they were not shy with the toppings either , which made it even more amazing because cheese makes everything awesome . <sssss> i even found myself thinking about the crust after i left , and the next day as well . <sssss> i am not sure what they put in that pizza but i am addicted . <sssss> it would be dangerous if i lived close ... i will definitely be back .
?		my absolute favorite `` chicago '' style pizza . <sssss> the best thin crust pizza ... . <sssss> . <sssss> ever ! <sssss> i love the super crispy edges of this amazing pizza . <sssss> this place is usually pretty busy and parking well . <sssss> . <sssss> sucks . <sssss> definitely plan on being here a little longer than most restaurants you visit . <sssss> we always order the pizza cookie , formerly known as the pizzookie . <sssss> it is the absolute best thing in the world . <sssss> makes even the most horrible restaurant experience ever , into an epic treat ! <sssss> i will be back again and again .
?		okay , the name is bad -lrb- what were they thinking ? <sssss> -rrb- but the fact is ... this gelato is soooo good . <sssss> when my brother visits from out of town , he drives out of his way to go to this place for dessert every day . <sssss> if we 're out at a restaurant anywhere near this place , he always chooses to skip dessert at the restaurant just so we can have angel sweet instead . <sssss> he 's a chocolate freak too and he and i agree that the chocolate offerings at angel sweet are second to none . <sssss> unlike gelato spot , who does n't always have a pure chocolate offering -lrb- usually they have hazelnut or almond in them -rrb- , angel sweet usually has two pure chocolates that can be mixed with something else of your choice . <sssss> i love the fact that i can get two flavors of my choice even in the small size . <sssss> yay ! <sssss> so if you 're craving chocolate-covered strawberries , go for the super dark chocolate with strawberry , raspberry or any other similar fruity flavor -- the pairing is wonderful ! <sssss> also , if they have the chocolate cake batter , that 's a winner with coconut . <sssss> and while i wo n't say that it 's the best gelato i 've ever had -- that goes to glace faite maison in ille . <sssss> st. louis in paris -- but i will drive out of my way to indulge .
?		the chips and salsa are great in that they 're free but the taste really is n't great , so i rarely eat them ... but i do so love the pollo fundido ! <sssss> chicken is tender inside ... ample jalapeno sour cream and a little bit of cheddar -- yum .
?		i always forget to review this place ! <sssss> i 've gone for dinner 4 or 5 times in the past 3-4 yrs which makes it about once a year ... definitely good enough to return -lrb- we went last friday night -rrb- but i think the reasons i do n't return more often are : a -rrb- a bit pricey -lrb- $ 5 for a side of mushrooms is kinda crazy -rrb- b -rrb- menu is pretty limited and nothing is spectacular or even unique c -rrb- there are so many other restaurants -- especially in that chandler mall area -- that something else always wins out that being said , i 've never had a bad experience . <sssss> steaks/prime rib have always been cooked exactly as i ordered and the salmon is wonderful too . <sssss> wish the dinners came with a vegetable or salad as well as the potato but , alas ... service has always been attentive and the hosting staff never snotty . <sssss> like the dimly lit lodge look of the place as well . <sssss> yes , i would recommend this place but with price/menu caveats mentioned above .
?		saw brian setzer and his band years ago and the acoustics in the ikeda theatre were great ; setting : modern and clean . <sssss> enjoyed a smaller production at the intimate 500-seat piper theatre and it was an equally ideal venue . <sssss> helpful , friendly staff all around -lrb- i 'm assign volunteers ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> will definitely be back .
?		if i had to include `` value for the money '' as part of my rating , they 'd get 2 stars . <sssss> i gave them 3 because they 're in scottsdale and if you ca n't afford a $ 4 cupcake , then do n't go to scottsdale . <sssss> that said , i have never been bowled over by these cupcakes . <sssss> i 've tried them 4 or 5 times over the past couple of years and i always think : `` they 're just nowhere near as good as more cupcakes in chicago '' . <sssss> i guess when you 've had the best , the bar is set so high that it 's hard to top . <sssss> anyway , although i tend toward the chocolate and peanut-butter flavors , i 've tried their strawberry , vanilla , red velvet and coconut ... they are all good , just not amazing , or even great . <sssss> oh , and they really need to think about selling milk , in addition to water and juice . <sssss> nothing goes better with a cupcake than a glass of milk -lrb- imho -rrb- .
?		a good mozzarella sandwich for arizona but nowhere near the one i had back in jersey at joe leone 's in pt . <sssss> pleasant . <sssss> i had to park down the street , even on a saturday at 2pm . <sssss> paid $ 20 to take home a mozzarella/tomato & basil , and a soppressata/provalone & roasted pepper . <sssss> the hubby agreed : they were good , not great . <sssss> had to add salt & pepper to the mozz sandwich ; not a good thing ... bread is very good , but it 's that tough , rustic thin focaccia style which makes my mouth sore from chewing . <sssss> not a big fan of that . <sssss> also , they were sold out of the sandwich special of the day so that left me with exactly 3 to coose from . <sssss> not enough variety .
?		my husband and i have been going to all of pita jungle 's locations for over 13 years and the consistency , friendly service and good food was always expected and delivered . <sssss> not once have we had a bad experience . <sssss> love , love love that ahwatukee now has their own pj with ample outdoor seating . <sssss> best place for fresh , crisp iced tropical tea or a glass of wine . <sssss> great art -lrb- often for sale -rrb- on the walls and delicious pitas ... my fav 's for lunch are the chicken philly pita -lrb- ask them to add mushrooms if you like -rrb- , the red pepper hummus plate , and the lavosh schawarma wrap . <sssss> for dinner , their fresh fish dishes are always prepared in some tasty , unique way ... love the mahi mahi with pita chips and the broiled chicken salad is huge and satisfying ... yum ! <sssss> desserts are very tasty too , if you have room for some baklawa or carrot cake .
?		the kids wanted five guys but my husband and i wanted sushi ... a bunch of restaurants are all clustered here at the corner of 7th & mcdowell so we got to do both ! <sssss> sushi was n't bad . <sssss> staff was very friendly and helpful , even suggesting alternatives with our choices . <sssss> the slammin ' salmon was deelish with cucumber and strawberry . <sssss> the spicy tuna was great with asparagus . <sssss> love the concept . <sssss> not sure how quick the line moves when the place is busy but i 'd definitely go back .
?		the sushi is really , really good , 4.0 stars . <sssss> the service not great , 2.0 stars . <sssss> it is worth a try though , you never know , you might end up with some accidental hire that is actually nice , and can refill your drinks in a timely manner . <sssss> this place is a hip camelback quarter place . <sssss> not too trendy like the here today gone tomorrow scottsdale variety . <sssss> the place has been there for a long time and serves consistently good sushi . <sssss> worth a try if you are in the area , or are looking for a nicer place to dine .
?		this is one of the true arizona restaurants , and i recommend this place to anyone from out of town . <sssss> well , anyone in town too . <sssss> the staff is extremely fun and nice , which is hard to come by these days . <sssss> the food is awesome . <sssss> gigantic portions , but all the better to take home and enjoy the next day -lrb- or two ... -rrb- . <sssss> the pizza and salads are my favorite , and of course one can not forget the glutenous wonder of the pizza cookie -lrb- formerly the pzookie -rrb- . <sssss> this brings ooey gooey goodness to a whole new level . <sssss> the only downside ... its size , but that is part of their schtick . <sssss> get there early , whether it is lunch or dinner or expect to wait a long time . <sssss> trust me though , it is well worth it . <sssss> oh and parking sucks too . <sssss> again the food and service are worth it the inconvenience . <sssss> ** all the locations are great , the mesa one -lrb- one of the newest locations -rrb- is probably the worst , but i say that with a grain of salt . <sssss> it is still better than most of the restaurants out there .
?		corbin 's is the real deal ! <sssss> great food , beautiful venue , and stellar customer service . <sssss> went to lunch at corbin 's last week , and we were the first ones in on a friday . <sssss> we were warmly greeted and seated at a four top . <sssss> instantly we had our drinks and app in , and then selected lunch . <sssss> we both had the blt , with fries on the side , and it was delicious . <sssss> something like a blt should be easy to get right every time , but i am sure you have had a cruddy one in the past . <sssss> each element of the sandwich was perfect , great fresh bacon , and the rest of the elements were fresh and crisp . <sssss> i was really impressed at the amount of bacon this sandwich contained , you 'd think that would be the most expensive part of the sammie , and the first thing to skimp on - but not here . <sssss> the restaurant is really impressive looking . <sssss> polished concrete floors , custom tables with hand painted tops , steel and glass accents . <sssss> with all the contemporary stuff , it still managed to be warm and inviting , and i think that is where the human element comes in . <sssss> from the bussers to the manager , everyone was outstanding in their customer service delivery . <sssss> i find it refreshing when people are proud of their product , and the work they do . <sssss> the manager -lrb- kevin , i think -rrb- came by and asked us how our lunch was . <sssss> now , while that happens all over , he truly wanted to know , it was n't a walk-by `` heyhowwasyourlunchtoday?greatthanks ! '' <sssss> kevin answered a few questions , and then asked us our names and shook our hands . <sssss> i was really impressed with the warm , genuine service . <sssss> i highly recommend this restaurant , it is great in every aspect . <sssss> i look forward to trying it again , i hear their brunch is off the charts . <sssss> one tip , parking gets tight , but there is street parking and a lot , so you should be okay .
?		this great boutique is located in the same building as giant coffee , and like giant , is a good place to spend time & money ! <sssss> i was looking for some easter basket filler , and since buying clothes for a woman is tricky at best , i chickened out and went with a gift card , along with a random little ring shaped like a audio tape . <sssss> the employee -lrb- maybe owner ? <sssss> -rrb- was super friendly and helped make the gift card look great by wrapping it , and really went above and beyond in being helpful and nice , when this was n't the biggest sale of the day . <sssss> in looking around , bunky offers a lot of interesting and cool looking items for men and women . <sssss> i am told that the clothes are similar to what you might find at anthropologie -lrb- that did n't help me , or prob . <sssss> most guys , but maybe that helps you -rrb- in closing , grab a tasty drink from giant , then go shop at bunky . <sssss> cool selection , great customer service , and supporting local businesses . <sssss> win-win !
?		sometimes there is such thing as too much of a good thing , in this case , greetings . <sssss> much like how safeway grocery store now has this kind of forced pleasantries thing going , oreganos is at it as well . <sssss> my coworker and i were greeted warmly by the nice host . <sssss> within the next two minutes , we were welcomed/greeted probably 23 times . <sssss> i kept waiting to be asked if i was saved , or get a free copy of the watchtower . <sssss> please do n't get me wrong , i love manners , they are great - like beer , but a little goes a looooong way . <sssss> my buddy and i order lunch , a couple of slices and cheesy garlic bread . <sssss> i think i jinxed us , because i ` checked in ' with my excitement about cheesy garlic bread , and the appetizer never arrived . <sssss> our lunch arrived , and as we scan the table discover there is no silverware , napkins , etc. . <sssss> after waiting a few minutes our server shows up and sees that we have made no forward progress , and brings us our silverware , and made a comment about forgeting the silverware . <sssss> totally cool , and i thought he addressed it , but no harm done . <sssss> the server then asks if we ever got our appetizer , and we told him we did not . <sssss> his reply would have made sense if i told him the sun would rise tomorrow , `` oh . '' <sssss> kind of matter of fact , but there was no attempt at service recovery , or making it right . <sssss> i would have been really pleased with a `` oh , sorry about that . '' <sssss> or `` can i buy you guys dessert ? '' <sssss> etc. . <sssss> nope , did n't happen . <sssss> it is a good spot , and they are insanely busy during lunch , but i think it would be good for them to remember to pay attention to details , it is important . <sssss> the pizza was just ok , nothing to write home about . <sssss> i think next time i will check out nypd , they have great pie .
?		cibo is a great spot for pizza and ambiance . <sssss> like many successful places , sometimes service takes a hit - when it gets busy at peak times . <sssss> one weak link is a male server who consistently spaces out and gets orders wrong . <sssss> i am a fan of people who do n't need to write down the order , but then when you get multiple things wrong - it 's not so bueno . <sssss> luckily the food is so good , it eclipses occasional sub-par service . <sssss> i recommend the diavola pizza with anti-pasta to start . <sssss> enjoy .
?		the ideal customer for this store is someone who is heavily armed and who has the patience of ghandi . <sssss> you would need both to safely navigate the waters of this disastrous store . <sssss> this is the nearest grocer for downtown residents , and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin . <sssss> on any day , the parking lot is covered in grease , coffee , and trash . <sssss> if by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers , then the heavens are smiling on you . <sssss> once inside the store , your adventure is just starting . <sssss> the characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in star wars . <sssss> very random and sketchy . <sssss> as far as the contents of the store , to be fair they have all the stuff you need , and at a reasonable price point . <sssss> the huge problem here , is everything else . <sssss> during peak hours , they have very few lanes open , that is a consistent failure with this store . <sssss> customer service is also dead here , and they just do n't know how to take care of customers . <sssss> i feel as though the broken window theory is at play here . <sssss> it seems like because they do n't take care of the parking lot , and other details , the whole place goes to hell . <sssss> the store also has a serious shoplifting problem . <sssss> i 'm not sure if they just do n't staff the loss prevention unit , or if they are inept , but i have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief . <sssss> it makes for an unsafe situation for everyone . <sssss> they do have private security there , and the guys seem really nice , but clearly in over their heads . <sssss> at this point the store is so far gone , they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe . <sssss> it really seems like this store just does n't give a shit . <sssss> at each opportunity to impress , the complete opposite happens . <sssss> this place is a huge safety problem , and i would hate to have my sisters or mom go to this place , it 's really that shady . <sssss> see for yourself , but be on your toes .
?		i grew up in the area , and was a fan of lucky boy , and then it changed owners , and the quality sucked , so i retired its jersey . <sssss> after reading here on yelp that lucky boy was back to its full glory , i had to see for myself . <sssss> i hit the drive thru on a thursday afternoon , and the service was quick , friendly , and efficient . <sssss> getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing , and side of fries , i went home . <sssss> i was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than ever ! <sssss> tasty burgers , with a nice char taste , and they pay attention to details , which is great . <sssss> tasty fresh lettuce , tomatoes , onions , piled on a grilled bun makes for a great meal . <sssss> lucky boy v1 .0 had kind of weak fries , they were trying to be fresh and simple , but they were bland and tasteless . <sssss> lucky boy v2 .0 uses frozen fries , and does a great job of cooking them perfectly . <sssss> just an fyi , the inside of lucky boy is very , very small . <sssss> cute , but small , so if you have a large group , this may be a better take out spot . <sssss> i also had a strawberry malt , which was very tasty . <sssss> i look forward to putting lucky boy back in the rotation . <sssss> i think it 's really cool to have really good food , locally owned at good prices . <sssss> i know the 5 guys vs. in-n-out war rages on , but i will stick with lucky boy !
?		dear every other carne asada spot in the 602 , it 's not you - it 's me , not liking you anymore . <sssss> sonora mesquite grill is so flavorful and delicious , it makes me grateful i was n't chosen to go to heaven for the rapture . <sssss> as others have mentioned , the carne asada is the star here . <sssss> well , that and the service . <sssss> to say this place is sweet and the people are charming , is the understatement of the year . <sssss> this place is owned by a mother and her son , and both times i have been there , they have been just outstanding . <sssss> today i phoned in a takeout order , and the mom would answer with ` yes dear ' in the sweetest , non-condescending way ever . <sssss> she literally exudes warmth , and it is not only in her customer service , but also her food . <sssss> the carne asada burro is tremendous . <sssss> it comes with beans and rice in the burro , but i am a purist , and i ask for those items on the side , as i just want to taste carne goodness in the burro . <sssss> if you order chips and salsa you get a few different salsas , a verde , rojo , and thicker rojo . <sssss> the salsas are so delicious and tasty - you can taste the freshness and care that goes into it . <sssss> in fact , the salsas are so amazing , if i ran out of chips - i would dip lucky charms cereal into the salsa , because anything that good you can not waste ! <sssss> the restaurant is small , but impeccably clean , and care is taken throughout the establishment to keep guests comfortable . <sssss> the food is very , very good , and it is so cool to have business owners so proud of their product , and at sonora mesquite grill - they have much to proud of . <sssss> also not to be missed is their fresh made lemonade . <sssss> i read here on yelp that it was tasty - and my fellow yelpers did not let me down . <sssss> it is very fresh and tasty - without being too sweet . <sssss> the only thing i am curious about is that they serve bagged tortilla chips , as opposed to making them fresh . <sssss> not the end of the world , just kind of curious . <sssss> i would recommend if they ca n't make their own , to consider using the ` my nanas ' chips , or another type which is more consistent with mexican restaurants . <sssss> this is just minutia , and does n't change anything , the place is just that good . <sssss> try for yourself , you will not be disappointed . <sssss> ciao !
?		aj 's is arizona 's finest grocery store , without exception . <sssss> i love shopping at aj 's because not only am i shopping local , i am also getting great items that are hard to find elsewhere . <sssss> this aj 's has literally every option you can imagine , from fresh baked pizza to amazing sushi served to order . <sssss> i love aj 's because they allow the employees to be themselves and not be so corporate and only speak off a script . <sssss> employees are the cornerstone of aj 's and they rock . <sssss> my only complaint about this aj 's , is really not about aj 's at all , it is about the weird , cranky customers . <sssss> there are regular non-crusty people , but every time i go , i also see some nasty mean people , totally being jerks to the staff . <sssss> listen , i get it , you 're important , you have a range rover , you 're wearing lulu lemon pants , i understand . <sssss> the thing is , these employees work hard , and do n't need you barking orders at them as if they are marine corps recruits . <sssss> also , if they are out of something this is not a personal attack on you , so chill the f out . <sssss> keep up the good work aj 's , we love you !
?		i finally got to try this place out . <sssss> after years of knowing about it and not doing anything about that i got my day . <sssss> meat ! <sssss> lots and lots of delicious meat ! <sssss> the salad bar was great , but i knew that i did n't come here for that . <sssss> i tried my best to be brief at the bar , but i could n't resist . <sssss> wonderful selection of veggies and cheeses . <sssss> smoked salmon as well . <sssss> the hearts of palm were crunchy , the artichoke hearts were wonderful . <sssss> i was in love , but i was ready for meat . <sssss> first they clear your plate and throw down some side dishes . <sssss> truthfully none of the sides looked tempting . <sssss> it was a small portion , but i bet if we wanted more , we 'd get it . <sssss> the second you flip that button to allow meat , they come running over . <sssss> skewers upon skewers of meat . <sssss> all of them were wonderful but some were better than others . <sssss> stay away from the bacon wrapped filet and parmesan crusted pork . <sssss> both were not that good . <sssss> i also noticed that i prefer the meat when it 's straight out of the flame . <sssss> if it sits around more than 15 minutes , it 's not as good . <sssss> what i really liked about the place was the service . <sssss> top notch . <sssss> they let us know right away that they work as a team . <sssss> so if we did n't see the server that first waited on us , we could ask anyone . <sssss> that was true . <sssss> there were about 6 people helping us at all times . <sssss> what i did n't like about the place was i felt a little rushed . <sssss> the rest of my party was done eating and i was still trucking . <sssss> not only did they clear the table while i was still eating , the waiter even presented the desserts . <sssss> dessert was the last thing on my mind while they were still bringing me meat . <sssss> however the dessert -lrb- if you can make it -rrb- were spectacular . <sssss> we had the creme brule and the molten chocolate cake . <sssss> both were fabulous . <sssss> overall , i 'd come back here again and again and again . <sssss> it was wonderful
?		i feel bad giving this place such a low rating when one of my good friends fiance used to work here . <sssss> we went for my birthday and it was subpar . <sssss> the cut of steak was nice , the ambiance was nice , the server was nice , but the food did not meet my standards . <sssss> when i am paying $ 40 for a steak , i want a $ 40 steak . <sssss> i have had better for $ 5.99 steak in las vegas . <sssss> i will not be dining here again because i am not getting my money 's worth . <sssss> on a side note , the bartender tatum was a joke . <sssss> no personality , no help what so ever . <sssss> when we asked for a recommendation on a glass of wine , she said `` i do n't know '' she took a while to greet us at the bar and it was not crowded . <sssss> i guess polishing glasses is more important . <sssss> is n't the bar where the customer get 's their first impression ?
?		i debated between giving this place either 3 stars or 4 stars . <sssss> i think if they needed to make 1 major improvement it would be a better system of getting cars into the establishment . <sssss> on a saturday night , you will be waiting in line for 20 minutes . <sssss> the screens are fine . <sssss> i do n't think it 's going to get any better . <sssss> for $ 6 you get 2 movies . <sssss> you can bring your own food and drink . <sssss> the best part about it all , the snack bar is dirt cheap . <sssss> you can get a jumbo sized popcorn for $ 5 . <sssss> it does n't get any better than that . <sssss> i would n't see a big budget action movie like transformers here but a comedy or a popcorn flick , this is the best way to go .
?		i love chompies . <sssss> i really do . <sssss> just stay far far away from this place on sunday morning / afternoon . <sssss> the place is incredibly understaffed . <sssss> table for 3 with a baby . <sssss> told us it would take 15 minutes to sit . <sssss> it took more like 30 . <sssss> we sit down . <sssss> we wait 5 minutes , no waitress . <sssss> a table next to us get 's seated . <sssss> they get greeted , get their drinks then get their food order taken . <sssss> then the same waitress comes over and takes our order . <sssss> so now we 've waited 30 minutes to be sat and 15 minutes to have a waitress come to our table . <sssss> i ask for 1 scrambled egg to come for the baby as soon as it 's ready . <sssss> 10 minutes later a manager comes to the table with our egg . <sssss> it 's undercooked and cold . <sssss> very mushy . <sssss> you would think being the manager , he 's qualified to take a look at a scrambled egg and know this is undercooked . <sssss> it was quite obvious . <sssss> i send it back . <sssss> 20 minutes later our food comes out . <sssss> still no egg . <sssss> i ask the food runner . <sssss> she comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate -lrb- a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes -rrb- if the egg was for me , i would have sent it back . <sssss> but it 's for a baby and i would have cooled it down before i fed him . <sssss> the food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order . <sssss> if we wanted water or extra napkins , i got up and got it myself . <sssss> this is n't my first rodeo . <sssss> my wife had her baby shower here on a sunday and we got the same crappy service . <sssss> i need to remind myself to stop coming here on sundays .
?		the only reason i will go back is if a band comes to town that i can not miss . <sssss> i 'll start with the good . <sssss> security is so friendly . <sssss> my friend proposed to his girlfriend and they were so helpful into making it happen . <sssss> if they kick you out , you deserve it !! <sssss> parking sucks . <sssss> it costs money to park and they do n't have many spaces . <sssss> you have to get early to park and it 's really the only good parking around the venue . <sssss> sound is meh . <sssss> i 've heard better , not often do i hear worse . <sssss> drinks are a rip off !!!! <sssss> either do n't drink , come there drunk or sneak booze in -lrb- i do n't support sneaking it in . <sssss> they do pat you down as you enter -rrb- so what we have here is a rip off establishment that is one of the only places in town to see national touring acts . <sssss> fuck it .
?		dos has fallen far from it 's old tempe trailer park !!! <sssss> i used to always hang at the dos in tempe on university dr just a step away from the asu campus and mill ave. it was always i nice laided back place with a great atmosphere . <sssss> now they want to be a big chain and there is no longer $ 2 corona 's all day everyday like it used to be , now dos is some crappy bar/club . <sssss> i was doing a search on youtube and came accross a video that was taken at this place , you can find it yourself by typing -lrb- dos gingos bouncer -rrb- in this video there was a drunk guy small harmless guy yelling obsivley not going to do anything and then this dushbag bouncer punched this extreamly drunk guy knocked him out cold , then the bouncer jumps around beatting his chest yelling woo woo , what a joke ! <sssss> the guy should not be called a bouncer because it 's not there job to harm customers even if they are dumb drunk . <sssss> the video is pretty funny though . <sssss> but it just shows that dos gringos is not the laid back place it used to be .
?		yeah two stars -lrb- read all -rrb- my first game here was against the cubs , cubs won . <sssss> good thing i 'm a cubs fan . <sssss> i used to live in tempe and would come to the ball park when i could and catch a game . <sssss> i never really liked the ball park , it seemed like a movie theater , being a cubs fan and having been to wrigley , chase field back then bank one ball park was kind of a joke to me . <sssss> then i move back to the midwest . <sssss> now that i 've been to a few other ball parks i realized that chase field is a cookie cutter ball park , it 's the same as minute maid -lrb- astros -rrb- without the train and the same as miller park -lrb- brewers -rrb- with out the yellow slide for bernie . <sssss> the good things about chase field . <sssss> i was there when the diamondbacks won game 7 and the world series ! <sssss> it was a fun time but people in tempe mostly asu students started a riot on mill ave witch was pretty fun . <sssss> although i did n't like the fact that a guy kicked a cops knee in . <sssss> i came back out for a visit -lrb- friends wedding -rrb- . <sssss> when it was playoff time chicago cubs vs arizona , i had some alright seats , would have never got seats like that for that price in chicago ! <sssss> the other thing that bothers me about my last visit to chase field game 2 of the playoffs against the cubs was there was some dork behind me trying to talk trash , which would have been fine but he did n't know half the players on the field -lrb- i 'm being nice , i think he knew two players -rrb- or anything about baseball ! <sssss> that was the thing that bothered me about phoenix in general that people only come out when there team was winning , if i only had a team in my city -lrb- cedar rapids , ia -rrb- i 'd be there every game ! <sssss> please make this a better place by actually being a fan ! <sssss> if your going to talk trash then know more then two people on your team ! <sssss> and a little about baseball . <sssss> if you do n't know that much then just watch and learn the game !
?		this place seems like a nice little neighborhood bar , my buddy lives down the street and goes here a lot , they did n't seem to have a lot for a beer selection compaired to some other tavern 's in the area but the appetizers and food are good . <sssss> we had really good service , the asu vs u of a game was on -lrb- bb -rrb- and there was about a 50 , 50 split witch seemed odd since this is in phx not tuscan but it 's worked out asu won so things were good ! <sssss> i will most likely find myself at this tavern again on my next visit !
?		i 've been to 5th and wine twice now and have enjoyed both visits . <sssss> the most recent was a weekend lunch . <sssss> their wine deals are great a $ 5 a glass , and their lunch menu was good . <sssss> i had the egg sandwich , which was great , the husband had the elk burger . <sssss> can i just take a second here to talk about spicy raspberry jalapeno ketchup ? <sssss> this is a condiment people need to know about , and i feel it is my duty to get the word out there . <sssss> it came on the elk burger , and we requested a side . <sssss> sweet potato fries and spicy raspberry jalapeno ketchup were simply meant to be together . <sssss> they are culinary soul mates . <sssss> quick friendly service , good food and drinks , good prices . <sssss> happy camper .
?		oh hula 's the first time we came in a noticed the spicy shrimp caesar . <sssss> i thought mango in a caesar was a pretty odd choice . <sssss> i tried it thinking that the two really did n't go together but was pleasantly surprised ! <sssss> the next trip i ordered the jerk pork . <sssss> holy pig . <sssss> seriously , this pork was melt in your mouth tender . <sssss> chewing was hardly necessary . <sssss> the flavor was really really good . <sssss> all of the sides were delicious , the fried plantains were just right and the jamaican johnny cakes were passed around our table for everyone to try . <sssss> out of all the guests we have taken with us no one has ever left disappointed . <sssss> we have yet to run into anything mediocre and always look forward to our next trip .
?		we needed a break from st.patties festivities , and some food , and one of my fav yelpers nader suggested cherryblossom . <sssss> you ca n't beat this happy hour . <sssss> a beer for under $ 3 , various appetizers for $ 2 , $ 3 , and $ 4 . <sssss> nader raved about the spicy gyoza hot pot , so freaking good . <sssss> i got the tantan-men , spicy noodles with minced pork . <sssss> i like pork in all it 's forms , and this was good . <sssss> i 'm a sucker for ramen , and this is a great place for a fix ! <sssss> the sushi , was ok , not show stopping . <sssss> great place for happy hour !
?		they now deliver . <sssss> i really love them .
?		i like sunup . <sssss> i like the beer , its good , i especially love the ipa . <sssss> oddly enough , i have yet to eat at sunup . <sssss> i just really like that this is a nice place to kick back and have a cold one . <sssss> the services is consistently quick and friendly , and the selection is great .
?		i am lucky enough to live very near by this thai place . <sssss> we have it almost weekly when i refuse to cook . <sssss> we have tried the yellow curry , pad thai , thai toast , and the pa-naeng curry . <sssss> i have yet to be disappointed . <sssss> the prices are good , the portions are large -lrb- i always share a meal with my husband and then have lunch the next day -rrb- and the staff is very friendly .
?		i finally caught up with these guys at the phoenix market . <sssss> i really love the soft flat bread they use as buns , its wonderful . <sssss> and the owner , could n't be nicer . <sssss> my experience was really a positive one . <sssss> the dog i had with the mango chutney on it was great , the one with blue cheese , cole slaw , and barbecue sauce was surprisingly good as well . <sssss> i hope to catch them at shadys in the future !
?		i like pad thai . <sssss> i really do . <sssss> and that is about as much as i know about thai food . <sssss> that being said , i do like touch of thai . <sssss> the staff is always friendly and the food is always tasty . <sssss> however , there are two shrimp on my pad thai . <sssss> only one when my husband takes his shrimp that i am pretty sure were written into our vows when we wed. . <sssss> it went something like ... `` in sickness and health , to always give me a shrimp off your plate , till death do us part '' anyway , a couple more would n't kill them . <sssss> also , the place is kind of ... well ... run down ? <sssss> the decor is a bit out of date , there are strange stains in strange places ... the bathroom is ... well , not nearly as bad as a gas station in blythe , but not awesome either . <sssss> but , the food is good . <sssss> a little mild , come on guys i can handle it .
?		went for their buffet last week , and sadly did n't have any sort of memorable experience . <sssss> the most impressive dishes were the potato cauliflower dish , and the drink . <sssss> naan was boring , spiciness of the meat dishes lacked flavor to make them complex . <sssss> perhaps it is just that i have been spoiled by the amazing indian food i have had elsewhere , but this just did not stack up . <sssss> to be fair , i have never ordered off this restaurant 's menu , so perhaps their cooked to order fare is more impressive , but the lunch buffet was just not doing it for me . <sssss> price was reasonable , so at least there was no sticker shock to add insult to injury .
?		i am worried about my own lifestyle looking back at how many burger joints i have frequented in the last month . <sssss> but at least they are quality , so i can live with it for now ... with places like this in town , why are fast food places still alive ? <sssss> seriously , the brainwashers really have a foothold , because anything else , i just ca n't wrap my head around . <sssss> this place is great . <sssss> the owner is a real , genuine dude who loves what he does . <sssss> the burger and fries were fantastic . <sssss> the bacon on it was glorious and the cheese was perfect . <sssss> i got the cheddar , but will try swiss next time i have a burger . <sssss> the beef is perfection on a bun . <sssss> fries , crispy potato savory heaven . <sssss> i am not a mayo guy , so `` secret sauce '' always has me skeeved . <sssss> . <sssss> but the owner told me to try it on the side . <sssss> it was okay , and spiced well , hint of cumin , ketchup , mayo . <sssss> i 'm still a ketchup purist , but the sauce was n't a deal breaker.the place is the real deal . <sssss> i am going back and will update after i have the italian beef . <sssss> somedays , you just regret that you only have one stomach .
?		i like steve 's . <sssss> the sign is wierd and i get visions of freddy kruger when i pass the place , but the coffee is good . <sssss> local stuff . <sssss> the place is good for working . <sssss> first time i went in i got kinda `` my sh * % do n't stink '' kinda vibe from the barista . <sssss> it is kinda offputting , so i stayed away for a bit , but have gone back and have n't had any issues . <sssss> i prefer solo down the street , but when i am here and it 's convenient , i go to steve 's . <sssss> good coffee , good workspace . <sssss> the end .
?		love that this is an independent ice cream and coffee place . <sssss> love the glass menu boards . <sssss> love the fact that a pink gorilla is an option at your party at the pink spot . <sssss> we ate our pizza from next door at z pizza in here at lunch . <sssss> it seemed a little more mellow . <sssss> wifi is available here . <sssss> there were a few suits with laptops sitting around , but it was the lunch hour , so not prime time for ice cream or coffee , so not crowded . <sssss> after lunch , i got a latte , and my girlfriend had huckleberry ice cream . <sssss> from across the room as we were eating our lunch , the server seemed the classic goth/emo kinda kid . <sssss> black hair in his face , tragic expressions , more black eyeliner than an alice cooper concert , etc. . <sssss> a little old lady ordered from him and was not pleased with his appearance and made no attempt to hide her disdain . <sssss> he put up with her civilly but it was evident that he was not that into this rude woman either . <sssss> when we stepped up to the counter , conversation with this kid was easy . <sssss> he was genuinely friendly , conversational and his service was a + . <sssss> do n't really know what that lady 's problem was , but you know the type . <sssss> he made a perfectly good latte , scooped up the ice cream and we chatted for a few minutes . <sssss> my girlfriend decided to buy a brown foam trucker hat with the pink spot logo on it and wore it out of the shop . <sssss> side note , at my place later that day , my 15 year old nephew stopped by and was so stoked by the hat that we gave it to him . <sssss> 15 year old boy , trucker hat that says `` pink spot '' ... you do the math . <sssss> great experience in customer service , quality coffee , good ice cream and local business . <sssss> go there
?		mojo teaches me portion control . <sssss> because the one time i did n't think about it , i paid nearly $ 10 for fro-yo . <sssss> if i had to think about buying food by the ounce , i would be skinny . <sssss> so just be mindful . <sssss> i do n't care for the vanillas , chocolates and strawberries . <sssss> they are plain , boring and kinda chalky . <sssss> i do like the mango and green tea , topped with fresh fruit , mochi pieces and maybe granola . <sssss> the cool thing about mojo is that they were pretty awesome with our company event . <sssss> they offered our entire agency , a flat rate for each cup so i took this opportunity to pile on the toppings . <sssss> i probably like the toppings more than the actually yogurt because it has nothing to do with the yogurt .
?		without having to drive all the way down to chandler , this is where i go to get my ingredients for all my vietnamese dishes . <sssss> you can get all your asian goodies here , load up on siracha , buy soy sauce by the gallon and all the chicken feet you want . <sssss> their produce is not always the best but they are very cheap . <sssss> i usually get the produce i ca n't find in normal grocery stores like bitter melon , chinese broccoli or bok choy . <sssss> my favorite is that they sell a whole bag of fresh garlic for less than $ 1 . <sssss> they are lacking in the fresh herbs though so i always have to go to another asian grocery store to get that . <sssss> their bakery always smells so yummy . <sssss> on the weekends they make chinese pancakes with either a sweet red bean paste of custard filling for only $ 0.50 each . <sssss> those are yummy . <sssss> . <sssss> also , if you shop later in the day , the baked goods are 50 % off after 4 pm . <sssss> another favorite about super l is the in-store diner . <sssss> they serve wonton noodle bowls and all sorts of rice dishes . <sssss> it 's tucked away in the corner by the roasted duck and chicken display . <sssss> great prices too , about $ 6 for a bowl of wonton noodles . <sssss> my favorites aisles = ramen noodles , tea and snacks . <sssss> i reminisce as i stroll down the snack aisle when i see all the cookies and sweets i used to eat as a kid but i usually pick up the wasabi peas or shrimp chips here . <sssss> yes ... shrimp chips ! <sssss> they are amazing , try them but also pic up a pack of gum too , you 'll need it .
?		the giant horse scared me ! <sssss> i thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance . <sssss> on a nice summer night , we were n't able to get a seat outside because there was a graduation party going on . <sssss> instead we sat inside and listened to the michael buble-ish croonster and his homeless sidekick . <sssss> i 'm not sure if he was homeless but he was rocking on the bass guitar and would add in his `` oh yeahs '' and `` uh huhs '' during an intense jam session . <sssss> it was creepy and cute . <sssss> my friend bought the table a round of marachino cherries that are laced with vodka and cinnamon rum . <sssss> it was interesting but way too strong for my tastes . <sssss> i started with an oak creek hefe which was warm so the server brought me frosty mug but that did n't help either . <sssss> i ordered the spicy cajun sausage appetizer and it was nothing more than a bowl of sliced sausage links floating in a cold hot sauce . <sssss> it was disgusting . <sssss> i had to ask the server if the appetizer was meant to be cold . <sssss> i 'm just not a fan of cold sausage . <sssss> the best part of my meal was the sourdough bread - and it was damn good because i was starving ! <sssss> oh yeah - the bathroom was pretty scary . <sssss> i liked the mops and brooms in there too , really made me feel like i was peeing inside a janitor 's closet . <sssss> oh wait -- maybe it was !
?		lots of old ass ed hardy/affliction-wearing dudes and leather-tanned cougars here ! <sssss> makes for great people watching when i 'm here on a saturday enjoying an awesome $ 3 margarita and eating some yummy vig tacos . <sssss> the live band was great ! <sssss> you do have to get there early -lrb- before 2 pm -rrb- if you want to get a seat out on the patio . <sssss> you can read the other reviews but the general consensus is that it 's a pretty cool place to hang out .
?		i am an amc moviewatcher ... and i have the card to prove it ! <sssss> i always catch the before-noon shows because they are only $ 5 - even for new releases . <sssss> the perfect treat for an early morning . <sssss> the theatre is clean and there is usually a line but i skip right to the self-serve kiosks and get my tickets right away . <sssss> also , sign up for the moviewatchers ' club . <sssss> you can earn points and get discounts on snacks , free popcorn , candy and even movie tickets . <sssss> i 've cashed in on a couple free movie nights already . <sssss> the concession stand moves slow . <sssss> i wish sometimes the kids at the counter would just move a bit faster to get our things , especially when there is a long line . <sssss> however , they are really good about upselling . <sssss> the butter factory is clean and works ! <sssss> the jalapenos for the nachos are fresh and packed in its separate containers which makes it easy and i do n't have to fish around a container of juice and soggy jalapenos for them . <sssss> the seats are comfortable and leave me with plenty of leg room , not that i need a lot of room but at least i know its there . <sssss> it is a bit chilly so bring a light sweater . <sssss> i have n't tried any restaurants nearby because it seems like there is n't any marketing for any . <sssss> most people come here just for the movies . <sssss> oh yeah and do n't forget to validate because if you did n't , the gate guards will make you go back to get it .
?		yum . <sssss> yum . <sssss> yum went there for lunch today and was a bit iffy because we were the only people there . <sssss> granted , it was 11:45 am and just before the lunch crowd . <sssss> we were pleasantly greeted by diana -lrb- i think that was her name -rrb- but she was super nice . <sssss> while we looked over the menu , we had delicious black bean fritters served with an avocado dip . <sssss> my friend had a cup for the pumpkin bisque and i got to have a taste . <sssss> best soup ever . <sssss> the ginger in the soup gave it a spicy kick . <sssss> while my friends ordered cuban pressed sandwiches , i tried the pechuga rellana : a chicken breast stuffed with mashed plaintains , black beans and rice and a caramelized plantain mash on the side . <sssss> it was love at first bite . <sssss> the rice was perfectly seasoned , the caramelized plantains were highly addictive . <sssss> i wish i saved room for dessert but i 'm coming back to have dessert and saving my fifth star for that ! <sssss> oh yeah - on monday nights , they serve up paella ! <sssss> i 'm in !
?		i love putting balls into holes . <sssss> there are just so many ways to do that here . <sssss> i like all the different obstacles and can be rather challenging at times . <sssss> i went on a saturday night and it was pretty crowded . <sssss> i had an older couple in front of us and they were moving along at a great pace but the group ahead of them were a bunch of obnoxious teens who just took so long ! <sssss> it was also pretty hard to find our balls because it was so dark and we had to keep running back to get replacement balls . <sssss> the different courses were fun though . <sssss> it one was different and presented a special challenge . <sssss> i think there were 10-12 different courses but if you 're awesome at mini golf , like me , it could go by really fast . <sssss> a fun place to slap some balls around but a lil ' creepy with lack of lighting .
?		i really love this place !! <sssss> nothinglike a fun sunday meal with my family to make me love it even more . <sssss> we stuffed ourselves with delish catfish , fried shrimp , and tasty hazelnut mahi . <sssss> service from rocky was really fast , effiecient without that fake cloying attitude . <sssss> felt like we were the center of the restaurant . <sssss> funny how things like fast drink refills , quick service and welltime plate removal can do that . <sssss> and here is the kicker of the evening . <sssss> . <sssss> i know have ordered or tasted every dessert on thier dessert tray , scary but true . <sssss> did you know that three of their desserts are made fresh there the rest including cheesecakes are made in texas and brought in . <sssss> i got the fresh brulee . <sssss> yummy . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back .
?		two hippies is a great little no brainer kind of placed to eat . <sssss> incredibly small and ran incredibly well , be prepared to squeeze your way in and out . <sssss> they have great specials and the price is definitely right . <sssss> for 5.00 you have lunch and maybe a bit of an experience as well . <sssss> today with kids in tow , the hubby and i had guacamole burger , fries , onion rings and a super yummo mushroom burger . <sssss> the mushroom burger was so good , love the mushrooms , cheese and the bun really worked . <sssss> i am so glad they put some thought into the bread . <sssss> the guacamole was not what i envisioned with thick guac , it had runny stuff that frightened me . <sssss> the kiddettes had sliders , so cute with their tiny little buns , the burgers not the kids . <sssss> we all adored the fries they just really work with the burgers , the seasoning is `` lawrey seasonish '' but what the hey it was good stuff . <sssss> pretty fast service for a line out the door on a saturday afternoon , it was already past one and people were hungry , big orders in and out and lots of people ! <sssss> they have service down you walk up order they write it on a lunch bag and wham it comes out in about 10 -15 minutes . <sssss> they do n't mess with a soda fountain so you have to be okay with drinks out of the can . <sssss> it kind of gives it a `` whacka-whacka '' old school feel ! <sssss> for those of you young yelpers , yes we did n't have an endless soda fountain back when i was a kid . <sssss> the parking really sucks , it is tough to get in and tough to get out i literally thought we were going to be in one of those chinese puzzles where you have to move the pieces every which way to work . <sssss> people are very serious about getting in there !
?		in order to arrange a upcoming uye `` butter party '' , jim , audrey , donald , amy b , heather and myself set up a little waffle exploration meeting . <sssss> for the good of the order we met up to partake in the phenomenon known as `` waffles and chicken '' . <sssss> to be fully prepared for the uye we ate to our hearts content . <sssss> i have to be honest and not lie , that i fully loved every scrumptious morsel . <sssss> from the yummy waffle , tasty chicken , to the yummy cornbread it was all good . <sssss> . <sssss> but the highlight of my eating was the macaroni and cheese ... creamy , sublime , rich , crusty in places , sharp cheese laced , man , i really like that stuff . <sssss> i did n't know if i should share the delicious treat with my family or squirrel it away in my purse to savor later . <sssss> kids loved it , waffles and fried food goes over big in our family . <sssss> the service was exceptionally good , courteous , well thought out , and made the place . <sssss> decor is a bit of whimsy with homey flair . <sssss> bright and airy , fresh and comfortable . <sssss> love the big old mason jars for drinks , nice down home touch , folks . <sssss> we met the manager who was very nice and willing to make all of our uye dreams come true . <sssss> she also informed us that they will be opening soon for the late night crowd from 5pm-3am . <sssss> simply ca n't wait to go back ... anybody busy tomorrow ?
?		sorry kids , i have to give this one a just okay . <sssss> nothinbg terrible about the taste but nothing mind blowing as well . <sssss> and a word to the wise the smashburger fries are dripped with a rosemary grease . <sssss> now rosemary grease i am sure has a place somewhere in fooddom ... but i am thinking it 's not on the plain fries . <sssss> ythe burger was okay , tasted like the kind dear mother used to make , fried on a skillet . <sssss> hmmm for 9 bucks . <sssss> . <sssss> not my thing . <sssss> oh and heads up . <sssss> . <sssss> one size on the togo cups ... and it 's not big .
?		monster gelato you are growing on me ... you are a -rrb- open and available b -rrb- great service c -rrb- nice selection of flavors that are made right there d -rrb- close to places i frequent thanks for being so patient and nice to my family last night with our millions of tastes ... you rocked it .
?		what can i say about cibo that has n't been said before ? <sssss> ... it has so many elements that make a great place to hang out and eat with friends ... * good service and courteous hosts * delicious fresh tasting food that scream i am somehow good for you * crepes that are to die for . <sssss> . <sssss> how can you resist ... * brick oven pizza * edgy decor dripping with hipness * great reflection of the downtown feel great for meeting after work , taking mom out to eat , wine and pizza with friends , downtown close to events go . <sssss> . <sssss> you will love it enuf said
?		my love of fez is growing each time i eat there . <sssss> maybe today seemed especially delish because we had been out riding bikes along the parade route , maybe it was the sweet potato fries that screamed this is as good as it gets for fries ... or maybe fez is just darn tooting good everyday . <sssss> well i can only speculate . <sssss> i still love their fez burger so much . <sssss> for me the blend of crispy onion ring/crouton / cheese , pear and secret bbq sauce along with the high quality meat just zings in my mouth . <sssss> love fez ... ca n't wait to go back .
?		ca n't wait to have a real reason to go back here . <sssss> we were doing a foodie market tour today and this was suggested as our last stop -lrb- my buddy tom had to take home fresh cannolis home to the womenfolk -rrb- . <sssss> my plan is to go back for delicious sub sandwiches since this place is close to work . <sssss> why have n't gotten lunch here already ? <sssss> they have great italian grocery supplies like the stella dora cookies i remember as a kid living in jersey . <sssss> i also perused the san marino tomatoes and pondered the differences from `` regular '' canned tomatoes . <sssss> at 7.00 bucks a can i guess i wo n't ever know . <sssss> i rather spend my money on baked goodies in the front case . <sssss> my husband , the wonderful michael surprised me with a eclair . <sssss> you know he loves me !
?		if i were to stop and get a donut here . <sssss> . <sssss> i am not saying i have , just if i did . <sssss> . <sssss> i have to say they remind me of the ones i love from so cal . <sssss> they would i am guessing , have that light greasiness combined with sweetness . <sssss> probably they are lightly iced . <sssss> i bet if i went there i would really like an old fashioned one . <sssss> just if i went there .
?		i am going to go ahead and say this is really wonderful . <sssss> . <sssss> okay i am usually quicker than this but just realized on my second visit that gelato 64 has guess what 64 flavors ... duh ... love the pepermint mocha very tasty . <sssss> . <sssss> the nieve adored her mocha and my youngest said peanut butter was very yummy . <sssss> they always run a neat and clean place and were open on labor day !
?		a friend of mine has been recommending this place for some time . <sssss> she is a big fan and is trying to slowly sample everything on the menu . <sssss> so today we decide to give it a try . <sssss> now i just wish it was a wee bit closer to our house . <sssss> you walk in off glendale ave. and it 's very comfortably decorated with a clean italian style . <sssss> it reminded me of pizza a metro with more room , and decor . <sssss> there is a large brick oven in the front that gives it an authentic flavor . <sssss> all the servers were very nice and treated us like we have been going there forever . <sssss> we ordered a cheese pizza for my daughter and a `` italian stallion '' pizza for us . <sssss> the crust was very nice chewy , with a light oven char that i really liked , a bit of tomato sauce , cheese and very different italian sausage . <sssss> very tasty . <sssss> my daughter loved her pizza , she was thrilled , i was afraid it would be too upscale for her . <sssss> but she was so enamored she about bit my husband hand off when he reached for a piece . <sssss> we are anxious to try some of the other items , they brought a basil and cheese pizza by our table that smelled heavenly . <sssss> we also saw some great pasta dishes at other tables .
?		hungry ? <sssss> want something to eat , like maybe fish ? <sssss> well this place has fish . <sssss> this is the kind of place to go when you want food but not really caring how good it could be . <sssss> service was great and very prompt . <sssss> the host , bartender , and wait staff seemed very into their jobs . <sssss> but the fish itself was not memorable . <sssss> a bit pricey , but offered many kinds of fish which seemed to be flown in ? <sssss> i would n't go back unless a group of people were meeting there and it was what everybody else wanted . <sssss> enough said .
?		what amy said .
?		i adore the funghi pizza and beet salad , ca n't wait to go back !! <sssss> tonight 's field trip to scottsdale was completed with dinner at the parlor and 100 % of my little group l-o-v-e-d it ...
?		wow where has this place been and why have i not seen their sign before ? <sssss> i know everyone has already reviewed and oohed and awwed , which it deserves . <sssss> but i am going to give it a better rating , it tasted great and my daughter liked it ! <sssss> yeah ! <sssss> my nine year old enjoyed it and it was good for her . <sssss> now we have a place to stop for a bite before getting on the freeway .
?		this place was fantastic . <sssss> the food , service , ambiance , and everything else were amazing . <sssss> we especially enjoyed some of the hand made pastas , but it was all very good .
?		great location , great food , and nice ambiance . <sssss> the menu is n't huge , but this is a nice french cafe type setting if that 's what you 're into .
?		i admittedly do n't know much about cambodia . <sssss> i know i want to see angkor wat at some point in my life , but that 's about as far as my knowledge extends . <sssss> when i saw there was a local cambodian restaurant here in phoenix , i was intrigued and wanted to stop by to broaden my knowledge base . <sssss> we walked into reathrey sekong on a friday evening at 6:30 pm and were sat immediately . <sssss> for a 4-1/2 star restaurant , that impressed me . <sssss> especially since we had just left another place after seeing a horde of people standing outside . <sssss> the inside is small but charming to say the least . <sssss> i ordered the cambodian iced coffee which was recommended in other reviews . <sssss> greatness . <sssss> i thought it was going to be too sweet , but it was n't , the mix of coffee and condensed milk was perfect . <sssss> i ordered the large serving of the cambodian bbq platter for dinner . <sssss> it was basically a big plate o ' meat that consisted of sliced beef , grilled beef skewers and grilled chicken wings . <sssss> it 's also served with a bowl of white rice . <sssss> excellent . <sssss> the two beef offerings were cooked so that they were still tender and the flavor was awesome . <sssss> the wings were on another level . <sssss> probably in the top 5 of best wings i 've ever eaten . <sssss> the only issue i experienced was in the order the items were served . <sssss> i waited for what i thought was a while before my coffee came out but it was okay . <sssss> i figured they were just waiting for it to brew . <sssss> my coffee came out , but my wife 's drink -lrb- coconut smoothie with boba -rrb- did n't come out for a few minutes later . <sssss> then the same thing happened with our food . <sssss> my food came out and hers did n't for about 3-5 minutes later . <sssss> it was n't a huge deal , but it 's just awkward when you 're sitting there with your food and your eating companion is sitting there watching you , twiddling their thumbs . <sssss> she was n't actually twiddling her thumbs . <sssss> does anyone do that anymore ? <sssss> anyway ... you get the point . <sssss> that was my only qualm . <sssss> other than that , this place was excellent . <sssss> if reathrey sekong is any indication of the deliciousness that awaits in cambodia ... i ca n't get there fast enough .
?		on the morning of nye 2013 , i went hiking with a couple of buddies in the mcdowell sonoran preserve . <sssss> as a reward for our outdoorsmanship , two of us went to grab coffee afterward . <sssss> i do n't know this area very well , but using the yelp app , i found that 's amore gelato by searching for `` coffee '' . <sssss> we had a hard time finding them at first and almost went somewhere else . <sssss> we stopped at something or other café and asked if they had espresso ... nope , so we left . <sssss> begrudgingly we continued our search for that 's amore . <sssss> aha ! <sssss> i found an address number . <sssss> we were in the right shopping center but on the wrong side . <sssss> that 's amore is located in the shopping center on the se corner of pinnacle peak rd and miller rd. . <sssss> it 's in the southern portion of the shopping center next to a thai restaurant . <sssss> i hope that helps you find them because this place is worth being found . <sssss> i usually order espresso , but when i 'm with this particular friend , he always orders his espresso with a dollop of foam on top so i generally will just have the same . <sssss> this particular day when he ordered at that 's amore , the lady said , `` okay , you want a macchiato '' . <sssss> that caught my ear but i did n't say anything . <sssss> i do n't think my buddy caught on at all . <sssss> he did n't care what she called it , as long as he got his espresso the way he wanted it . <sssss> when she presented us with the final product , it was perfect . <sssss> exactly what he orders every time . <sssss> i would say it was also a little prettier than usual . <sssss> the taste was very good as well . <sssss> that brings me to today . <sssss> i 've been thinking about how this lady corrected my friend and told him his drink was called a macchiato . <sssss> i 'm used to drinking a caramel macchiato from starbucks and they 're nothing like the drink i had on nye . <sssss> i googled `` macchiato '' and much to my amusement , the drink i 've always consider to be a `` macchiato '' , was completely wrong . <sssss> a macchiato is simply a double shot of espresso with a dollop of milk foam . <sssss> the word `` macchiato '' actually means `` marked '' , in italian . <sssss> the espresso is getting `` marked '' with a little bit of milk or milk foam . <sssss> the drink called , `` caramel macchiato '' at starbucks , is actually more of a latte since it 's mostly milk . <sssss> boom ! <sssss> i have been learned ! <sssss> i thought this was a great moment in my coffee knowledge history . <sssss> it 's the little things really , and i 'm excited to have been enlightened by the lady at that 's amore gelato . <sssss> oh yeah , that 's brings me to another point . <sssss> they have gelato . <sssss> weird , right ? <sssss> i did n't try it on this day , but look forward to it in the future . <sssss> 5 stars for increasing my brain power , and for becoming my new spot to grab coffee after hiking in the preserve . <sssss> if you 're interested in the article i read , here ya go . <sssss> it 's worth checking out for the funny or die video alone : http://alloveralbany.com/archive/2013/09/04/are-you-sure-you-want-a-macchiato
?		bootleggers gives a nod to the prohibition era with some cool cocktail and `` moonshine '' options . <sssss> i quote moonshine because unless i get my white lightning in an unlabeled mason jar from a shady guy in kentucky , i 'm reluctant to give just any liquor such a notorious distinction . <sssss> that term is being thrown around pretty loosely in recent years . <sssss> i tried one cocktail and it was good , but i have no recollection as to what it was called . <sssss> i looked for it on their online menu without any luck . <sssss> milady tried the blue moon drink which was a bit heavy on the basil for me . <sssss> we started with the bacon board . <sssss> an ensemble of delicious bacony meat delights . <sssss> it 's also served with some toasted bread pieces and a sweet onion jam that paired nicely with everything . <sssss> it also comes with a house made mustard that actually consists of mustard seed , not yellow sludge , it was good and interesting . <sssss> i 'd never had actual mustard seed before . <sssss> i got the pblt - pork belly lettuce & tomato with a side a mac and cheese for dinner . <sssss> it was good , but by the time i got half way through the sandwich i had to call it quits . <sssss> my stomach had begun revolting against the fatty pork products consumed on the bacon board , but it was worth it . <sssss> the mac and cheese was very good . <sssss> it 's served in the same cast iron skillet-thing in which it 's cooked . <sssss> i always like that look . <sssss> it had lots of creamy cheese flavor unlike more subtle m & c i 've tried recently . <sssss> on a non-food note , i really liked bl 's modern rustic décor . <sssss> older looking wood siding and exposed brick . <sssss> it had a slightly sophisticated yet natural feel and i 'm not usually into much in the way of sophistication . <sssss> there was a nice balance . <sssss> bootleggers was a good find . <sssss> i look forward to coming back to try more of their offerings after i recover from my current pork coma .
?		went back and tried the sweet potato fries ... which seem to be the same kind they use at delux only they are yummier there . <sssss> not feeling the cinnamon and they were kinda soggy . <sssss> clientele was very loud - dinner crowd . <sssss> made it hard to have a conversation without raising my voice higher than i think is appropriate for a dinner table . <sssss> music still not my cup of tea - unnecessarily spirited . <sssss> overall this place is not for me . <sssss> i do n't think i 'll return voluntarily .
?		ok . <sssss> so i love this store . <sssss> i never thought i would re-live the childhood joy and anticipation of going to the toy store until i found this place . <sssss> i 'm so glad phoenix finally got a designer vinyl toy store ! <sssss> its kind of our equivalent of kidrobot store only ... better . <sssss> i limit myself to one visit per week as this place has really sparked my vinyl toy obsession . <sssss> they have an excellent selection of not only toys , but books on related things and artists . <sssss> as far as the toys go though , there are tons of blind box series to pick from and plenty of bigger limited items . <sssss> there are even some big limited pieces and prints on display , gallery style . <sssss> toys range from $ 5 - $ 100 's so there is something for everyone 's price range . <sssss> they also have t-shirts , key chains , stickers , bags , stationary ... a little seating area for you to sit down and enjoy the atmosphere and brows a magazine and cold beverage . <sssss> there is always good tunes playing and the staff is fun , friendly , and very knowledgeable . <sssss> there is a mailing list sign up by the register or you can subscribe to their blogs on myspace to receive updates on weekly new stuff and sales . <sssss> a great place to take friends from out of town or the suburbs or to buy gifts for any urbanites in your life .
?		really more like a 3.5 . <sssss> good enough for another shot and worth inviting a a friend or two to come along . <sssss> saturday at 3pm : our waitress was friendly and attentive . <sssss> service was prompt . <sssss> atmosphere was laid back . <sssss> trio of dips was pretty tasty got ta say quite filling for two . <sssss> the chips were good . <sssss> they were halved -lrb- flower ? <sssss> -rrb- tortillas , deep fried in house i 'm pretty sure -lrb- they were still warm and shiny when they got to us -rrb- . <sssss> i had the house enchiladas plate vegetarian style . <sssss> tasty but greasy . <sssss> the rice and beans seemed over salted to me . <sssss> my boyfriend had the tacos plate via shrimp . <sssss> he was super impressed with the food -lrb- he 's not a mexican foodie like me though -rrb- . <sssss> the presentation was nice . <sssss> we had a couple happy hour drinks which were ok . <sssss> i thought the food overall was a bit greasy and salty . <sssss> granted , mexican style food are not really known for being healthy . <sssss> the only reason i ordered the dips and enchiladas was that this was the tail-end of our vacation and i was still ignoring the proper nutritional ratios meals should contain . <sssss> we 'll be back but i 'll be trying out some lighter fare as the menu had plenty of other choices i glossed this time .
?		the beer selection sucks and the little bit of food i have had here was unimpressive . <sssss> but ! <sssss> a good place to people watch ? <sssss> and be watched ? <sssss> if you 're into that .
?		went to fez on a friday for lunch with a friend and it was a perfect way to start off my weekend ! <sssss> i had the grilled chicken bruschetta sandwich -lrb- their august special -rrb- since we could n't decide on sweet potato fries or the garlic rosemary fries we ordered a basket with both : -- rrb - ... it was the perfect combo ... we got our food pretty quick during the lunch rush and service was awesome ... i will most def . <sssss> be back !
?		i 've been to hanny 's several times but only for drinks so i was recently able to actually eat a meal here ! <sssss> my girl and i left an event next door at the wyndham or renaissance i think it 's now called and since it was around 11pm on a sunday we wanted to find a decent place nearby that still served food . <sssss> so hanny 's was close and had people inside that were eating so we walked on in . <sssss> i love that this place was at one time a department store it gives it a modern and unique flair . <sssss> my friend and i were seated right away and since i had been drinking wine earlier in the night all i wanted was water and some delicious food ! <sssss> i was just going to settle on the onion straws but our server insisted on the roast beef sandwich , he said it 's what he was having later . <sssss> so on the menu the sandwich sounds pretty tasty , roast beef , bacon , arugula , and even a fried egg ! <sssss> so when it came out it looked yummy , it even came with a side of the onion straws that i was going to order so i decided to put them on the sammy to add some flavor . <sssss> i took a bite and ... i was kinda bummed ... i expected all of these flavors to explode in my mouth but that did n't happen . <sssss> . <sssss> it was just ok the roast beef was pretty bland but the bacon and onion straws seemed to help it out a bit . <sssss> my friend had one of their pizza 's and she said it was just ok as well . <sssss> the service was decent and the place has pretty good drinks so i may stop in again to give something off of their menu another try .
?		i 've been to the vig many times for drinks but this is the first time that i decided to eat an entire meal at this place . <sssss> i 've been hearing about their $ 5 burger and fries special on mondays so i made a dinner date with my girls and headed on over . <sssss> surprisingly we did n't have to wait for a table , even though their patio is the place to be it was a little too hot for all of that . <sssss> my girls and i decided to go for the burgers of course ! <sssss> i ordered the vigazz burger which came with arugula , gouda cheese , bacon , sauteed onions and some sort of sauce on a pretzel bun . <sssss> and since i 'm obsessed with sweet potato fries i decided go for those instead of regular fries . <sssss> i was n't prepared for this gigantic burger and fries that was placed in front of me ! <sssss> it all looked ahmazing ... and it tasted good too . <sssss> i could only eat half of the burger and fries but took the rest home to have for lunch the next day . <sssss> the service was so-so nothing bad but not spectacular ... our server seemed a bit uncomfortable or nervous ... maybe he 's new ?? <sssss> anyway very good deal for 5 bucks , i may have to make this my monday night spot since i live so close : - -rrb-
?		i met my girls here for lunch one friday and man was it packed ! <sssss> i have been in this strip mall a couple of times and never noticed this place . <sssss> one of my friends wanted came for the `` pho '' which everyone seems to be raving about . <sssss> i was not in a soup kinda mood so i decided to order the half of sandwich and salad lunch special . <sssss> the sandwich was just ok , it was grilled chicken on some sort of wheat roll , and some sauce that tasted a little off , the best part of the meal was the cilantro on the sandwich and my salad , whatever kind of dressing they used was delicious . <sssss> the service was extremely slow good thing we were not in a rush ; it appeared as though they were n't prepared for the rush of people that came in for lunch . <sssss> my friend loved her pho of course so i decided that the next time i eat here i will have to try this pho everyone keeps talking about .
?		so , although i live in scottsdale , just harley 's yummy cheesy garlic bread is totally worth the drive , not to mention all the other authentic , freshly made italian dishes !! <sssss> i am addicted , i admit it . <sssss> their bread is so fresh and delicious , i 've never had another italian bread like it . <sssss> its especially enjoyable with the house chardonnay , which is very reasonably priced . <sssss> then , when i feel like completely forgetting the concept of calorie control , i order the fettuccini alfredo . <sssss> this dish is made the way it was supposed to be , heavy cream and butter ; can you say yum ? <sssss> and i can add whatever i feel like to it . <sssss> for example , chicken and garlic . <sssss> harley 's has an intimate ambiance and is a perfect place for a romantic dinner for two , or even a large family gathering . <sssss> i highly recommend harley 's bistro .
?		this was my first time visiting tandoori times . <sssss> after seeing it advertised on groupon , i thought i 'd give it a try . <sssss> my friend and i decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday . <sssss> it was very busy , which was promising . <sssss> the waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu , but she was friendly . <sssss> the house salad was mediocre , the entree -lrb- algoo gobi -rrb- was delicious , but the desserts were awful . <sssss> the `` mango '' ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango , or any flavor of ice cream id ever tasted actually -lrb- kinda vanilla , kinda puke -rrb- . <sssss> yuck . <sssss> the rice pudding was not worth eating either . <sssss> the worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot , after leaving the groupon and cash tip , to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $ 40 worth of food ! <sssss> really ? <sssss> i told the waiter that we had spent just over $ 30 , and we obviously did n't expect any cash back from the $ 40 groupon . <sssss> he said his manager was `` fussy '' and would n't like it . <sssss> i basically told him that was too damn bad , and that i was n't ordering $ 10 more in food ; i was actually kinda saving them $ 10 ! <sssss> he finally figured out what i was saying and left us alone . <sssss> i did end up calling the manager though , who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter . <sssss> i do n't foresee returning there .
?		i really like this place ! <sssss> its small , but stylish . <sssss> service has been very good so far , and myself and my guests have enjoyed the food very much . <sssss> i adore the tuna steak sandwich , which is cooked to perfection -lrb- along with the fresh asparagus . <sssss> -rrb- both times i have ordered it . <sssss> i hope that quality control in the kitchen continues . <sssss> oh , and the key lime pie - amazing ! <sssss> seriously , worth having for lunch , by itself . <sssss> my only small suggestion is dropping the prices of the normal beverages . <sssss> paying $ 4 for an ice tea is a bit ridiculous .
?		dilemma was the name of the game at solo tonight . <sssss> i 'm conflicted because i feel like i had decent servers , but non-existent service ; and worst of all , there were good and bad components to every single dish . <sssss> i wanted to love this place , i really did . <sssss> it had been well reviewed , but perhaps my expectations were too high ? <sssss> -lsb- upon closer examination of the reviews , i saw that many were written by yelpers with just one or two reviews ; i totally see what they 're doing there . <sssss> . <sssss> and i do n't approve . <sssss> -rsb- other than that , i tried and tried to find an excuse , or a reason for the madness , to push the rating higher than three stars -lrb- which i find is extremely generous after my experience -rrb- , but - i - just - could n't . <sssss> so , the evening started off interestingly enough when i called to make a reservation . <sssss> apparently , there was some mass confusion on both of our ends , and i wo n't bore you with the details , but eventually everything worked out . <sssss> i arrived and expected a bustling restaurant , but it was barely half full . <sssss> considering that it was n't that busy , i was utterly shocked at the lack of attentiveness from the staff . <sssss> once again , very nice people - but shockingly absent service . <sssss> we were seated quickly , waters were filled , and we were promptly greeted . <sssss> i told the waiter i had a groupon and he said `` no problem ! '' <sssss> i placed an order for a three-cheese board and the pork belly with a farm egg to start . <sssss> that was the last time i saw him for a while . <sssss> -lrb- not because he disappeared , but because he was mostly tending to his two tables outside -rrb- . <sssss> when i finally flagged down the waiter , he acted like * i * had been the hold up , even though we had waited patiently , with menus stacked , for nearly 15 minutes before he finally came by and took our dinner orders . <sssss> i was a little miffed . <sssss> the three-cheese board arrived with grilled crusty bread , tomato jam , fuji apples , feta , pecorino romano , and a local bleu . <sssss> amazing . <sssss> the waiter tried to explain the tomato jam to my kid - i tried to explain that it was like fancy ketchup - he tried to explain that it was n't - and i tried to explain that she was five years old . <sssss> moving on . <sssss> the pork belly was flacid and not at all crispy . <sssss> however , the tomato jam + salsa verde + farm egg + grilled bread part of the app were amazing . <sssss> i was pretty disappointed about the pork belly and when my waiter asked how i liked it - he almost seemed dismissive as i explained that the actual pork belly was a major disappointment . <sssss> now , i know we all think we 're the gordon ramsays of yelp , but seriously - i 'm a girl who can eat and i clearly know how good food is supposed to taste , and something called `` crispy pork belly '' should , at all times , be crispy . <sssss> moving on . <sssss> i asked what he recommended for pasta ; he said the gnudi . <sssss> i asked him to describe it ; he did . <sssss> i asked him if it was `` mushy '' because i 'm a major consistency person ; he said they dip the gnudi in flour and crisp it up . <sssss> i said : sign me up . <sssss> my husband went with the coppa pizza , my kid went with the margherita pizza . <sssss> when my gnudi arrived , it was cold . <sssss> the braised beef was tender and delicious , but the entire dish was buried under a mountain of horseradish gremolata , and the gnudi was , indeed , mush . <sssss> i brushed off the gremolata , avoided the grainy , cold , mushy gnudi , and ate just the beef . <sssss> my husband did n't fare any better with the pizza . <sssss> first of all , it was tiny considering the price tag . <sssss> the tomato sauce had also been so over reduced that it was overwhelmingly salty and sour . <sssss> my kid spent the entire meal licking the sauce off of the pizza , which spoke volumes , because this is a child that would eat salt licks for dinner if we let her . <sssss> this was unfortunate , because the crust and the mozzarella were actually delicious . <sssss> in the end , we just could n't escape from that sauce . <sssss> the house offered to replace his pizza , but it had taken so long in the first place , we just did n't want to chance spending the night , especially since the restaurant had filled up in that time . <sssss> they removed just the one coppa pizza from the bill and brought us a complementary burrata appetizer . <sssss> like i said , super nice people , but waaaaaaay too many other flaws to overlook . <sssss> also , my water glass smelled like wet dog . <sssss> i have four witnesses . <sssss> including the waiter my husband grabbed to sniff the glass for a fourth opinion . <sssss> my husband totally thought i was crazy when i told him to smell it . <sssss> it was sad that that was pretty much the highlight of my meal . <sssss> oh , and no kids menu or discount or option of kid-sized portions . <sssss> in retrospect , the size of the pizza was kid-sized , so i do n't know why i 'm really even that upset .
?		stepping in to the parlor was a welcomed escape from the madness that is the camelback corridor . <sssss> i do n't know exactly what i expected but i was definitely taken by surprise , and in a most positive way ! <sssss> i loved the interior and the crowd seemed to be a potpourri of mostly young twenty-somethings : couples , young parents , and groups of friends . <sssss> we purposely asked to be seated near other kids or a loud party to drown out the tantrums that would inevitably possess my toddler following the antipasti course . <sssss> seeing how we only warranted dirty looks from one couple -lrb- and they looked boring and stupid anyhow so who really cares -rrb- i would say the seating arrangement wad ideal . <sssss> the restaurant was packed but there was n't really a wait and it never effected the quality of the service , and i have to say the food was pretty tasty ! <sssss> it seemed mildly pricey for the portions but the food was definitely good . <sssss> we had the cauliflower gratinata -lrb- needed salt and maybe some gruyere or other melty swiss , the cheddar was more like a beschamel -rrb- , the roasted beet salad -lrb- winning ! <sssss> -rrb- , a pepperoni pizza -lrb- a little too salty but still delish nonetheless ! <sssss> -rrb- , and a duck club , which my husband said tasted just like thanksgiving ! <sssss> overall , i like the ambiance , i like the service , i like the food , and i would totally come back !
?		i 've been going to fogo since the day they opened their doors and seriously , their standards are slipping . <sssss> the food is still phenomenal and the gouchos are still as delightful and polite as ever but something about the actual service staff that just stinks these days . <sssss> the first few months were amazing after the grand opening . <sssss> servers from brazil waiting on you hand and foot , never a cold side dish , crumb , or empty water glass on the table , and a swarm of gouchos descending upon the table with every flick of the `` button '' . <sssss> these days you 'd be hard pressed to find a server present with a decent iq - including the adorably bouncy young thing who compared the likeness of cuban food to `` chuy 's '' and `` cajun '' food on our last visit . <sssss> oy . <sssss> and i wish the menu came with a color coded chart for the service staff , who are often dressed in three distinct outfits . <sssss> i ca n't tell who is supposed to be our server , an expediter , or a busperson which makes it impossible to get refills , clean plates , more bread , or your check in a timely fashion anymore , which sucks because you never had to ask before - it all just magically happened and always with a warm smile . <sssss> the more crowded the place gets , the more ignored you become and the less the servers smile . <sssss> i remember the first few visits , they always asked if it was a special occasion and a manager brought a special dessert if it was and when i was leaving they always packed me a little box of the cheese bread -lrb- because i always go nuts for it over dinner -rrb- . <sssss> i went for my birthday two days ago and not only did they not ask about what the occasion was when booking the reservation or when seating us -lrb- as they had always done in the past -rrb- but when a waiter -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- overheard my husband wish me a `` happy birthday '' he turned and asked me `` it 's your birthday ? '' <sssss> and when i said `` yes '' and he said `` well happy birthday ! '' <sssss> and promptly brought me the check . <sssss> it was an awesome experience , not so much . <sssss> i 'd still go back but maybe not for dinner anymore and not at full price . <sssss> i used to think the extra money was worth the fawning they did over their clientele but no more fawning means it 's just another overpriced scottsdale steakhouse that charges per tiny 10oz soda bottle . <sssss> delicious cuisine but the service needs a massive overhaul . <sssss> toss the local scottsdale new hires and bring back the adorable brazilian waiters please . <sssss> and the tiny little red tabasco peppers , we miss those .
?		it 's okay . <sssss> the ramen noodles are the right blend of chewy and slurpee , but the broth and toppings leave much to be desired . <sssss> the char siu is bland and fatty , the garlic seems like it came out of a jar , the naruto is too thin and flavorless , and the broth tastes like hot soy sauce water . <sssss> seriously , hot water with lots of soy sauce . <sssss> the people who work here are nice enough but they always look like they 'd rather be shaving with rusty disposable razors . <sssss> the food came out way too slow and i felt the prices were too high for being what it is - peasant noodle soups . <sssss> with that said , they have boba milk tea -lrb- yay ! <sssss> -rrb- with chewy yum boba , and a great array of flavors . <sssss> the got mega bonus points just for having kimchee . <sssss> i 'll probably be back , mostly because california is too far to travel for one bowl of santouka . <sssss> it 's not terrible ; i 've just had better .
?		absolutely love love love their all-day happy hour every sunday ! <sssss> the bucatini and meatballs at $ 5 is an absolute steal - i highly recommend doing a double order and calling it dinner ! <sssss> the noodles are homemade and delectably thick and chewy , the red sauce is fresh , and the small meatballs are moist and delicious ! <sssss> we started tonight with the grilled artichoke , which was extremely tasty but highly overpriced at $ 12 for a single small/medium sized artichoke . <sssss> we also ordered the arancini , which was oozing with cheesy goodness and comes three to an order . <sssss> during happy hour , the arancini is $ 5 an order , which is totally reasonable for the size of the app ; regular price is about double . <sssss> i ordered the braised short rib and ricotta gnocchi , which was beautifully presented and nicely cooked , but it was bland and lacked seasoning . <sssss> the bombolini dessert was a lovely end to a great meal - four cinnamon sugar covered `` beignets '' on a bed of real vanilla mascarpone and meyer lemon curd . <sssss> the service was amazing and the food was great ! <sssss> the only downfalls were the intense number of flying insects invading our table space and the co-ed bathrooms . <sssss> i 'm all for social progress but there 's a good reason men and women have maintained separate bathrooms throughout history , and it has nothing to do with gender segregation . <sssss> it 's just that guys always pee all over the toilet seats ... overall , it was another great dining experience , brought to you courtesy of fox restaurant concepts , and we will definitely be taking advantage of this happy hour again in the near future !
?		i was here for the yelp event recently and loved it . <sssss> the facility was great and yelp did a good job putting together the event . <sssss> i noticed there was a lot to do there . <sssss> i am already planning to come back with my nephews so i can have fun walking around the mock grocery store . <sssss> i 'm also looking forward to racing my nephews through the car wash on tricycles . <sssss> bring energy when you come and prepare to have fun .
?		my wife and i went there last weekend for a birthday party . <sssss> it seemed clean but i do n't do well in smoke filled areas . <sssss> the ventilation system did not get the smoke out good enough for me . <sssss> the gaming tables seemed nice . <sssss> it 's also convenient to have a fat burger inside the casino . <sssss> we also went into the club which was ok . <sssss> i was very pleased that they were n't gouging for bottles of water . <sssss> this place is great if you 're a smoker .
?		i really really like indian food so this hard for me to write . <sssss> i was there today and the buffet was `` broken '' but the lady that sat us told us they had the food ready in the back . <sssss> the place was almost empty and i got the feeling she just wanted to get us to eat there at all cost . <sssss> she was able to bring us most of what we asked for and it was good . <sssss> it was when we asked for things that were normally on the buffet that she said were not ready and she could not or , should i say , would not come out . <sssss> we really started noticing everything after that . <sssss> there was a band aide wrapper on our table , my buddy got a glass with an old hard piece of rice stuck to the side and our overall experience was , well not pleasant . <sssss> the food they did bring out was good and i got to scratch the massive indian itch that i get all to often .
?		we went to hevean for brunch today , and it came with complimentary mimosas ! <sssss> the eggs benedict were , well , heavenly as was the smoked salmon . <sssss> yummmm .
?		after leaving zoe 's for lunch , we spotted easley 's and could n't resist . <sssss> we brought presents back to the office for everyone . <sssss> what did we find there for our co-workers ? <sssss> we brought back liz some bacon band-aids . <sssss> for lenee , a poop pen . <sssss> the other russ got a pickle launcher . <sssss> they also have a ton of stuff for halloween , probably thousands of costumes . <sssss> check it out .
?		woohoo ! <sssss> i finally got to try a pasty ! <sssss> i 've tried to go to the tempe spot a few times , but it was either almost closing , so kitchen was closed , or lunch , too busy . <sssss> but this weekend the 101 to our house was closed , so had to take a detour down dobson , passed cpc , and yelped -lrb- do i get a prize for working that in ? <sssss> -rrb- at my husband to turn the car around ! <sssss> i 've been trying to try this place for years , i pleaded . <sssss> boddingtons on tap makes me happy , the pasty i chose was the asiago chicken with roasted green chili , double happy . <sssss> hubby had lamb with a mint sauce , he ate the entire thing , amazing , then had a big fat nap when we got home . <sssss> the interior is diner-like they do have much more seating than the tempe spot -lrb- church pews with tables -rrb- and a patio at this location . <sssss> i would n't mind coming back for a patio-beer day . <sssss> oh and the waitress did mention they might start doing brunch on sundays soon , including mimosas and bloody marys .
?		i was out in qc visiting with some family yesterday and we stopped into the qcom . <sssss> one of my mother-in-laws has been raving about this place forever , so we decided to make a lunch date of it . <sssss> we started by checking out the cute little store . <sssss> they have a bunch of different olive oils to choose from , some of my favorites are the chili , lime and blood orange . <sssss> they also have tasters of their yummy tapenades , fresh baked bread , a decent wine selection and bath products made from their olive oil . <sssss> we then moved on to lunch , which is bistro style . <sssss> everything looked so good ! <sssss> i ended up getting the special lunch sandwich of the day , which was ham , cheese , marinated sweet red bell peppers , sauteed onions on fresh focaccia bread . <sssss> the bread is to die for , and everything else only enhanced the greatness of this sandwich ! <sssss> it might be the most delicious sandwich i 've ever had . <sssss> if it was n't so dang hot out , i would have loved to sit on their cute little patio . <sssss> after eating and then wandering a little longer inside , we were leaving and spotted a little garden . <sssss> we went over there , they had all kinds of flowers , shrubs and herbs for sale . <sssss> the woman working in the garden area was very helpful and knowledgeable . <sssss> i ended up buying a little basil plant -lrb- came in a cute little ceramic pot -rrb- for 5 bucks . <sssss> on our way out we stopped at the table where a guy was sampling their raspberry champagne and prosecco . <sssss> both were very good , i like bubbles : -rrb- they also have an almond champagne , which i am excited to try next time . <sssss> this would be a fun place to go on a saturday afternoon , get a bottle of wine and nosh !
?		we -lrb- me and husband -rrb- are pretty happy with the location of this new wine bar , since it 's within bike-riding distance from our house . <sssss> the decor is nice , cool patio with couches , full bar and a nice little menu . <sssss> we met some friends there last friday night thinking it would be semi-quiet since it just opened , but it was pretty busy , not complaining , i 'm happy places around here are busy . <sssss> the only thing is it was packed with cougars , cougars acting like 20-year-olds , so not really our thing . <sssss> but maybe it will calm down after it 's open a little longer , crossing our fingers , we really wanted to like this place .
?		last time i was at furio was for a chick dinner and it happened to be monday manicure night , which was pretty fun . <sssss> i 've been here a few times , once for a bachelorette party , once for happy hour and once for mm night . <sssss> all three times i had a good time and did n't walk out with an empty wallet -lrb- rare for old town -rrb- . <sssss> the interior is pretty cool and stylish , not too obnoxious and not a dive . <sssss> cute little patio . <sssss> the only pain is parking .
?		alright , alright , calm down . <sssss> this pizza is good , but why do i always walk out with a $ 70 tab for 2 people , for pizza . <sssss> come on ! <sssss> we did get the tiramisu , but the waitress could n't even confirm for us if they they made it in-house . <sssss> boooo .
?		so mexican-asian fusion sounds disgusting . <sssss> the first time i ever tried it , in fact , i hated it , yet a week later , i could n't stop craving it . <sssss> a fair warning was given by my friend , sean m. that i would n't be able to resist it . <sssss> teriyaki chicken quesadilla ... you should not work . <sssss> . <sssss> but somehow , you are one of the best tasting creations known to man . <sssss> chino bandido , you are so good ... you are so good that i am willing to eat there even though i know 45 minute to an hour later my stomach will be growling as loud as a mountain lion . <sssss> the service is speedy , i like that you write your order on an order sheet and hand it to the cashier where you immediately pay for your food and then you take your seat . <sssss> they come out a few minutes later calling your name so that you can receive your aluminum tray full of deliciousness . <sssss> i really dislike your snickerdoodles . <sssss> blech . <sssss> however , i can definitely see why guy fieri loves you so much , chino bandido .
?		i still like lux better . <sssss> cartel is very appealing , though , to those who know their coffee . <sssss> the menu is not huge , but it does offer basic , good drinks . <sssss> they have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks , if that 's what you 're into . <sssss> i like the atmosphere in there , and the bike wheel `` art '' is pretty interesting and unique . <sssss> this place is probably really great to study in , considering the fact that i see a sea of macbook apples every time i walk in here . <sssss> the employees are funny and nice . <sssss> anyway , it is definitely worth checking out .
?		maybe i am just a sucker for music venues in general , but rhythm room gets five stars from me . <sssss> buried in the heart of phoenix , it 's the perfect place for a band to draw a nice-sized crowd . <sssss> i 've been to rr several times to watching my friend 's bands play , as well as to see some other not so local bands . <sssss> now , rhythm room is quite small , which is why it makes a perfect venue for local bands . <sssss> especially when you 're there to support a friend play . <sssss> it 's an awesome place to just hang out with friends , enjoy a few brews and listen to some great music . <sssss> just like most venues catering to all-ages , they do separate the underage from the of age , which then makes it awkward to try and talk to any one who is n't in your age bracket . <sssss> the drinks are moderately priced , but they do have some pretty decent daily specials . <sssss> i think my only complaint about rr is the bathroom . <sssss> if you 've read any of my other reviews , i complain about bathrooms a lot . <sssss> but , alas , rr gets five stars because i have so many fond memories at this venue and i am a fan of the atmosphere .
?		i could eat at carly 's every single day of my life and still never get tired of it . <sssss> i am amazed at the wide array of drinks that they offer as well as the extensive food menu that offers vegetarian friendly items . <sssss> sandwiches , salads , soups ... it does n't seem like a complicated menu , however it is very unique . <sssss> some of the sandwich combinations are things i would have never thought of in a million years , yet they are extremely tasty and fully of flavor . <sssss> i am very partial to the turkey melt , but the boy i 'm crushing on is allergic to poultry , so when i go with him i will stick to the pear or the caprese . <sssss> the art is always changing in here ! <sssss> every time you step foot into this place it looks entirely different , because the art is from a new artist they are featuring . <sssss> you can buy the artists ' work , if you please . <sssss> i love looking at all of the works done by different artists around phoenix , it sort of gives me inspiration when i paint myself . <sssss> anyway , carly 's is in my top 5 places to go ... if you can top that turkey melt i will be thoroughly shocked .
?		we started with the mushroom appetizer - deep fried and dipping sauce is horseradish flavored - very delicious ! <sssss> i had the grilled salmon with sweet potato and broccoli - all perfectly prepared - my date had the talapia - for dessert we had the brownie and ice cream which was enough for at least 4 people ! <sssss> all this food for $ 19.99 m thru w . <sssss> our server was excellent also . <sssss> a fantastic deal and the food is excellent . <sssss> we will definitely return .
?		abuelos has been there for a long time but for some reason i have never been there . <sssss> so i decided to try it . <sssss> walking in , i was very impressed with the decor - looked like the cheesecake factory - or maybe a casino . <sssss> sat at the bar and started with a margarita . <sssss> it was ok . <sssss> tasted a little watered down . <sssss> i had 2 of them - which usually does the trick for me - these must have been really light on tequila because i did not feel the alcohol . <sssss> they brought chips and 3 salsas . <sssss> the salsas tasted out of the can - and chips were out of a bag - not much taste . <sssss> i had a combo with enchilada , tamale , taco , rice and beams . <sssss> the taco beef tasted like taco bell but it did have nice lettuce and tomato - the shell was crisp . <sssss> tamale tasted like out of a can although it was sitting on a husk . <sssss> avocado enchilada was smothered in a white cheese - the advocado was out of a can - smooth texture with no flavor . <sssss> the rice and beans were tasty . <sssss> i kept waiting for something to kick in after i finished my 2nd drink - it felt like i had 3/4 of a real drink since they were so watered down . <sssss> my bill was $ 31 . <sssss> - after tip i walked out spending $ 36 for a below average meal . <sssss> abuelos probably stays in business from sun lakes residents and people in from out of town that think this is the authentic southwest mexican food . <sssss> go down to rositas on dobson/guadalupe - not much on decor - but the food , chips/salsa , and drinks blow this place away . <sssss> mexican food should have some flavor - abuelo 's is overall very bland .
?		ok , so this is an update . <sssss> i keep wanting to give firebirds another chance , so we went there last night since i had a gift cert from xmas ... we arrive and it is approx 1 hour wait . <sssss> so we went into the standing area in the bar . <sssss> we stood by the fire which is really nice . <sssss> but for 30 min , not 1 waitress asked us for a drink order . <sssss> finally a couple chairs at the bar open up so we sit down . <sssss> the bar was dirty since people had just finished eating , and the tip was still sitting there . <sssss> i told my date , lets time it to see how long it takes for someone to wait on us . <sssss> it took 9 minutes for the bartender to come over to us and say , '' i will be right with you ... after he grabbed the tip and abrubty left '' . <sssss> then after that , it took him another 5 minutes to take our order . <sssss> we ordered 2 glasses of wine . <sssss> 5 oz glasses , a total of $ 14 plus tax . <sssss> i saw what he poured us . <sssss> i could have bought 2 bottles of the same wine on sale at frys for what i paid for 2 very small glasses . <sssss> he brought the 2 chards , and sat the glasses down - in the dirty mess , and left . <sssss> i had to wave him over to ask for the counter to be wiped free of obvious food crumbs . <sssss> i asked my date how much i should leave the guy for a tip - her reply was - he deserves not one dime . <sssss> 3 times in a row , we have been dissappointed with the bar service at firebirds . <sssss> after about an hour , we went in for dinner . <sssss> we both had salmon and it was very good . <sssss> loaded potato was great and vegis fresh , salmon cooked nicely . <sssss> but , i think i am done with the bar ... the manager really needs to know about this type of customer dis-satisfaction - not once , but 3 times in a row ...
?		this is the best gelato i have had . <sssss> small place , but quality is great . <sssss> i get a small size with pistachio on one side and pineapple on the other . <sssss> walk down to zia and check out the cd 's while you are eating the best gelato in town .
?		delicious salted caramel cupcake . <sssss> best sweet and savory dessert i have found .
?		i love lola ... the matador is simply craveable !
?		i always have a soup nazi moment here . <sssss> once i ordered a ` navajo taco ' and not an ` indian taco ' -- a mistake i will not make again . <sssss> they are hardcore , but pretty much some of the best food you 'll find in arizona . <sssss> every time i sit down to my indian taco , i think ... this should be the official food of arizona .
?		it was a well-priced happy hour for an upscale place , but i found the offerings to be quite limited . <sssss> burger was just okay , salt & pepper shrimp was accompanied by green bean fries , but they were all covered in the same soggy batter .
?		best breakfast in the valley - hands down !
?		so now i know what my favorite vendors are doing on saturday mornings ... nice to see tammie coe cakes -- wish they would have had their cookies ! <sssss> nonna 's and mama letizia 's will battle for my red sauce loyalties , but you must pick up some bloody mary mix from a generations-old recipe and some pickled asparagus from the cute guy of pickled perfection .
?		i would say they have earned my business for life , but it does n't feel like business when you 're treated like a friend . <sssss> the ambiance , charm and quirkiness of this place makes one feel right at home . <sssss> delicious deli items , an eclectic wine offering and top-notch service make this place my new favorite valley staple . <sssss> great for events ! <sssss> keep them in mind for your baby shower/bar mitzvah/engagement party etc. .
?		once again , the yelpers helped us when in unfamiliar territory . <sssss> we stayed a couple of nights at the 3 palms and ended up having breakfast here and satisfying a late night munchies craving . <sssss> as stated in other reviews , this place is very clean . <sssss> n ot to say other places are not , but you do n't feel like you are in a sleazy taco joint with questionable sanitary practices . <sssss> we both had a simple breakfast burrito for lunch . <sssss> while it was nothing to write home about , it was tasty and filling . <sssss> our late night snack was a big time pleaser ! <sssss> had a few tacos and and an order of the rolled tacos with guacamole . <sssss> perfect ! <sssss> would eat that same order for breakfast , lunch and dinner ! <sssss> if you are in that neck of the woods , drop in and order up some good mexican fast food !
?		were able to visit hula back in early summer before the face melting temps settled in ... and super glad we did . <sssss> the place was very busy and our hope of sitting on the patio was dashed immeadiately . <sssss> we did get a seat just inside one of the roll down garage door sections -lrb- which were open -rrb- . <sssss> there might have been some confusion with our waiter or maybe he was new . <sssss> seemed to lose track of us at times and the service was a bit slow . <sssss> it was busy , but it seemed a few of the staff was either young and new , or just young and somewhat clueless . <sssss> we really like good mai tais . <sssss> very few places make good ones and we never order them at a bar . <sssss> the hula 's mai tais were more than adequate ! <sssss> each of us enjoyed the two we drank and wanted to order a third ... except we might not have made it to our car . <sssss> poke is another fav of ours ... and hula satisfied that craving too ! <sssss> saw that they are having a summer special and you can bet we will be taking advantage of that ! <sssss> you wo n't find us on the patio though ...
?		finally made it to this hidden gem ... have to go back and check if anyone else had to search for it . <sssss> the fact that it is inside the courtyard of the complex threw us off for a couple of minutes . <sssss> liked that we had to hunt for it a bit ! <sssss> this is a place where once you start eating , you want to fast forward to the next day so you can try something else on the menu . <sssss> dined off the happy hour menu . <sssss> first , if you order a salad of the hh menu ... it is the big dinner salad , so be advised ... you will get filled up ! <sssss> jeannie and i each had different salads and they were both very good . <sssss> the downside was that we could not gorge ourselves on the other good stuff . <sssss> bbq pernil sliders & tilipia tacos ... too hard to call one the winner . <sssss> will require a rematch or two ... will be coming back until we get through the entire menu ! <sssss> ... at least a couple times . <sssss> happy hour means drinks and the bistro did not disappoint here either . <sssss> jeannie went with a well liked sangria and i tossed back two margaritas . <sssss> very picky about my margaritas and this was a good one . <sssss> they do use a bottled pre-mix , which i did n't recognize , but it was neither too sweet or sour ... the death knell of a good marg and a waste of a shot of tequila . <sssss> p.s. was in costco two days later and saw a gift card offer ... $ 49.99 for $ 100 in gift cards ! <sssss> they are good at all three locations . <sssss> guess you know what we are buying !
?		the mrs. and i were heading to scottsdale and we -lrb- i -rrb- needed a place to watch the spain vs. paraguay match . <sssss> azcentral mentioned this as a great place to watch the world cup ... and they were right ! <sssss> we could have watched synchronized swimming here and we still would have had fun . <sssss> we got there just as they were opening and picked a prime spot at the bar . <sssss> actually , we could have sat anywhere and had a prime spot . <sssss> kudos to whoever feng shuied the tvs in ! <sssss> this is the best set up i have even seen for a sports bar . <sssss> you feel like you are on top of any tv you want to watch . <sssss> there is even a place to dump your kids -lrb- i mean a place for your kids to play -rrb- ! <sssss> they have cool wii stations ready for a bunch of chicken finger - eating hooligans to enjoy . <sssss> being that it was brunch , we ordered a spicy bloody maria & bloody mary -lrb- the mrs. does n't do tequila -rrb- and started off with some chips & salsa with a side of guac . <sssss> the salsa was surprisingly good and so was the guac . <sssss> both way above typical sports bar fare . <sssss> the bartender was super cool , super cute , and a super drink maker ! <sssss> what more can you ask for ? <sssss> the bar was n't busy , but there were a handful of world cup fans that lent a fun atmosphere . <sssss> our bloodies came in these huge goblets and it took most of the half for us to finish them . <sssss> we scored with those suckers ! <sssss> half time gave us a chance to order . <sssss> we were not overly hungry due to the meal of a drink we had and of course all the chips . <sssss> ended up splitting a phoenix philly . <sssss> again , we were delighted with our order . <sssss> the sandwich was awesome ! <sssss> recommendation : get the side of cottage cheese with diced jalepenos . <sssss> i could have eaten a quart of that ! <sssss> rounded out the second half with a couple of beers . <sssss> they have pretty much anything you might want either on tap or in bottle . <sssss> our visit left us wishing we lived in arcadia ... within walking distance to this place .
?		this is just more than just a run of the mill fast food burger place ! <sssss> while the habit has other tasty offerings , you wo n't be disappointed in going with the burger mainstay . <sssss> if you are looking for something other than the bland , uninspiring , and `` never like the photo '' burgers at the big chains , duck in here ...
?		wow , this place rocks ! <sssss> i have been there twice , once for lunch and then again for early dinner . <sssss> they have a full menu for happy hour which runs most days from 11:30 -6:30 and an outstanding wine list , many of these wines are on special for $ 5 during the happy time . <sssss> the menu itself had so many choices it was hard to decide on what to order . <sssss> we ended up with rigatoni chicken that i had to come back for with a second visit , and we also ordered the manchego sandwich , recommended by our waiter . <sssss> they have a nice seating area at the bar , and also an outdoor patio . <sssss> they have only been open 3 months but this one is a winner with outstanding food and reasonable prices !!
?		just had an amazing dinner here tonight w good friends ! <sssss> this place is yummy !! <sssss> all dishes are prepared with less than 475 calories but you 'd never know it by the flavors . <sssss> they do n't use any oils in their preparation . <sssss> we enjoyed the house specialty of cedar planked salmon , kale ceasar salad , and our friends had arctic char w salads . <sssss> very nice inside , rich woods , patio seating as well . <sssss> extensive wine list with at least 40 wines by the glass . <sssss> piano music at the large bar area added to our enjoyment ! <sssss> our waiter , who was excellent asked if we wherever `` first timers '' and brought out desserts on the house for us . <sssss> the name `` seasons 52 '' represents that they change the menu every week . <sssss> . <sssss> this was an excellent choice for us tonight and we are looking forward to our next visit !
?		we stopped in for lunch recently and had a great experience ! <sssss> salads were fresh , hot bread served , and service was very good ! <sssss> another sam fox restaurant that did n't disappoint !
?		mucho gusto is like that girl who if she just put out a little more effort she would be the love of your life but she never does . <sssss> mucho gusto has so much potential but zero consistency . <sssss> now i have gone here probably five times and have had different experiences every time . <sssss> sometimes i get great food and great service then other times , like when i went for lunch today , i walk away disappointed . <sssss> overall the food here is decent . <sssss> i typically go with the trio chicken tacos with a side salad . <sssss> they are a good size that will fill you up without giving you that afternoon food coma . <sssss> the only negative is sometimes the salsa is too runny which makes the tortillas soggy and kind of gross . <sssss> the atmosphere is decent . <sssss> it does have a good patio when it 's not to hot to sit outside . <sssss> however sometimes they play the music so loud you feel like you 're at que club on mill . <sssss> if you looking for decent mexican food in tempe mucho gusto is your spot .
?		ok i love sandwiches . <sssss> i was the kid who had the same turkey sandwich everyday for lunch growing up by choice because i love sandwiches . <sssss> now with that being said i live near old town which is lacking a good sandwich spot in my opinion . <sssss> so when my girlfriend and i stumbled upon this place thanks to yelp ! <sssss> we were excited . <sssss> first of the place looks really cool . <sssss> it looks like sharp and somewhere you would want to eat . <sssss> it was a sunday afternoon and we walked in around 2pm , the place was relatively empty . <sssss> after we looked through the cold case and the menu we walked up to the counter and waited ... and waited ... and waited . <sssss> there were 5 employees standing right in front of us really enjoying themselves until one finally realized we had been waiting to order . <sssss> we ordered panini style turkey sandwiches paid and sat at the counter top bar . <sssss> the food also took a while to come out . <sssss> as we sat there we just watched the employees play on their phones , make fun of each other , hangout in the back and overall very unprofessional . <sssss> when our $ 9 sandwiches finally arrived they were only ok . <sssss> nothing we could n't have made at home with a $ 10 panini press from target some deli meat and bread . <sssss> it gets two stars because of the restaurant decor and ok food . <sssss> the staff kills this place they are loud , unkept and unprofessional . <sssss> i 'll spend a few more dollars and go to many of the other great restaurants in kierland .
?		went to lunch at los dos molinos today and was impressed once again . <sssss> i always like to ask the server what their favorite thing on the menu is and hate it when i get the most expensive response , today i did n't ! <sssss> i was recommended to the chicken enchilada plate . <sssss> i am normally not an enchilada type of guy , not enough substance for me and usually too much tortilla . <sssss> however these proved me wrong . <sssss> the enchiladas were piled high with moist shredded chicken and covered in green chile -lrb- not for the faint if heart -rrb- . <sssss> then it was all brought together by melted cheese which was crisped to perfection . <sssss> another great experience at los dos however if this is your first time there is a reason why each table gets its own pitcher of water !
?		a buddy and i went lemongrass for lunch today . <sssss> now i have to admit i have drove by this place for the past 2 years since my office is right down the street . <sssss> as i pulled up i figured this only has two options being great or making me feel like i need to take the afternoon off ... i do n't know why i was surprised , other yelpers have said the same thing and i agree . <sssss> this place is good . <sssss> this is one of the better hole in the wall places i have been to in a while . <sssss> i had the salad with lemongrass basil chicken as my entrée and was very pleased . <sssss> now i did go with the spicy level 2 out of 3 but this is n't a true thai scale in my mind . <sssss> next time i think i will go with the level 3 . <sssss> if you are looking for a fresh , filling and authentic thai meal for a reasonable price in tempe make your way over to lemongrass .
?		i almost went with `` meh '' ... i had a lazy morning so i decided to venture far , far away from my cenpho hangouts and try out this bfst place i 'd heard bunches about . <sssss> sigh , i thought it was around glendale and it was n't ... it 's way way north . <sssss> i could almost touch the pointe at tapatio , and was about to turn around when i saw it 's big bright sign . <sssss> okay , yay ! <sssss> breakfast . <sssss> i was hungry by then . <sssss> so i go in , and , sigh ... i have to stand and study the big plastic menu boards , very similar to pei wei 's ... mix and match , each item priced individually , pick an omelette and add some sides of your choice ... sigh , it 's a chain . <sssss> or if it 's not a chain they decided that looking like a chain was the way to go . <sssss> not for me . <sssss> interior is uber clean , give 'em that . <sssss> kinda too efficient , too slick . <sssss> midcentury modern styling with the toledo aluminum chairs , cool colors and styling - they got it goin ' on in that way . <sssss> but for breakfast , i just wan na sit down and order off a menu . <sssss> this is that `` fast casual '' style where you order at the counter and they 'll give you a number you clip to a stand at your table . <sssss> service was friendly . <sssss> the food was good . <sssss> i had a veggie omelette , rosemary potatoes and some pancakes . <sssss> oh they blew it with the syrup . <sssss> yes i 'm a syrup snob . <sssss> aunt jemima fans : do n't ever , ever try real maple syrup from vermont because you can never use that thick gloppy fake syrup again . <sssss> yes , scramble serves that thick , gloppy fake syrup stuff . <sssss> the pancakes were just a little less than `` okay '' - a little too rubbery , a little too thick , a little too dry , and got cold fast . <sssss> and that icky fake syrup does n't help . <sssss> anyway , this place is okay , but i would n't ever go back because it was a looooong drive for me . <sssss> i 'll stick with my faves : matt 's big breakfast , over easy , and i 'll keep mourning the loss of my beloved palatte . <sssss> sigh .
?		these are simply the best sandwiches and salads . <sssss> if you like your food -lrb- a -rrb- locally grown ; -lrb- b -rrb- freshly made ; -lrb- c -rrb- organic/all natural ; and -lrb- d -rrb- yummy - and who does n't ? <sssss> - this is the place for you . <sssss> now , admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and do n't know the drill , it can be confusing . <sssss> so pay attention : 1 . <sssss> look at menu . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> decide what you want . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> wait your turn to order . <sssss> 4 . <sssss> order -lrb- give your name -rrb- . <sssss> 5 . <sssss> wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed . <sssss> 6 . <sssss> pay her . <sssss> 7 . <sssss> wait until your food is ready . <sssss> 8 . <sssss> leave with your food . <sssss> note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside , or , -lrb- if it is 157 degrees out that day -rrb- , see if you can find a place to sit over at lux , they are very welcoming of pane bianco diners . <sssss> it 's all good .
?		the reason i love padre 's is it 's the perfect combo of casual , relaxed and delicious . <sssss> great prices , cold beer , great selection of margaritas and other drinkie-poos , and yummy food to go with the drinking . <sssss> i think the servers and bartenders here are all very nice , outgoing and friendly . <sssss> and they have a great sense of humor too - example : as a single person , i hate valentine 's day . <sssss> - every other restaurant in town trys to bring in the `` couples '' with all their hearts and flowers b.s. ... but padre 's had a hilarious party where they played only `` broken heart '' and `` he cheated on me and now i 'm going to kill him '' songs ... too funny . <sssss> love it there .
?		really happy i finally checked out urban beans last week . <sssss> friends have been yelping about it -lrb- off line , not here ; they 're not yelpers , that 's why i used a lower case y -rrb- . <sssss> anyway i really liked it ! <sssss> it 's a serene atmosphere , lovely art on the walls . <sssss> my iced mocha was perfectly prepared . <sssss> i was very tempted by all the pastries , and simply had to buy a fabulous cookie , but brought it back to the store to share with chris rather than add it to my waistline . <sssss> everything looked really yummy . <sssss> one star deducted for the proximity of the hairdressers who stand outside and smoke cigarettes . <sssss> when will these people kick that nasty habit , yuk ! <sssss> ruins the atmosphere for me .
?		this is the best pizza i have had in arizona hands down - it is even better than nyc pizza , in my opinion . <sssss> after trying multiple different pizzas i have come to the conclusion they are amazing and when you ca n't decide which of two you want from the menu , they have no problem letting you do half and half which is great . <sssss> they will even let you mix the sauce pizzas with the white pizzas . <sssss> however , it is n't just pizza that is outstanding here . <sssss> they have some of the best menu items i have tried anywhere , generally speaking . <sssss> one of the best being the most tasty cheese plate i 've ever had . <sssss> my suggestion is that if you have not yet been here that you stop whatever you are doing and head there now - your stomach will thank you .
?		i love the wine selection here ! <sssss> sometimes there are even wine tasting events that are great ! <sssss> the food is really solid too . <sssss> i have tried most of the menu and have never had a bad dish . <sssss> my all time favorite is the steak . <sssss> my only complaint is that the bruschetta is solid , but i hesitate to call it really good since this does n't really compare to postinos . <sssss> 5th & wine is a really good spot for a big group , party , etc. . <sssss> !
?		i ca n't say enough good things about postino . <sssss> as far as locations go , i think gilbert has the best food overall followed by postino arcadia and then postino central , but i would give all of them 5 stars except postino central which i gave 4 -lrb- due to freshness of ingredients -rrb- . <sssss> if this is your first time trying postino , you must try the bruschetta . <sssss> it is out of this world . <sssss> i 've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy postino 's bruschetta , but it is never as good . <sssss> aside from the bruschetta , the salads are wonderful , all of them , my favorite being the italian picnic . <sssss> most importantly , the wine is amazing at postino . <sssss> if you are not sure which to try , always try the postino exclusive . <sssss> it will never let you down . <sssss> all the locations except for gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also . <sssss> even better , on mondays and tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine and a tray of bruschetta ! <sssss> it can not be beat !!
?		the first few times we came here we were so impressed and we were really looking forward to our last visit here . <sssss> however , we were surprised with our extremely disappointing experience . <sssss> the first problem started when we ordered our drinks , one did n't come , the others took forever to get , and one of the drinks -lrb- the mule -rrb- was overly sweet and gross . <sssss> this was sad as we loved the drinks here prior to this visit . <sssss> the second problem we encountered were menu items we loved and came back for taken off the menu . <sssss> no more delicious scallop tacos and no more roast chicken . <sssss> instead , we decided to try some new things and order the crispy fish taco we loved before . <sssss> the fish taco came and it was fishy . <sssss> once again it took forever to get our food and some of it came out incorrectly . <sssss> of the things we tried we had the sidewalk dish which was just meh . <sssss> the final problem is one i am just assuming to be the case . <sssss> i think they may have taken the amazing chef that opened joyride and moved him to the phoenix location , but who knows . <sssss> not sure if we will be going back which is sad considering how much we loved this place when it first opened .
?		what is n't there to like about ocean club ? <sssss> i 'd like to start off by saying this review is for the bar only . <sssss> i 'd rate the restaurant a little lower at about 3.5 or 4 stars . <sssss> the bar is amazing . <sssss> there is good live piano music and the cocktails are so good - might even be my favorite place for drinks in scottsdale . <sssss> not only are the cocktails great , but the wine list is super extensive and you can not go wrong with almost any choice . <sssss> it frustrates me when people review restaurant on yelp based on the drinks , so i want to clarify that ocean club not only has 5 star drinks it has 5 star food . <sssss> the oysters are probably my favorite in all of arizona , they are cleaned very well and always fresh , and how can you go wrong when they are accompanied by pretzel bread and garlic toasts !? <sssss> the salads are also nice to have as well as the shrimp cocktail -lrb- they are more like little lobsters -rrb- . <sssss> the best thing on the menu thought ? <sssss> the mac and cheese !!! <sssss> you ca n't go wrong spending a saturday night with a drink and some light food at the bar at ocean club . <sssss> my only warning : it is an older crowd . <sssss> so if that is something that turns you off , it might not be for you .
?		i ca n't say enough good things about postino . <sssss> as far as locations go , i think gilbert has the best food overall followed by postino arcadia and then postino central , but i would give all of them 5 stars except postino central which i gave 4 -lrb- due to freshness of ingredients -rrb- . <sssss> if this is your first time trying postino , you must try the bruschetta . <sssss> it is out of this world . <sssss> i 've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy postino 's bruschetta , but it is never as good . <sssss> aside from the bruschetta , the salads are wonderful , all of them , my favorite being the italian picnic . <sssss> most importantly , the wine is amazing at postino . <sssss> if you are not sure which to try , always try the postino exclusive . <sssss> it will never let you down . <sssss> all the locations except for gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also . <sssss> even better , on mondays and tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine and a tray of bruschetta ! <sssss> it can not be beat !!
?		we really enjoyed our meals here . <sssss> almost everything was great . <sssss> the place is super cute inside and is much bigger than it appears when you walk in . <sssss> we started with the mussels appetizer which blew me away . <sssss> this is the first place that i have been to in arizona that can actually make decent mussels and these were n't just decent - they were awesome ! <sssss> for the entrees we tried the lamb and the scallops . <sssss> both were great . <sssss> the only comment i can make is that the lamb was out of this world , but the scallops were just `` solid . '' <sssss> also , the cream of mushroom soup was pretty bland so that is the only thing i would recommend skipping . <sssss> this is truly a great neighborhood place and i ca n't believe i waited so long to try it . <sssss> i will be back soon !
?		i went to this restaurant for an early dinner with my boss and coworker a couple of weeks ago . <sssss> we arrived around 4pm and the place was empty which was n't surprising given the time of day . <sssss> my first impression was that the place is chic and upscale or typical scottsdale and i do n't mean that as an insult . <sssss> we started out with the bruschetta caprese appetizer and drinks . <sssss> i 'm not a fan of caprese items so i wo n't comment on the appetizer other than to say the boss and co-worker liked it . <sssss> when i asked for a beer list , i was told they did n't have one . <sssss> so i asked for a rundown of what was on tap and in bottle . <sssss> our waiter 's accent was so thick that i could n't understand a single name besides fat tire -lrb- by new belgium -rrb- in a bottle . <sssss> i ordered that because after all , i could n't understand any of the other options so i went with what i knew . <sssss> i found it disappointing that an upscale establishment like this would n't have something less generic that fat tire to offer to beer drinkers . <sssss> tommy v 's is n't that far from three local breweries -lrb- papago , four peaks , and san tan -rrb- so why go with something as bland -lrb- my opinion -rrb- as fat tire as your only craft beer ? <sssss> i think someone needs to introduce tommy v 's managers to the idea of `` drink local '' . <sssss> for dinner , i ordered the recommended grilled cheese and short rib sandwich -lrb- arugula , pickled caramelized onion , manchego & cheddar cheese -rrb- with fries . <sssss> the meat in the sandwich was tasty as was the cheese , but the bread was a soggy mess with grease . <sssss> i would n't order it again , but if you do n't mind the mess and like short ribs , you 'll probably like this meal . <sssss> for dessert , we got the cannolis . <sssss> i do n't have a lot of experience with cannolis -lrb- i prefer other italian treats like tiramisu -rrb- , but my coworker said they were too sweet . <sssss> i thought the pastry part was delicious - nice and crisp and the filling was very sweet , but eaten slowly , it was a nice combination . <sssss> there are a couple of things on their menu that i want to try someday , but was n't hungry enough to order at this visit so i 'll be going back .
?		the beer is cold , but nothing memorable . <sssss> i had the vanilla porter -lrb- like a lackluster version of other well-known , better executed vanilla porters -rrb- . <sssss> it was cold and hit the spot , but that is about it . <sssss> my husband had the trooper ipa and it was just `` ok '' . <sssss> we both tried samples of other beers - me , the cream ale upon the waitress 's recommendation and the husband , the rye ipa . <sssss> the cream ale was not good ... reminded me of a budweiser with a creamy head and mouth-feel . <sssss> the rye ipa was too sweet and gross according to my husband . <sssss> for dinner , my husband had the green chile pork and he was decently impressed with it . <sssss> the tortillas that came with it were very tasty and the pork had just the right amount of spice . <sssss> i had the sunup salad which was pretty good minus a few bad pieces of spring mix greens . <sssss> the prickly pear vinaigrette did n't taste like prickly pear to me , but rather like a bland , slightly sweet vinaigrette . <sssss> still good , but could have hit it out of the park if it had actually tasted like prickly pear . <sssss> service was good ... waitress was very friendly and attentive , but not to the point of being annoying . <sssss> i am glad we live on the east side of town where there are better breweries ! <sssss> i do n't think i could handle only having sunup as a brewery .
?		the good : the beer selection is excellent ! <sssss> personally , i enjoy elsie 's irish cream milk stout and the orange blossom . <sssss> they have a good selection of craft breweries from out of state too . <sssss> the bad : the customer service is seriously bad . <sssss> we have gone to papago countless times and have yet to ever have good service . <sssss> we 've even tried sitting at the bar to see if that will help ... nope . <sssss> it takes talent to ignore people who are right in front of you . <sssss> the beer outweighs the bad service which is why they get 4 stars and we continue to go to papago .
?		this ty loves the thai steak and noodle salad . <sssss> holy shizzz !!! <sssss> lunchtime was beyond busy but we arrived just before the rush . <sssss> our waitress bryn was fantastic and she made the experience that much better . <sssss> houstons where have you been my entire life ?
?		i love there food , atmosphere , and there hip staff , which you could see working at trails . <sssss> the portion size is eminence and the service is pretty good . <sssss> i have noticed a couple more locations in phoenix and glendale , will definitely be trying them out .
?		i recently visited the clarendon kitchen for the first time . <sssss> we went on a sunday after church with about 6 people , myself included . <sssss> the decor was great , kinda va-to meets chic . <sssss> and the urinals made out lips were stunning !!! <sssss> that was the good ... ... here 's the bad ... ... we were the only people in the restaurant and were seated immediately . <sssss> so i had thought that quick service with our drinks and food would follow in the same foot steps.boy was i wrong . <sssss> the table only ordered 2 drinks for the bar , one bloody mary and one mimosa . <sssss> and with $ 8 dollar price tags each you can see why ... ouch . <sssss> after about 5 min the waitress brought out every ones coffee and water . <sssss> about 5 min after that she brought the drinks from the bar . <sssss> remember the place is empty . <sssss> i ordered the chimichanga , and my bf ordered the patty melt . <sssss> after about 30 min the chef came out and asked how everything was . <sssss> we said `` good except we do have our food yet '' he said i will go and check on it ... ... wait ... . <sssss> did n't he say he was the chef ? <sssss> maybe they have to when its so busy like this ... ... . <sssss> finally when the food arrived , our waitress could n't remember who got what . <sssss> my chimi was enormous in size but pretty mediocre in taste . <sssss> my bf 's patty melt which he asked for rare come out well done ... oops , close i guess we stated up front that everyone was on separate checks except my bf and i . <sssss> when the checks came we had our own check but everyone else 's was together . <sssss> when we told her she said it 's alright i can ring them all , i remember what each of you got ... . <sssss> . <sssss> uh not likely , you could n't even remember when you were bringing the food . <sssss> so after about 2 min she came back and said i will just print out new separate bills . <sssss> `` ya think ? '' <sssss> when she came back with those bills she had added the tip in , so now our bill was 8 dollars higher then when bill came out before . <sssss> cool whatever , at this point we are ready to run for the hills , it had been one dumb thing after another . <sssss> when she brought out my friend danny 's change , she told him that they did n't have 19 cents so she just gave him a quarter . <sssss> what ? <sssss> and after he looked at his bill he saw that he was actually owed 50 cents not 19 . <sssss> can this girl not count or something ? <sssss> what else can she not do ? <sssss> 1 . <sssss> remember what everyone got 2 . <sssss> keep drinks filled 3 . <sssss> listen . <sssss> so all in all i might go back but maybe only for a dip in the fabulous pool . <sssss> one other note , they should get music that compliments the atmosphere , decor and the food ... .
?		if you have work to get done and need lots of room , free wifi , great food and coffee - this is definitely your place !
?		great atmosphere for just hanging out to read a book or even get some work done . <sssss> staff is always friendly and the coffee fresh . <sssss> yes , they even have free wifi
?		jeff , the owner , took what was a great coffee shop and turned it into an awesome destination experience . <sssss> the place is always filled -lrb- which makes for some great people watching -rrb- and it is a treat just to kick back and relax . <sssss> if you love coffee shops , this is a must !
?		still a fan ! <sssss> this time around i tried the chicken hummus platter . <sssss> de-lish ! <sssss> i phoned in the order with no problems . <sssss> the chicken had a nice seasoning to it and their hummus is simply wonderful ! <sssss> i do n't know why i did n't try this place out sooner . <sssss> the word is that this place `` tastes healthy '' but i think it is perfect ! <sssss> for being a `` healthy '' eatery it sure does have mas flavor !!!
?		this review is for the wireless booth in the store . <sssss> heard purchasing a phone here vs. through my service provider is cheaper and you get some extras like a case and a car charger . <sssss> this is true , i believe i saved around $ 50 on the phone . <sssss> the complimentary case was cheap and i threw it in the trash . <sssss> the car charger will definitely be useful . <sssss> the guys working the booth are very nice , helpful , and patient . <sssss> i witnessed them dealing with several non savvy wireless customers . <sssss> why i wo n't buy here again ... the supervisor running.the booth transferred my contacts over only after i asked him to do so . <sssss> then he transferred them over in some round about way so i had to accept all of my contacts 1 by 1 , going through a menu page each time . <sssss> after a couple of days i noticed some of my contacts did n't make it through the transfer . <sssss> so to the verizon store i go.to get the job done right . <sssss> plus at the verizon store they go above and beyond explaining the basics of your phone before you leave . <sssss> i also had to wait a few days to get my phone . <sssss> it was more than the 2 day delivery that they advertise . <sssss> however this did n't bother me especially since i just saved some dough . <sssss> the fact that i had to go back to the store to activate my phone did n't bother me either . <sssss> the unefficient transferring of my contacts and no regard to explain anything about my phone did bother me . <sssss> lesson learned , pay the extra money and get everything done the same day , and go home happy and complete .
?		5 stars for the kolaches and the customer service ! <sssss> sam the co-owner chatted it up with my boyfriend and i while we ate our kolaches at the counter . <sssss> my boyfriend is from texas and knows his kolaches . <sssss> we 've noticed the sign on the sidewalk and finally made it in . <sssss> they claim it is the only place dishing out the texas kolaches -lrb- i 'll stand by that claim -- we 've been looking for kolaches for awhile now -rrb- . <sssss> they serve up spicy sausage , regular , and spicy ham & jalapeno - all served with cheese , yes please . <sssss> if you have never had a kolache it is similar to a pig-in-a-blanket amped up on yumminess . <sssss> they have an espresso machine and many donuts choices . <sssss> i will be saving that experience for next time . <sssss> oh , and i also read someone 's review on breakfast burritos - looking forward to that too . <sssss> it 's an older place that reflects its age . <sssss> with a little sprucing up it could the cutest and best donut/kolache shop in town !
?		we used to do our weekly sunday breakfast at chompies . <sssss> . <sssss> that was until i got serious food poisoning from them and vowed never to go back . <sssss> this left me and my family in quite the pickle ... we love local breakfast places but hate chain restaurants . <sssss> one morning while driving around to find a new breakfast spot we found mark 's ... tucked away in a little corner of a strip mall . <sssss> as soon as we walked in i could tell it was going to be good , the customers were so happy , and the employees were super nice . <sssss> the food is simply amazing , chef mark is a wiz in that kitchen . <sssss> everything i have ordered from here i would eat over and over again . <sssss> my favorite is the hollandaise , it is the best i have ever had !! <sssss> i recommend this place for anyone looking to break out of the restaurant rut .
?		this place really has everything ! <sssss> i love browsing through all of the isles at all the different foods and buying new things . <sssss> i also love to buy my sushi making supplies here . <sssss> why woudl i spend $ 10 for a bag of sushi rice when i can get is for $ 3 at lee lee ; s ? <sssss> the only reason i did not give 5 stars is their lack of sushi grade fish , and the putrid fish smell -lrb- a sign of not so fresh fish -rrb- . <sssss> but if you can push past the smell this is well worth the stop !
?		our family loves oreganos ! <sssss> their salads are sooo good and the pizza is to die for ! <sssss> my 2 favorite go to 's are : alfredo the dark pasta with chicken - creamy and spicy alfredo sauce with big curly noodles , and a nice fire roasted chili on top . <sssss> thin crust cheese pizza - add some freshly grated parm and the red chili oil from the condiment tray on the table ... so simple , but damn is it amazing ! <sssss> but the most amazing thing on this planet is the pizzookie . <sssss> . <sssss> when you get that first bite of warm gooey cookies , and cold creamy ice cream , you will think you died and gone to heaven . <sssss> and it 's free on your birthday !!! <sssss> the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because it is hit or miss with the services . <sssss> 1/2 the time the waiter/waitress is amazing and totally on their game . <sssss> the other 1/2 of the time we would wait 30 minute for our check , 20 minutes for refills , ask repeatedly for condiments or utesils . <sssss> but being right across the street from asu i bet the turn around there is crazy . <sssss> and the parking lot it tiny , there have been a few times we circled and circled for 10 minutes and never found a spot and were forced to eat somewhere else . <sssss> all in all , amazing food at decent prices : -rrb- highly recommend for families or friendly get togethers .
?		i have been here for valentine 's day dinner as well as happy hour after work . <sssss> i much prefer hh after work . <sssss> it 's very laid back and quaint which is nice for hh and glasses of wine under $ 10 are 50 % during happy hour . <sssss> we had two different bruchetta `` flavors '' and a cheese board . <sssss> both were awesome ... the pecan butter bruchetta is very rich ... good , but rich . <sssss> ; -rrb- the bartenders were very knowledgeable on all of their wines and awesome to shoot the shii with . <sssss> i will absolutely be back to post up at the bar again after work , great way to end the day . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		this bar is unlike any other that i 've been to on mill . <sssss> most bars on mill either smell or make you feel too old if you 're out of college . <sssss> this is a great laid back feel with a nice atmosphere to just hang and have a bite with a beer . <sssss> they have a lot of good munchies on the menu along with a huge beer selection . <sssss> my favorite as far as food goes ? <sssss> the pretzels with cheese ! <sssss> mmmmm ! <sssss> the beer menu is large , but not so large you feel overwhelmed like world of beer down the street . <sssss> they have a nice patio that i enjoyed drinking on many times in the spring . <sssss> : -rrb- but the inside is n't bad either , the bar area is pretty big and the tables in the back are cool if you 're with a group . <sssss> parking is to be desired . <sssss> i mean , it 's on mill so you ca n't really have high expectations as far as parking goes . <sssss> for that i do not fault them . <sssss> : -rrb- if you are near by and have n't tried this place i highly recommend it , especially if you are n't much on the mill scene .
?		who does n't love four peaks ? <sssss> this is a great place that 's good for happy hour drinks and appetizers or just dinner . <sssss> the food is delicious every time and the beer is always cold and yummy ! <sssss> the parking can sometimes be a pain with the tiny gravel lot in the back so it tends to be easier if you just park on the street . <sssss> in my giant suv i find it 's easier to park on the street , personally . <sssss> their spinach dip is to die for ... literally ... i 'd die . <sssss> the patio is decent , not phenomenal ... the inside though is really laid back , cool , industrial feel to it . <sssss> service is always great whether at the bar or table . <sssss> i think at this point everyone in the phoenix are have been here ... if you have n't - now ya know !
?		man , i love this place . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> the decor is awesome . <sssss> the huge wingback chairs . <sssss> bench seats . <sssss> leather couches . <sssss> chandeliers . <sssss> the wallpaper . <sssss> the nook where the band plays up front . <sssss> the bar . <sssss> heck , even the people are pretty . <sssss> ; -rrb- i love their pretzel bites and the meat and cheese boards . <sssss> all delicious . <sssss> i had a bite of the meatloaf and i got ta tell ya , did n't love it . <sssss> i 'm honestly not a huge meatloaf fan so i 'm not a great judge , but i did n't even feel that the green beans were very delicious . <sssss> -lrb- that 's okay by me though , i would never order the meatloaf . <sssss> -rrb- i had the red blend of the wine and it was really yummy , my friends all did mixed drinks or beer - all were satisfied . <sssss> there has only two things i was dissatisfied with in the two times i 've been . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> -rrb- convenience of parking ... -lrb- just valet -rrb- . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> -rrb- the service on my second visit was terrible . <sssss> there were 6-7 of us all having cocktails , but not loud by any means . <sssss> our waiter wanted nothing to do with us . <sssss> he failed to explain that the meet and cheese that my two friends ordered would be on one plate . <sssss> typically that would be self explanatory , unless two people order it separately not sitting next to one another . <sssss> that was awkward when one person ate the food for two people . <sssss> when asking for the other individuals food the waiter rolled his eyes and quickly explained they were both obviously served on one board . <sssss> could have been good information to know ahead of time . <sssss> my only point from my rant is , if you do n't want to deal with groups in social settings serving may not be the occupation for you . <sssss> as a friendly group of people we 're never a pain to serve and are always happy to tip ! <sssss> : -rrb- i have no doubt i will be back to culinary , maybe i 'll give the one in phoenix a try - it looks like it has a pretty cool vibe to it . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		went in here on a random weeknight to meet with a couple friends . <sssss> it is not at all what i expected . <sssss> if you 're looking for a good dive bar in the valley ... this is it . <sssss> i do n't mean dive bar like patty 's that right in the hustle and bustle of things . <sssss> i mean , you 're going to more than likely pass the place on your way , have to turn around and then park you car behind this small building after feeling like you went offroading through potholes . <sssss> the inside is bigger than what i expected . <sssss> they have a decent sized bar , old tv 's placed around on the walls , a few booth throughout , pool table and a patio out back . <sssss> when i initially walked in it was eerily quiet . <sssss> i quickly figured out this was because everyone was watching one of my favorite horror movies ... the devils rejects . <sssss> nice !!! <sssss> the bartender was nice , attentive and our drinks were yummy . <sssss> i 'll be honest most of the time in dives the bartenders friends are all hanging out so they 're not always as on point as they could be . <sssss> this chick however , was great . <sssss> after a while my neck hurt starring at the tv so i moved on to the megatouch game ! <sssss> this is actually one of the last bars that have the photo hunt i like so i was super excited ! <sssss> we sat there and played that for a few games and headed out . <sssss> overall , i liked this place . <sssss> it was a good place to come and hang . <sssss> just picture something like out of the midwest with `` regulars '' and the walls packed with random pictures/postersj/you name it . <sssss> also , just to clarify - the people in this joint were n't old people who find a neighborhood bar and just spend their life there . <sssss> people here were from their 20 's to 40 's . <sssss> not a bad mix . <sssss> not a bad bar .
?		surf and turf burger is terrific . <sssss> crab boils are always a favortie in my book . <sssss> staff always friendly and well trained .
?		every lost candy i thought i would never find again sitting in bins or bagged up ready for purchase .
?		best doughnuts in chandler . <sssss> fresh doughnuts made throughout the day . <sssss> every drink under the sun besides coffee .
?		good nachos , breakfast burritos , and regular tacos .
?		awesome burgers ! <sssss> one of my favorite burger places . <sssss> pretty simple menu . <sssss> what size burger do you want 2/3 all the way up to 1 pound and how do you want it cooked . <sssss> they have a few favorite selections that come with certain things on them but you can order it however you want then hit the topping bar and load it up . <sssss> have n't been brave enough to try the game meat burgers yet . <sssss> one of these days though . <sssss> fries and onion rings are great . <sssss> they have two coke freestyle machines which are always great . <sssss> like to be able to mix my soda up . <sssss> now these are $ 6 , $ 7 , $ 8 burgers so this is n't your cheap drive thru burger but it is so worth the price . <sssss> may not be an everyday place but once in awhile it is a great treat . <sssss> for me it is close to work and great for lunch because you pay when you order then once you finish your food you can just leave or you can always get it to go . <sssss> people are nice and the burgers are awesome . <sssss> i will keep coming back .
?		where has this place been hiding . <sssss> took my wonderfully beautiful girlfriend here on a surprise date after we saw a movies . <sssss> this is one of her favorite restaurants and i wanted to try it out . <sssss> plus take her out for a nice dinner . <sssss> everything was very nice . <sssss> very unassuming little place in a nondescript strip mall . <sssss> everyone inside was very friendly . <sssss> the food was amazing . <sssss> some of the best americanized italian food i have ever had . <sssss> of course if you want authentic italian food you have to go to italy or make it yourself . <sssss> i got the risotto and my girlfriend got the gnocchi . <sssss> we shared . <sssss> trying bites of each others dishes . <sssss> i could n't decide which one i like more . <sssss> they were both so good . <sssss> the gnocchi was very tender and fresh but the risotto was no slouch either . <sssss> it was a great meal . <sssss> even the bread they brought out was very good . <sssss> the price was very reasonable too . <sssss> not as expensive as i was thinking it was going to be . <sssss> we will definitely be back . <sssss> i really want to try a pasta dish because i am told they use fresh homemade pasta . <sssss> i think if i did n't like this place my girlfriend would have dumped me on the spot .
?		i have never been to a charleston 's before . <sssss> i have seen the commercials on tv but never connected that this was the place i was seeing advertised . <sssss> it was the girlfriends idea to come here on nye before we hopefully went to a show at gammage . <sssss> so i called and made the reservations . <sssss> now i called sometime in november for the reservations and the person on the phone took all of my info and said `` it was down in the book '' but then i called the day of to confirm the reservation and the time and they did n't have a reservation for me . <sssss> uh oh . <sssss> this might have been a problem but they took all of my info again and honored the lost reservation at the time i wanted . <sssss> nice save . <sssss> when we arrived they had a booth all set for us . <sssss> it is a very nice place . <sssss> a little dark inside and old school but not old . <sssss> everything was well maintained and very clean . <sssss> no holes in anything or dust anywhere . <sssss> the booth was very nice . <sssss> plenty of room for two . <sssss> there were a lot of people there , hey it is nye . <sssss> at first i joked with my girlfriend that we were n't old enough to get into this place given the average age of everyone inside was well over 65 . <sssss> but although it was busy the service did not suffer at all . <sssss> our waitress was very nice . <sssss> our water glasses never even got close to empty and we were checked on just enough . <sssss> not too much to be pushy and not completely ignored . <sssss> my girlfriend , who had been here before , made all of the recommendations . <sssss> we started out with their cream spinach artichoke dip . <sssss> wow was this good . <sssss> so creamy . <sssss> i could have eaten a whole other bowl of it . <sssss> i think i am ruined on spinach artichoke dip from now on . <sssss> then on to the main course which of course had to be prime rib . <sssss> this was cooked perfectly . <sssss> just the way i like it . <sssss> it comes with creamy horseradish sauce which was good but i almost think the beef au jus they also give you was just a little better with it . <sssss> i also got the mashed potatoes , on recommendation , and they were very good as well . <sssss> everything was just excellent . <sssss> service , food , everything . <sssss> it may not be a five star restaurant but it deserves a five star review . <sssss> sure it is a little pricey but it was actually a little cheaper than i thought it would be . <sssss> plus it is worth it the price . <sssss> you do n't feel overcharged at all . <sssss> the food is so good it is worth the price . <sssss> we will definitely be back . <sssss> maybe not very frequently but we will be back .
?		i have never been here before and now i have been here twice in one week . <sssss> they have just remodeled the place , i have no idea what it looked like before , but from the pictures i think it looks better now . <sssss> the tables might be a little small so they can cram in more people but it is n't like you are having a full meal here just drinks usually . <sssss> i have to say the food is just ok . <sssss> of course i have only had the nachos and fried cheese . <sssss> the nachos were good but they had cheese sauce not melted cheese and for $ 13 i 'd expect melted cheese . <sssss> the fried cheese was nice big half slices of cheese but just not spectacular . <sssss> the drink prices are n't too bad . <sssss> it is a comedy club with a two drink min so you expect the prices to be a little high . <sssss> but if you just stick with the two drinks per person you can get out of there for about $ 30 to $ 35 . <sssss> add an app and it can get up to the $ 40 to $ 50 range for two people . <sssss> if you have four or a whole group the price could get up there fast but once you split it up it is n't too bad . <sssss> it is a nice club . <sssss> i do n't think there is a bad seat in the house . <sssss> the staff is very nice . <sssss> they do automatically add a tip on . <sssss> which i do n't know if that is a good thing or bad . <sssss> some people do n't like it . <sssss> i think it saves adding things up in your head and makes everyone tip which they should . <sssss> but i can see how it might rub some people the wrong way . <sssss> i will definitely be back . <sssss> i have become hooked . <sssss> they really put on a good show . <sssss> maybe not an every week thing but once in a while when someone you like comes to town or someone you do n't know . <sssss> you could be surprised . <sssss> i was there on sunday and had never heard of the comedian but he was great . <sssss> then last night david spade stopped in and did 15 minutes . <sssss> that was a real surprise . <sssss> so go and check it out . <sssss> enjoy and support live comedy .
?		i did n't even know this place existed . <sssss> i got a gift card from my boss for my birthday . <sssss> it was good for several places including this one . <sssss> since i did n't really like the other places and i had never heard of this one i decided to go with maggiano 's . <sssss> i was under the impression that this place was super fancy and you could only get in with reservations . <sssss> it is pretty fancy but reservations are not needed . <sssss> in fact they seemed to slow us down . <sssss> that got them minus one star right off the bat . <sssss> i will say that i did make the right choice and i thank my boss for introducing me to a new place that will go on my list of favorites . <sssss> my girlfriend had been here a few times before and also reassured me that i made the right choice . <sssss> they were pretty busy and it was a saturday night in scottsdale so you had to expect some wait time . <sssss> i also felt like the table they put us at was an after thought spare table that they threw out really quick so they could squeeze in two more . <sssss> it seemed out of place and up against a column . <sssss> it was a little cramped but it was fine . <sssss> i liked the décor of the restaurant . <sssss> very nice and upscale . <sssss> this is no garden of olives that is for sure . <sssss> i found it funny that as nice as this place was people were still in jeans and t-shirts and gym clothes . <sssss> really ? <sssss> you are going out to dinner . <sssss> at least put on some kind of nice clothes . <sssss> funny . <sssss> the bread they had was very good . <sssss> the service was great . <sssss> our waitress was very nice and got us everything we needed . <sssss> my girlfriend already knew what she wanted the same thing she gets every time she comes here the rigatoni d. i on the other hand being a newbie had trouble deciding . <sssss> some many things sounded good . <sssss> i finally picked the linguine with white clam sauce . <sssss> now i am not a fan of wine sauces , i much prefer cream sauces , but this was good . <sssss> clams in the shell which is nice . <sssss> a little work but still nice . <sssss> a lot of them too . <sssss> great flavor . <sssss> you do have to pay extra to get a salad . <sssss> i am a complete meal kind of person salad and an entrée maybe a dessert if there is room . <sssss> so to have to pay extra just to get a dinner salad is a little off putting but just a little . <sssss> we both really liked our meal . <sssss> i tried a little of what my girlfriend got and i think i will order that next time . <sssss> it had a white marsala sauce with mushrooms . <sssss> that blew my mind a little . <sssss> i have never seen a marsala sauce that was n't brown . <sssss> i will definitely be back . <sssss> great food . <sssss> great service . <sssss> really nice restaurant . <sssss> i ca n't wait to have an entire plate of their rigatoni d . <sssss> the prices were n't that bad either . <sssss> even without out the gift card is was no more expensive than any other place and it had much better food . <sssss> a better table , less of a wait and my own plate of rigatoni d might boost this place up to 5 stars .
?		five guys is so good . <sssss> have to admit that the first time i tried them i was not to impressed but on subsequent visits i have grown to really like them . <sssss> it seems there is a big five guys vs in n out thing going on but i do n't thing you can compare them . <sssss> they each have there own unique taste . <sssss> plus i do n't want to choose on over the other . <sssss> they are both great . <sssss> now five guys is just a little more expensive but just a little and it is so worth it . <sssss> also just a tip unless you really love french fries just order the small because they pile more than enough into the bag . <sssss> which is great but why pay for a large when you get enough with a small unless of course you want a ton of fries . <sssss> i know they have hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches but i have n't been able to get by the burgers yet . <sssss> they are so good . <sssss> i get it `` all the way '' except leave off the grilled mushrooms unless i am in the mood for them . <sssss> also a warning their regular burgers are doubles so unless you like double burgers make sure you let them know you want a single . <sssss> but the menu is fairly simple and you can get anything made the way you want it . <sssss> also if you want to hang out and eat there they have free peanuts . <sssss> the staff is always really nice . <sssss> you can see them make your food and the place is always clean . <sssss> just wish it was a little cheeper so i could eat there more often . <sssss> they also get an extra point because they have a coke freestyle machine .
?		never have i been to a pizza / bar in az better then here and i ca n't believe it 's taken me 20 ish years to finally give this spot a whirl . <sssss> pros : great pizza , cheap beer , waitresses that do n't stank , great appetizers , decent prices , perfect ora , great ufc bar , you can even bring your mom and dad here : -rrb- cons : i 'm not there with a cold draft in my hand the s. bro 's pizza combo was legit , heck everything we had tasted good and was hot . <sssss> the guy next to me smashed his king crab legs so i am sure you can find something you like here . <sssss> it 's worth your time , see ya there ! <sssss> edit : 9/25 / 11 i have been there a few times since and the service has been lacking . <sssss> i wish the staff would pay more attention , especially during the lunch rush . <sssss> i noticed they like to bunch up and talk and when you only have 30 minutes to eat and you ca n't get your check it tends to tick me off . <sssss> - asked for ranch and received a snappy response - people next to us tried to combine tables and was met by a rude waitress telling them they ca n't do it and almost to the point of yelling at them gave them no option except sitting in tables next to each other in a snappy fashion . <sssss> meh , i have experienced better
?		this place would make my grandma proud to live in az if she was still around drinking a bud light and playing the slots : -rrb- the buffet was to die for , but a little pricey at 25 a head . <sssss> the cigar room was perfect with a well set mood and nice slow jams being played live . <sssss> the casino was packed with thousands of people celebrating their life , or their downfall into addiction . <sssss> everyone seemed happy to be there though and i had a great time celebrating a birthday with the boys . <sssss> of all the casinos in az , this would be my only stop if it was n't for me dealing with rage in the cage at wild horse pass every now and then . <sssss> no live roulette is the only con , but the poker room more than makes up for it . <sssss> do n't expect to win squat , but have a blast at this feel good establishment : -rrb-
?		i like the atmosphere , it seems familiar but it 's not . <sssss> we tried the lunch special that was an open faced green chili meatloaf sandwich and the grilled salmon salad . <sssss> both dishes came out pretty as a picture with the food stacked high . <sssss> the meatloaf sandwich had mashed potatoes over the bread and a tasty cole slaw on top of the meatloaf . <sssss> unfortunately the potatoes were very over mixed and were extremely gummy . <sssss> the salmon salad overall was good and i am not sure if i did n't like the chive risotto cake or maybe the flavor of it clashed with the citrus dressing . <sssss> service was fine . <sssss> i would come back again but i am not in a hurry .
?		now i know why the tables have sleeping piggy lights on each table it is funny since they do n't serve pork . <sssss> -lrb- they are making fun of the guest because you feel that way after eating here -rrb- a giant whole squishy onion bread comes out to you right away with hard butter . <sssss> -lrb- this is enough for 6 people -rrb- we both ordered the most reasonably priced 3 course dinners upping one to a rib-eye -lrb- $ 9extra -rrb- the spring special till 9-30-11 $ 45 a special that is no longer on this location 's web-site but you can still get . <sssss> out comes our wedge salad -lrb- holy beep ! <sssss> -rrb- a whole trimmed head of lettuce -lrb- am i a pig ? <sssss> -rrb- all dressed up . <sssss> -lrb- this can feed 4 people -rrb- i picked blue cheese dressing and thought it seemed very heavy with lots of mayo not to mention many oz of good blue cheese . <sssss> i get my small -lrb- not really small -rrb- filet and it was good so i have to give at least 3 stars , so was the rib-eye also cooked nice . <sssss> the potato is some sort of giant monster potato that can feed 4 people but it was burnt of the bottom and we had asparagus that were cooked nice however the balsamic glazing was n't too tasty . <sssss> our specials came with this giant chocolate mousse that we both found to be extra heavy and not smooth but rich with chocolate . <sssss> i noticed most service was very good , ours was ok with our server maybe just not into being there . <sssss> -lrb- a fluke -rrb- we did n't get the morton 's educational speech with the cart or and all and was only checked on by server when taking first bite of steak . <sssss> we had a $ 100 gift card and still spent close to $ 100 with drinks tax tip ordering the least expensive dinners so it is fair to say for a couple plan on $ 200 up up and up ! <sssss> the steaks really were very good but the rest over all ok or meh i had better ? <sssss> and oink oink zzzzzzzzzz
?		if i base my review on just the tacos at their price point two stars is accurate . <sssss> their were lots of things i did like about sol mexican cocina . <sssss> they present you with above average salsas and and spiced toastadas . <sssss> the margaritas were good and strong but maybe pricey . <sssss> -lrb- $ 10.50 and $ 13.75 -rrb- i loved the warmed goat cheese with salted peanuts and that sweet hot chipotle syrup it was like whipped cream cheese but tastier and all that sweet salty and spicy went really well together . <sssss> it is worth coming here just for the goat cheese . <sssss> the grilled corn was good ! <sssss> not the best i 've ever had but good ! <sssss> they are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians . <sssss> service is above average as our server amanda was very knowledgeable and informative and seemed well trained . <sssss> now the tacos . <sssss> the tacos are baja style street tacos . <sssss> they are very small tacos . <sssss> my husband had the sampler plate and i ordered two ala carte tacos so together we tried five kinds . <sssss> we tried chicken , beef , pork , fish and vegetable . <sssss> for the most part the tacos were just meh but the stand outs were the pork and fish tacos . <sssss> we spent $ 30.25 on 8 mini tiny tacos . <sssss> the chicken was the most undesirable but passable . <sssss> the chicken was sort of dry and not so tasty . <sssss> the beef one could have been more flavorful but was ok . <sssss> the vegetable -lrb- corn & rajas -rrb- taco was full of just mooch as it lacked flavor and texture . <sssss> the wild caught fish taco was yellow tail on my visit . <sssss> the tiny taco was tasty but the fish was over cooked -lrb- $ 7.50 -rrb- and it seemed expensive to me for such a tiny taco with very little fish in it . <sssss> your best bet is to come for happy hour and take advantage of it .
?		short story execution of food was perfect . <sssss> flavors and seasonings were spot on . <sssss> some unexpected elements of surprise moves the food past four stars . <sssss> perfect portions , not too much not too little . <sssss> atmosphere maybe is n't quite five stars but i was happy with the food . <sssss> long story they started us off with the most amusing looking amuse bouche i 've ever seen . <sssss> a tiny piece of a cherry tomato on a bunch of tiny plates . <sssss> but wow that tiny morsel of tomato was packed with a mouthful of flavor . <sssss> the spicy sausage was very good and the chick peas were clearly not of the canned variety and seemed like cooked and then maybe roasted nicely with a crispness . <sssss> the simple salad really was n't so simple as it was made of high end ingredients such as endive , apples , marcona almonds , garrotxa cheese . <sssss> the careful slicing of the ingredients made the texture interesting and the vinaigrette was so bright and fresh and perfect the salad was outstanding . <sssss> the pasta was perfect and light with the right texture and made with local hayden farms semolina flour.i had to ask about the pasta because it looked darker than semolina it really was interesting . <sssss> i thought the beef short rib ragu was perfect not fatty but cooked down with perfect seasonings . <sssss> prosciutto wrapped fennel and cheese stuffed pork loin was prepared perfect being moist and flavored well . <sssss> they gave us a giant bowl of green apple cotton candy . <sssss> ricotta fritters were yummy ! <sssss> the triple chocolate flan really did n't seem like flan but had the taste of pots de creme but not the mouth feel being what seemed like lighter . <sssss> it had these praline rice crisps that sort of tasted like hazelnut that were yummy and on the side was a salty buttery cookie that went well with it . <sssss> they gave us chocolate chip shortbread cookies to take home . <sssss> i was very happy with the food and service . <sssss> the dining room is a little dark and i almost needed a flashlight to read the menu . <sssss> tables are close together . <sssss> this is a small restaurant in a strip mall .
?		this is a family -lrb- jordanian back round -rrb- owned and operated store with over 30 years food experience from chicago . <sssss> the owners are more than nice as they are cheerful friendly and offered me a taste of the exotic produce such as green almonds and tiny green plums that look like green cherries how interesting and rare is that ! <sssss> the foods we tried were great and flavorful . <sssss> we had the vegetarian plate # 2 and beef kabob platter . <sssss> the hummus and babaghrooj -lrb- i used same spelling as menu -rrb- were so neat and pretty with a tasty oil dip built in and some sort of grind-ed mildly spicy pickled green pepper in the middle , these were the most delish i 've had and the felafel 's were so light but crispy on the outside i was n't sure if they were made with fava beans or a combo since they were green and the tahini sauce was the very best i 've ever had all these were seasoned so perfect that is what made them so good . <sssss> the beef kabob plate was great too great tasty beef nicely cooked onions and peppers with rice , pita and a salad . <sssss> we had to share one of their desserts it was a tiny pastry filled with pistachios and dipped in chocolate . <sssss> this place is not fancy but it appears to be clean . <sssss> this is a halal so no pork is in this market . <sssss> this is -lrb- almost fast casual but you do eat on real plates the food is made fresh to order a few minutes -rrb- and it is very reasonably priced . <sssss> this place is five stars special if you are open to this kind of food you will agree .
?		this time i was unsure between four and five stars but it was close so i went with five because most times everything is usually nailed . <sssss> it is very hard to pass on the prix fixe $ 25.00 three course menu and both of us went with it again . <sssss> it 's kind of fun to get the whole caboodle for only $ 25.00 and so what if it is n't a hipster crowd that dines here as we were the only non senior citizens here who cares ! <sssss> they start you off with warm fresh buttery flakey miniature croissants . <sssss> we shared a nicely presented beet and goat cheese napoleon that was garnished with walnuts . <sssss> next we shared very earthy mini mushroom raviolis garnished with fresh tarragon . <sssss> i went with the beef tenderloin with green peppercorn sauce . <sssss> the beef was tasty and tender but petite -lrb- my guess is two oz . <sssss> -rrb- the sauce was rich with butter and brandy but did lack a pepper taste and salt but was very tasty as is . <sssss> the vegetables were hot fresh and crisp . <sssss> the labor intensive potatoes dauphinoise were creamy and garlicky and maybe a little heavy handed with the garlic this time but still good . <sssss> my husband went with the lobster and he said it was cooked perfect . <sssss> they called my dessert a raspberry pots de cream , it was a rich custard studded with raspberries and did have a thin layer of caramelized sugar . <sssss> the chocolate mousse was rich with chocolate . <sssss> this place is n't for everyone because of the petite proteins gives you that is a french style of eating feel . <sssss> but in my opinion it is petite done right . <sssss> you do n't need a lot along with everything else and the rich sauces . <sssss> this place is a winner !
?		the most delicious thai dish i ever tried was the spicy pumpkin basil with chicken from lao thai . <sssss> that kabocha squash -lrb- japanese pumpkin -rrb- has the taste of a chestnut mixed with sweet potato . <sssss> the sauce is a very balanced sauce with perfect spice heat the right amount of sweetness and flavors to knock you out . <sssss> we also had the pad ga pow and that one was good as well . <sssss> lao thai uses thai chilies in their dishes instead of jalapenos for a more authentic taste and features many spicy dishes and also seafood . <sssss> i do need to mention the portion we just had was smaller than other places and had less protein so if you need leftovers this is not for you . <sssss> lao thai is among the cleanest of restaurants i 've been in . <sssss> it was a pleasure dining here .
?		oy caramba ! <sssss> the last time i ate at one of these caramba 's someone there highly recommended getting the salpicon salad saying that it was delicious and tasty and he thought it was the best dish they make . <sssss> it 's listed as a salad so i was expecting a salad . <sssss> i did ask them to leave off the cheese and sour cream to lighten it up a little for me . <sssss> but all this salad appeared to be a fried flour tortilla smeared with beans topped with a small amount of lettuce with a very small amount of fresh made plastic tub like chunks of chicken and topped with a big glob of guacamole . <sssss> to me it looked like a tostada . <sssss> it was a $ 6.25 tostada . <sssss> i read on a sign that the chicken and a bunch of other stuff is made fresh every day and is never from frozen . <sssss> i also did n't eat the fried tortilla the food seemed fresh but it was a small amount of food . <sssss> two stars for the chicken salpicon salad i also had a margarita and it was so strong i thought i tasted antifreeze in it and i also thought it might make me grow hair on my chest . <sssss> my husband liked the carnitas plate . <sssss> he said it was nicely seasoned and the meat was moist . <sssss> it came with rice and beans and a giant flour tortilla that could hold a small body . <sssss> i 'll leave them at three stars because my husband liked the carnitas here . <sssss> we were going to have a donut next door at lamar 's but it was after 12 and they were almost out so you might want to check out lamar 's before lunch . <sssss> all the caramba locations are open everyday for lunch or dinner .
?		sophisticated refined asian tea house that is in a turn of the century bungalow serving very reasonably priced well crafted foods . <sssss> we decided to try for lunch and were told the plates were small so we ordered three plates to share but really two plates would be enough . <sssss> we started with the grilled tofu salad , with udon noodles , cucumber , and greens . <sssss> the tofu was marinated and very lightly grilled and it , along with the noodles picked up most of the flavor of the dressing . <sssss> -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- the short rib steamed buns were like sandwiches not stuffed like buns and had precision cut tokyo negi -lrb- onion -rrb- inside them with house made pickles -lrb- celery -rrb- the meat in the bun had a most perfect tasty char but was also marinated and for some people the taste of the marinate is an acquired taste , do n't misunderstand it was good but fish essence was part of the flavor . <sssss> the steamed fresh bun was the best i ever had and we were served two sandwiches so again this was a generous portion . <sssss> -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- the most impressive bursting with pleasing flavors plate we had was the panko fried soft shell crab on house made foccia served with side of fennel cole slaw . <sssss> perfect in preparation , great pops of taste with kanzuri aiol -lrb- asian red pepper paste -rrb- i think purple shiso herb -lrb- minty fennel like basil -rrb- and cucumber sandwich . <sssss> my only thought is this was perfect and did n't need the dressing on both sides of sandwich . <sssss> the house made focaccia bun was so light and fresh and the herb that was used under the top bun that i think was shiso transformed and elevated the taste tremendously . <sssss> the fennel cole slaw was the best i ever had and was like fireworks in your mouth it was delicious . <sssss> -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- some plates are a whisper and some plates are a scream , service was exceptionally good . <sssss> the menu is limited so you need to examine before you dine .
?		everything is always good here but the nutmeg italian ice is mind blowing crazy good ! <sssss> if that stuff was sold in tubs at the supermarket bunches would be sold . <sssss> the texture was like slightly compacted snow that seemed light as air . <sssss> the flavor was not too sweet but perfect with an unexpected something refreshing about it . <sssss> this place is different from the other bianco restaurants and is my favorite . <sssss> everything is always good and this place really has soul . <sssss> it so far has always been good for lunch and the few times i 've been here for dinner and my last pizza was better here than from the pizzeria . <sssss> i always just sat out at the outside tables but this time we decided to try out the dining room . <sssss> my husband had the sopressata sandwich and it was great the way it always is . <sssss> i had the tuna salad and it seemed better than usual maybe because it was served on a real plate instead of the plastic container . <sssss> we shared the focaccia it was very good it was a cheddar , red onion , and tomato focaccia . <sssss> 4.5 stars
?		the atmosphere is mostly hip and modern and not your daddy 's steakhouse . <sssss> you have to park in the garage as we did or valet park to dine here . <sssss> we shared the ahi tuna tacos . <sssss> they were fresh and were a generous portion . <sssss> i liked the spiciness in them but the shells were very unique to me and i could n't identify what they were so i had to ask . <sssss> they are whole wheat won ton wrappers . <sssss> most people might not notice the difference between them and regular tortillas but i would have liked to read that on the menu so i 'd know what to except because the texture and taste was very unexpected to me . <sssss> my companion said the veal meatloaf was very good being moist fresh and flavorful adorned with wild mushrooms and bordelaise sauce . <sssss> he said if we came back he most likely would order this again . <sssss> i was seated near the cow portrait and ordered beef anyway since this is a steakhouse but did feel a little guilty eating steak looking into that cow face . <sssss> my steakhouse salad arrived and it was attractive , came with deviled eggs and made with very fresh greens . <sssss> just the right amount of cheese was on it and it was very lightly dressed the way i like it but the steak on it was cold and i imagined it might have been made earlier in the day . <sssss> my waiter was super very attentive and saw right threw me when i said the said was ok meaning not great but i will eat it anyway . <sssss> to my surprise he got the manager over and i told here how the steak was and she did generously offer to bring me a new one without making me feel bad . <sssss> i did decline because my companion had a nice meal he was enjoying i already ate two pieces and only had a few pieces left and just wanted to make do and like i already mentioned the salad part was good . <sssss> if the circumstances were dinner i would have sent it back . <sssss> i think some people would have given this place five stars since the manager took my salad off the bill and handed some coupons for appetizers to come back but my reviews are truthful and i tell it like it was . <sssss> i do note they wanted to try again and make my meal better but the truth is i was served a nice salad but the steak was n't the way i liked it . <sssss> the waiter and manager were very above average in hospitality . <sssss> this review is based on only one lunch visit and three stars is a positive review but recommended with reservations .
?		very torn on this one around 3.5 stars service 5 stars cheese plate 3-4 stars hanger steak 3 stars special grouper almost 5 stars special of the day gnocchi about 2 stars dessert 4-5 stars the cheese plate was a small mound of house made ricotta -lrb- good and very drained -rrb- a small mound of goat cheese and a chunk of cheddar and another one that was more tasty than the cheddar served with a large amount of crust slices . <sssss> we choose the option to add fruit . <sssss> the hanger steak was not the most tender steak but that is our fault for picking medium rare when it would be more tender cooked more . <sssss> this steak was served in a reduced wine sauce with a large amount of sauteed shallots and to the person that ordered this dish they seemed fine for several bites but he said it was more noticeable while getting into the dish that many shallots were n't cooked and he got a strong raw shallot taste from them that kept building and stayed many hours latter . <sssss> special catch was grouper it was seasoned and cooked perfect with some greens and tiny thin multi color carrots on a buttery mild red wine sauce , this dish was delicious . <sssss> the side of special of the day house made gnocchi was in a tomato and cream sauce heavy with -lrb- i think she said -rrb- shishito peppers and read the description as mild but warned us that she tasted one and it was hot as a jalapeno , we decided to try anyway . <sssss> the gnocchi were fried and each had a brown crispy side , the sauce was rich creamy , slightly smokey and i thought had essence of meat ? <sssss> but when you ate a pepper that were cut large this was more like double spicy than a jalapeno and the dish had maybe fifty pieces of this pepper but they were thrown in at the end so it did n't develop into the sauce but would be inedible as is . <sssss> we did mention this to our sever . <sssss> this meal was not well thought out very overly powering in flavor even if the peppers were milder ... maybe truly a one star ... ? <sssss> we had to order the famous chocolate tower we saw on the television show check please , it was impressive looking and enjoyable . <sssss> we maybe expected to be overwhelmed more because everything we saw on the tv show looked very delicious and impressive . <sssss> you must stop by the restroom area and see the floating wall that drips water over stones that you use as the rest room sink , both the men and the women share the sink and it is very interesting .
?		short story two of the pastas we tried were very thick and heavy with a paste like texture and flavors were disappointing . <sssss> long story we were excited to try this place again after reading all the great new reviews . <sssss> we were welcomed nicely by the hostess and our servers were very cordial and efficient and we were surprised by a tasty amushe bouche of olive oiled crustini with a light spreading of cheese . <sssss> we had a hard time deciding on what to order because really only one traditional type dinner plate was on the menu so we ordered a cheese plate while we took some time to decide . <sssss> we received delicious crusty bread with high quality olive oil and the cheese plate adorned with very good accompaniments . <sssss> we had the pasta fagioli soup . <sssss> this variation of soup was made with dark beans and seemed to not include the usual seasonings and vegetables such as tomato , celery and onion and the stock . <sssss> the soup seemed extremely rustic and mostly was just cooked beans . <sssss> the pasta in it looked like rolled by hand orecchiette , each one was very heavy and thick regular flour pasta that had a paste like texture . <sssss> the peach and arugula salad was very good and large . <sssss> we ordered the one dinner plate of the evening that included roasted chicken legs and thighs , shriner 's sausage , cold potato salad and pickles . <sssss> the chicken was ok , the sausage was a little over grilled . <sssss> the potato salad was n't delicious . <sssss> we also ordered the eggplant strozzapreti also know as priest choker pasta . <sssss> again just like the pasta from the soup this pasta was also a hand rolled regular flour pasta but the shape of strozzapreti is an elongated cavatelli shape . <sssss> each piece of pasta was approximately the size and heaviness and thickness as a solid green bean . <sssss> after i ate one i really did n't feel up to any more . <sssss> i did pick the vegetables out and ate them . <sssss> i thought even with improvements this visit was a step down . <sssss> if we made different selections we might have had a more positive experience .
?		if someone can read chinese please take a look at the menu board photo and contact me to what i saw as i might have to change my rating and one of my list . <sssss> if you order from the chinese menu and not the american chinese menu items your food might be tongue thrilling spicy and your mouth might get numb . <sssss> we got started with the sauteed spicy cucumbers . <sssss> they were so crispy spicy and refreshing and were a nice start . <sssss> i had the water boiled chicken and it was the spiciest food i ever had in my life . <sssss> it was so spicy i felt high and my head was flooded with euphoria . <sssss> my mouth went numb . <sssss> i had this dish twice here before once with chicken and once with fish and neither time before was it this kind of spicy . <sssss> it really was too spicy for me this time so i took home my leftovers and will thin it down for latter . <sssss> the chicken in this dish was tender like no other place makes chicken . <sssss> this really was an experience . <sssss> our waiter highly recommended the hot spicy beef with pickled vegetables . <sssss> the beef was very good and very tender like the chicken was and it also was a spicy dish but at a more comfortable level . <sssss> portions were large and generous . <sssss> service was pleasant -lrb- this time -rrb- but you only drink water unless you order a beer . <sssss> they do n't clear your plates when you are done either . <sssss> it 's an experience !
?		my review might be slightly more helpful because i was n't here on a wednesday night for the phenomenal wednesday special like almost everybody else was here for . <sssss> the menu is very limited and for the most part you are going to order a pizza or a burger and drink wine or one of the many craft brews they feature . <sssss> i ca n't say we had the best burgers out there anywhere because i have n't been everywhere but i can say we had some doozies of very good burgers priced less than vegas and better than what we had in las vegas at one of those specialty burger places . <sssss> ivan burger $ 12.00 hangover burger $ 14.00 most craft brews run an average $ 8.00 vs. las vegas close to $ 20.00 a burger they only have a couple burgers to pick from on the menu and they can be altered slightly . <sssss> i went with the famous ivan burger . <sssss> it is extremely large and is a half pound burger patty with the usual lettuce , tomato , onion , choice of cheese chipotle mayo on a pretzel bun . <sssss> it comes with tasty battered fries . <sssss> my burger was cooked a perfect medium just like i asked for and had a nice crust . <sssss> it was a very juicy burger but not too much as it did n't fall apart . <sssss> the pretzel bun was strong enough to support all the weight of the sandwich fillings . <sssss> it really was a tasty burger . <sssss> i think at least half the people out there might think like me and admit the burger is too large . <sssss> i split the burger in half because i knew that would be plenty . <sssss> but would have enjoyed it more if it was smaller so it would be easier to manage . <sssss> for me it was very thick and still delicious but too thick . <sssss> my husband tried the hangover burger . <sssss> it 's basically an ivan burger but with an added egg and he said really good bacon . <sssss> i do n't know how he ate that whole sandwich but he did and said he had to because it was really good . <sssss> the attic is located above a sandwich shop and uses the name cave and ives on the outside of the building and on the receipts . <sssss> the steps are easy to climb but if you are handicapped an elevator is available . <sssss> the burgers we had were very good ! <sssss> the pizzas looked good ! <sssss> lots of craft beers .
?		this was a nice stop in a good location of old town scottsdale very convenient to the farmers market . <sssss> we decided to start with the grilled cheese salad to share . <sssss> the salad had a grilled cheese sandwich cut up in small cubes all over it . <sssss> some of the cubes were , soft , some were crunchy , and some were burnt . <sssss> the salad was fresh but not very flavorful despite the very nice pickled onions in it . <sssss> overall the salad was ok and big and good as an entree or large enough to share . <sssss> we also decided to share the house made pastrami sandwich on locally made rye bread because it sounded good . <sssss> the style of the pastrami was more smoked and had a harder dryer texture than the warmed spicy melt in your mouth type style that i was sort of was expecting . <sssss> i 'm not saying it was bad but just not what i was expecting . <sssss> but i do have to say they should warn you that they put yellow mustard on this sandwich . <sssss> yellow mustard is not traditionally ever on a pastrami sandwich and for me the yellow mustard really does n't cut it . <sssss> i suggest if you order this sandwich ask for the mustard on the side and see what you think . <sssss> the rye bread however was much better than most rye bread most places serve . <sssss> the fries that came with the sandwich were maybe the most perfect fries i remember ever trying , they were five star fries ! <sssss> hot and fresh with skins , seasoned lightly but perfect , a light perfect crispness , but soft fluffy not a trace of grease . <sssss> i found the employees very welcoming and cordial , they are very new and are maybe just still working things out . <sssss> i 'll give them another try sometime .
?		the duck pond was my favorite part , but it is kind of dirty and lacking pond plants for the turtles that live there . <sssss> if you are shopping along this strip and need a break this will do because it is not the worst but also not the best in american style mexican cuisine . <sssss> we thought we were going to try the $ 14.95 buffet but took a peek and decided against it because nothing to use looked appetizing and there were very few choices i think only 6 buffet pans plus an omelet station . <sssss> they gave us the chips and the 3 sauces so maybe it 's just me but all 3 sauces had an unusual ingredient added that i did n't care for . <sssss> my chicken fajita salad came and i do note this was the greasiest and oiliest one i have ever had it was very generous with peppers and onions and red cabbage that i picked out because dripping with oil . <sssss> the chicken had an odd texture sort of dried out but juicy like a dry sponge with liquid . <sssss> my salad also came with mexican style sour cream and guacamole . <sssss> i asked for the re fried beans on the side and my husband tried them he said they were just unseasoned whipped beans that really needed some salt . <sssss> my husband tried the carnitas and thought the actual pork was ok but the black beans that came with it just had an awful smoke flavor to them and he also was n't a fan of the corn tortillas . <sssss> he was having gastric problems the next day and thought it was from here since i was fine and it was the only food we had different the day before . <sssss> -lrb- so it seemed like kind of visiting mexico for real -rrb- i ca n't say positively that this was from here just a guess . <sssss> if you dine here a table would be better than a booth because you will have a better view of the ducks , swans and turtles .
?		when the menu includes `` large intestine '' , you know it 's got to be good . <sssss> well , not necessarily but you at least have an inkling it 's not going to be the typical american chinese menu . <sssss> despite having spent a year in mainland china quite some years ago , i did not find myself drawn to `` large intestine '' , no matter how authentic , and our gang of four settled elsewhere on the menu to happy results all around . <sssss> every dish was excellent , absolutely exceptional in a totally positive way , and i look forward to returning for more as soon as i 've recovered from my foray to the szechuan side of the menu . <sssss> sure , `` hot n sour '' soup is a chinese restaurant staple , but this one took the eye-watering , nose-running spicy-hot cake . <sssss> -lrb- disclaimer : no warranty on over - stretched metaphors and aphorisms -rrb- unfortunately `` hot '' does n't like me anymore , but this was so good i elected to repair to the car for a shot of non-denominational pink bismuth solution in order that i should be able to consume more without immediate threat to self or community at large . <sssss> it was so worth it . <sssss> i 'll be back with more specifics on the dishes we tried , but highly recommend the glutinous rice balls with the sweet sesame paste dessert . <sssss> delightful in itself , a light , not `` heavy '' , lightly sweet dessert , a wonderful compliment to the meal as well as a utilitarian palate-cleansing restorative to the spice-numbed tongue , though from a marketing perspective i might recommend they come up with a more appetizing pseudonym for `` glutinous rice balls '' . <sssss> `` large intestine '' perhaps ? <sssss> highly recommend . <sssss> a genuine find . <sssss> service was friendly and helpful . <sssss> ambiance : bare , but clean . <sssss> dining area and mens ' room : clean . <sssss> conveniently adjacent to light rail stop . <sssss> open until 10pm . <sssss> be warned of easy-to-miss narrow driveway between buildings off north side of apache . <sssss> p.s. cousin , brace yourself - this to be your belated birthday dinner ! <sssss> p.s. 2 : a shamefully belated but heaping helping of `` thank you '' to norm r. for the introduction and meal !
?		very , very good . <sssss> attractive decor - clean & modern without being stark -lrb- or bizarre -rrb- . <sssss> great atmosphere . <sssss> food was excellent and spiced to order . <sssss> very reasonably priced . <sssss> service was friendly , competent , and attentive . <sssss> men 's room clean and in good order . <sssss> would definitely return .
?		it 's not the biggest or highest echelon of merchandise among the costcos in the area , and chris-town spectrum mall , home of the first costco-in-a-mall experiment is kind of `` modest '' in itself , so i 'll save that 5th star for the bigger , uppity-er ones because despite my most fervent lifelong hopes , apparently size does matter . <sssss> this is however my most regular haven for lifetime supply quantity shopping , and i have no complaints and plenty of compliments for this store and staff . <sssss> much of the staff has been there some years now and we know each other on sight , and some by name . <sssss> it 's kind of nice to go somewhere where if not everybody , at least somebody knows your name -lrb- thanks , dan -lsb- and `` cheers '' -rsb- -rrb- . <sssss> hard working people , clean store , and a well-stocked men 's room that 's always clean . <sssss> it 's worth joining just for the rotisserie chicken alone . <sssss> have you tried one of those dried dead birds from one of the groceries with the outdoor smokers ? <sssss> blackened and so dehydrated you 'd think the bird had been taxidermied ? <sssss> this is n't that . <sssss> costco 's big plump , juicy , perfectly cooked , perfectly seasoned every time chicken , and still -lrb- i think -rrb- $ 4.99 , is justifiably famous in itself . <sssss> it 's consistently just ridiculously good . <sssss> they 've got the formula down , and if you 've got a formula that works - do n't mess with it . <sssss> this store also has outlying gas pumps and tire shop , pharmacy , optometrist and optical department , photo services , inkjet cartridge refills , groceries of course , and more . <sssss> there 's a reason -lrb- or many -rrb- that the 800 number for costco is on my phone as `` my beloved costco '' , and despite the increased panhandling in the parking lot at spectrum lately , this store is one of those reasons . <sssss> just do n't mess with my bird .
?		i found our server to be completely fake , and somewhat condescending . <sssss> she just seemed to tolerate our party of 2 . <sssss> she was less than attentive , providing no plates or silverware for our appetizers - i remedied the situation by getting them myself . <sssss> the margarita was very good and a fair value during happy hour , which was not crowded at all .
?		stopped in again last sunday before picking someone up at the airport . <sssss> breakfast was flawless -lrb- again -rrb- . <sssss> i had the hog and chick this time and was very happy . <sssss> hashbrowns were crispy , but not burnt . <sssss> eggs were scrambled and fluffy . <sssss> the jam of the day was strawberry , and some of the best i have ever had . <sssss> love me some sourdough toast & jam . <sssss> i waited less than 5 minutes -lrb- it was only me -rrb- , sat at the bar , and enjoyed swift , friendly service . <sssss> coffee was fine but not great . <sssss> if matt 's is going to improve , i say the coffee is where to start .
?		this really is n't the best pita jungle out there . <sssss> the food is great , but i rarely get my food the way i order it . <sssss> servers are kind , but seem overwhelmed during lunch - often we get our food and do n't see a server again until we 're ready for our check . <sssss> i ca n't give them less than 3 stars because i really , really like the food , but i wish it would come to me the way i order it more often .
?		this place reminds me of my first job , a hostess in a now closed chinese restaurant in chandler . <sssss> everything was exactly the same - the teapots , the placemats ... ahhh , the memories . <sssss> lunch specials were $ 5.95 and $ 6.95 and were a great value - they included the main course plus two wontons , soup or salad , an egg roll and white or fried rice . <sssss> everything was very clean and service was extra friendly and quick . <sssss> drink refills were prompt . <sssss> i ordered the flamingo special chicken and i could n't believe the amount of food i received - double what i expected . <sssss> the hot and sour soup was really good , and really hot with lots of tofu chunks . <sssss> the flamingo chicken is fried chicken in a garlic and onion sauce ... yummy ! <sssss> like daren , i did n't find any crappy chicken in my dish either ... it was all white meat , not over fried or dry . <sssss> i did not like the egg roll , but i rarely do - i think they taste like raisins a lot of the time . <sssss> wontons were crispy and yummy and the rice was fresh . <sssss> this is my new favorite chinese place for lunch . <sssss> yay flamingo ! <sssss> keep in mind lunch specials are monday - friday only .
?		i 'm really frustrated . <sssss> my last delivery order arrived with the wrong pretzels . <sssss> i do n't like salt on my pretzels . <sssss> neither does g. my last dine in experience was -lrb- except our darling server -rrb- a disaster . <sssss> we waited at least 15 minutes for a server , after requesting one twice . <sssss> we waited another 15 minutes for drinks . <sssss> our appetizers arrived before our drinks . <sssss> we watched an appetizer sit on the pass for a looooong time . <sssss> we were served the same cold appetizer , even after quizzing the manager-type expediter on how long they had been sitting there -lrb- we knew the answer -rrb- . <sssss> our -lrb- super awesome -rrb- server wasted no time correcting the situation . <sssss> i really like the food at the mellow mushroom -lrb- when it is what i ordered and is served at an appropriate temperature -rrb- . <sssss> that 's why i 've ordered delivery , take out and dined in at least 10 times . <sssss> i 'm really not trying to be cranky , but honestly , the food only gets mellow so far .
?		service : 2 stars food : 4 stars the food was awesome . <sssss> my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed it . <sssss> i loved the free chips and salsa . <sssss> bean dip was also offered , but it was kinda meh to me . <sssss> i had the enchiladas suizas . <sssss> she had the chimichanga . <sssss> my enchiladas were crazy yummy - fantastically tangy tomatillo sauce , tender chicken , soft corn tortillas and a healthy amount of cheese with sour cream on the side . <sssss> my beans were covered in cheese and the rice was really , really good . <sssss> she said she really liked her chicken chimi , and it showed - she ate every bite of it . <sssss> now , let 's get to the service side of this lovely experience . <sssss> i asked for a margarita recommendation ; server could n't come up with one . <sssss> i decided to stick with water ; my friend ordered diet pepsi . <sssss> after 3 requests -lrb- to two different people -rrb- and 20 minutes , the diet pepsi finally arrived . <sssss> like i said , my friend really liked the chimi , it was n't what she ordered . <sssss> she ordered the 2 chimi plate , one chicken , one beef . <sssss> oh well . <sssss> the bill was cheap ... around $ 24 for the two of us . <sssss> the food was ready fast and like i said , it was really , really good . <sssss> i know this is kinda inconsequential , but i still think it is worth mentioning : i absolutely hate it when restaurants print the calculated 10 % , 15 % and 20 % gratuity amounts on the receipt . <sssss> tacky , tacky , tacky ! <sssss> and a really bad way to end a tasty meal .
?		i thought `` corporate sushi '' no fucking way !! <sssss> i have been a fan of blue wasabi and ra was a go to for me . <sssss> i love sashimi and eat it about twice a month . <sssss> so my friend and i decided to try kabuki as an option to the latter . <sssss> when we walked in my first impression was this place was alot more open , brighter and better decorated than ra and bw . <sssss> it had no smell which is a great sign . <sssss> i went out of my usual realm of hamachi sashimi and uni . <sssss> i actually ordered an entree for the first time at a sushi joint . <sssss> i want to tell you that what i had was a 5 star dish . <sssss> i am a sucker for chilean sea bass . <sssss> it 's buttery , flaky , holds flavor well and tastes absolutely deliciuos . <sssss> this place did not fail to impress . <sssss> i loved the freshness . <sssss> it was cooked perfect and the sauce was out of this world . <sssss> one of the best sea bass dishes i have ever had and i have eaten this dish all over the country ! <sssss> if you love chilean sea bass do not pass this up . <sssss> it is my guarentee you will be shocked that a corporation could create such a flavourfull dish !!
?		sweet spot ... . <sssss> . <sssss> no it 's not ! <sssss> c'mon , it 's pink . <sssss> it 's got ice cream inside . <sssss> it 's retro . <sssss> everything here screams `` this place is tubular , hip , rad , cool , tight , phat '' so whats the deal ? <sssss> first off , i was under the impression they had homemade ice cream . <sssss> they do n't . <sssss> it 's dreyers . <sssss> with canned whipped toppings , canned cherries , canned sauces ... nothing here is unique ! <sssss> aha , besides the decor ! <sssss> i blew through 1500 calories + for garbage . <sssss> i was very dissapointed . <sssss> so let me get on to the dish i had . <sssss> i ate half of `` the top hat '' . <sssss> described as a creampuff stuffed with rich vanilla ice cream and covered with hot chocolate . <sssss> sounds good does n't it ? <sssss> the cream puff shell which should be light and fluffy with a `` slight '' pull was extremely tough , flavorless , dry and i am assuming old ! <sssss> how can they even call it a cream puff when the best part -lrb- the cream -rrb- is non existent ? <sssss> so my dry ball was filled with dreyers ice cream . <sssss> not good . <sssss> we actually ate lunch first . <sssss> they have an `` american '' menu . <sssss> egg salad , blt , burgers , tuna , grilled cheese etc. ... . <sssss> the problem is nothing was good . <sssss> i ordered a patty melt . <sssss> the burger was tasteless and very , very small . <sssss> id say about the size patty you would find on a mcdonalds kids cheeseburger . <sssss> the kicker ... no fries . <sssss> no fries ? <sssss> what the fuck ? <sssss> chips?stick these chips in some ice cream and get creative . <sssss> daughter had a blt , two strips , yes , two strips of bacon on wonder bread . <sssss> coleslaw was the worst i have ever had ! <sssss> this place just sucks . <sssss> huge upset for a place i was really looking forward to . <sssss> i try to review the food as much as possible but i have to say this about the service . <sssss> ssllooww ! <sssss> we had a group of 8 and our waitress could only bring out 2 drinks at a time . <sssss> 4 damn trips to just get our drinks . <sssss> they charge for refills too ! <sssss> i guess that is how they keep that nostalgic feel because restaurants have not been charging refills since the days of the flood !
?		garbage ! <sssss> but hey , the portions of it are huge !!! <sssss> sorry , i ca n't testify to any dishes here .
?		wow . <sssss> even lafayette , la born hubby was seriously impressed with flavors of louisiana . <sssss> the restaurant was far from full on a saturday night , but the customers came in steadily . <sssss> it is a small place , but very clean , and rather sparsely decorated . <sssss> at least you can taste right away where their priorities are . <sssss> hubby had the special of the night - three pieces of tender , perfectly cooked catfish smothered in crawfish etoufee . <sssss> he had asked for , and was told that he would receive etoufee only , but got the special anyway . <sssss> he loved it , but this mix-up is the reason for the 4 stars . <sssss> even though it was in a darker roux , which he normally does not prefer , he licked his plate clean . <sssss> i got the shrimp po ` boy which came in a large basket with fries . <sssss> it was two 6 '' halves of a fresh baguette with lettuce , tomato , a zippy sauce , and plenty of perfectly cooked battered and fried shrimp . <sssss> our dining companions had an equally huge and tasty fried oyster po ` boy , a side of fresh and tangy cole slaw , and a bowl of delicious seafood gumbo . <sssss> nothing was spicy , just super flavorful . <sssss> the boys got the peach cobbler dessert , and even though we girls both said we did n't much care for peach cobbler , we certainly helped the boys polish off the big bowls when they got to the table . <sssss> even though fol is quite a drive for us , we will be back very soon . <sssss> please note that as of october 1 , 2009 , they will be closing early on saturday nights - 8:00 instead of 9:00 pm .
?		meh . <sssss> everything was fine , edible , decent `` home cookin ' '' . <sssss> hubby had the pot pie which had great tasting filling but a tough crust . <sssss> since i wo n't be headed to saugatuck , mi this summer , i wo n't be able to get my annual open faced roast beef at the kalico kitchen . <sssss> so i decided to give mother 's version a try . <sssss> not too shabby . <sssss> dinners come with a lot of bread and butter , and some come with a trip to the salad bar . <sssss> hubby really liked their cole slaw . <sssss> then , we fought over pie . <sssss> i wanted coconut cream , but hubby sat there dejectedly until i relented on the chocolate peanut butter . <sssss> damn manipulator . <sssss> the filling was mighty tasty , but i did not care for the stabilized whipped cream on top . <sssss> it did n't taste as fresh as it should have . <sssss> the pie slices are massive , so our sweet gamer-boy waiter brought it to us already cut in half . <sssss> we might be back , maybe some night when neither of us wants to cook and we 're tired of the usual suspects .
?		seriously , people . <sssss> mbfgr is `` mediterranean '' food capitalizing on a hokey movie that for some reason some people liked . <sssss> there 's a lot better to be had out there - try pita jungle , flaming kabob , or byblos , for examples . <sssss> i have also eaten once at the mill avenue location and both places have been a testament to mediocrity-and that 's being complimentary . <sssss> every server i have had here has been ... well , let 's just say `` special '' - or maybe stoned . <sssss> the food served and what the menu describes are seldom the same . <sssss> please , i beg you , avoid this chain and get some real food at a local establishment crafted and served by people who know where greece is .
?		hubby and i had dinner here recently before the symphony . <sssss> although the restaurant was not very busy , it took a while for us even to get drinks . <sssss> the waitress was nice when she finally showed up , answered questions about the menu , but then never bothered to refill our drinks for the rest of our time there . <sssss> hubby got the french onion soup , which seems to be one of their most popular items given the number of times i saw it go by on trays . <sssss> it was indeed tasty , topped with a smooth and mild swiss cheese . <sssss> he got the prime-rib french dip sandwich , which was way over-done in comparison to our favorite at houston 's , but still tender . <sssss> we wondered if it is prepared in the same way as their signature rock-salt prime-rib . <sssss> it came with a large side of white cheddar mac and cheese which was kind of bland . <sssss> i had a skewer of seafood - 2 shrimp -lrb- yummy -rrb- , 2 scallops -lrb- 1 was really gritty and both were slightly underdone -rrb- , and two 2 '' square pieces of well-cooked salmon on a bed of orzo and some veggies . <sssss> the atmosphere was pretty stuffy and the median age of the other patrons was probably early 60 's . <sssss> overall , we had average to mediocre food , mediocre service , and paid too much - $ 75 with 2 glasses of beer . <sssss> meh . <sssss> no reason for us to return .
?		we 've never been to this location , and overall , it was fine . <sssss> they were busy at 11:00 on a sunday , but we got seated within 10 minutes , just as they had predicted . <sssss> service was fine , but not stellar . <sssss> the coffee was a tad harsh , and i had to ask for water . <sssss> our breakfasts were ok : i had the trifecta , the idea of which i wish i would see more often on menus . <sssss> it was a belgian waffle , 2 eggs , and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage . <sssss> my bacon was pretty over-done , and my over-easy eggs were slightly under-done . <sssss> think of me what you will for the next comment , but the cooks at cracker barrel * always * get the eggs and bacon right . <sssss> the waffle was neither the best nor the worst i have ever had . <sssss> hubby had the bacon and avocado omelette , which he liked well enough . <sssss> he was glad for the salsa , which he said made the dull potatoes more palatable . <sssss> i do n't think we 'd ever make this first watch a destination breakfast , but if we find ourselves hungry at the promenade again , we might give it another chance .
?		in my constant search for newer , faster , and more interesting routes on my commute to work from cenpho to tempe , i 've been passing by rosita 's a lot recently , and coerced my husband , who came home the other night and said , `` carolina 's ? '' <sssss> to try rosita 's instead . <sssss> boy , was i sorry . <sssss> let 's start with the mariachi musicians who stood so closely behind me that they completely invaded my `` stranger bubble '' and i was forced to move my seat at the table . <sssss> next , there were the chips which were just ok to begin with , and ended with gobs of congealed grease after they had cooled a tad . <sssss> then , hubby 's machaca chimi was fine , with decent flavor , but my pork carnitas was so dry it was literally inedible . <sssss> you could look at it and see that the sliced pork was so dry it was like the dessicated flesh at the body worlds exhibit . <sssss> gross , i know , but so was this meat . <sssss> it simply should not have been served by a conscientious restaurant . <sssss> next time , i wo n't contest it when hubby suggests carolina 's -lrb- who serves the best chimis and by far the best tortillas in town -rrb- .
?		my husband has been wanting to go here for awhile now . <sssss> he had frequented the houston store when he lived there , and i had made him throw out his ancient dregs of penzey 's taco seasoning when he moved in . <sssss> i expected penzey 's to be far more expensive than it is . <sssss> many items are less than you would pay for mccormick 's in the grocery stores . <sssss> they sell just about any spice , dried herb , and combo seasoning that you could think of , in a good variety of sizes . <sssss> they also have cocoa powder , 3 different vanilla strengths , almond , lemon , and orange extracts , whole vanilla beans , arrowroot , and cream of tartar for the bakers . <sssss> they have sample jars of everything , so you can get a close look at the texture and get a good whiff as well . <sssss> it 's all very high quality . <sssss> they have recipe books , customizable gift packs , and very helpful staff . <sssss> if you are a food network junkie like we are , this is where you can get all the `` new '' hot seasonings all the cool kids are using .
?		louisiana born hubby decided he wanted to go to pappadeaux 's for his birthday dinner after we discovered that barrio cafe would be closed monday . <sssss> the restaurant was unbelievably packed for a random monday , but i was a tad annoyed that we still had to wait about a half hour to be seated - and that was with a reservation . <sssss> our waitress was great and got hubby 's requisite oyster , crawfish , and mushroom `` fondeaux '' started right away . <sssss> that kind of chain-y cutesy naming cheesiness makes me roll my eyes , but hubby is blind to such lameness since pappa 's has a whole empire of similarly named restaurants in texas -lrb- from where he moved to arcosanti whence i snagged him - but i digress -rrb- . <sssss> he also ordered some kind of layered frozen fruity monstrosity that made him positively loopy -lrb- in his defense , we 're not big drinkers -rrb- . <sssss> after the fondeaux appetizer , we barely had room for our entrees , so we both have excellent lunches today . <sssss> i had a mixed seafood grill which had very nicely cooked pieces of scallop , mahi , and salmon together with way too well done shrimp . <sssss> in apparently some sort of fugue state i also ordered a side of onion rings which i promptly regretted when the platter came out bigger than my head . <sssss> they were mighty tasty , though , and i have not had much luck before finding really good onion rings -lrb- except at ted 's hot dogs , of course -rrb- . <sssss> hubby ordered a crawfish platter with fried pieces and etoufee , but the waitress convinced him to get the triple slam with blackened crawfish as well - and this turned out to be his favorite on the plate . <sssss> all the portions are gargantuan , so we have to remember next time to share an entree , especially if we need to get the fondeaux . <sssss> which i 'm sure we will ...
?		tonight , i cheated on eliana 's with guanaquito . <sssss> i still feel a bit guilty , as i 've been with eliana 's for years , but when guanaquito does it better in almost every way , how can you fault me ? <sssss> if you blink , you 'll miss it - on mcdowell , between the gourmet house of hong kong and arizona endoscopy services . <sssss> you need to park in back , accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for guanaquito . <sssss> like eliana 's , it 's salvadoran cuisine , but there are so many more options at guanaquito . <sssss> they serve breakfast , lunch , and dinner , and based on tonight 's sampling , hubby and i will be back often to work our way through the menu . <sssss> i had the ensalada drink and hubby had the horchata , which the waitress patiently explained was different from mexican horchata . <sssss> it sure was - maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique . <sssss> for his entree , hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter - a tamale -lrb- again , quite different from a mexican tamale - softer and creamier -rrb- , 2 pastales -lrb- meat pies -rrb- and 2 pupusas -lrb- stuffed , grilled tortillas -rrb- . <sssss> guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than elaina 's , and they were every bit as good . <sssss> the one that i had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant -lrb- which to me had an asparagus-y taste -rrb- . <sssss> definitely delicious . <sssss> at both salvadoran places , we were served a bowl of cabbage salad , but at eliana 's we had never been told how to eat it . <sssss> guanaquito 's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas . <sssss> i was skeptical at first , but became quickly hooked . <sssss> it did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas , and added a nice crunch and zing . <sssss> the only thing i found that eliana 's did better than guanaquito was the flan . <sssss> guanaquito 's texture was off , but the flavor was acceptable . <sssss> i suppose i 'm willing to share my new love with all of you - but be forewarned - she 's a saucy mistress you 'll be compelled to visit again and again . <sssss> oh - and she 's cheap , too . <sssss> hubby and i got out of there for $ 24 -lrb- and that includes the extras i got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow ! <sssss> -rrb- .
?		i love this super target so much i am compelled to say its name in a sing-songy way . <sssss> suuuuuper taaaar-get ! <sssss> understand that this is not normal behavior for me . <sssss> i love this super target so much that i endured the light rail construction . <sssss> thank heaven it 's pretty much done now . <sssss> the christown chaos pisses hubby off so much he almost never goes with me . <sssss> but that 's ok - more time for me to poke around . <sssss> i love the awesome pet department . <sssss> they even have the new styles of scratchers and corrugated chaise lounges as well as kitty clothes . <sssss> now if only i could get my monsters to wear the lobster hat ... i love the grocery store part . <sssss> there are food items here i have n't seen outside of aj 's , and for a much more reasonable price ! <sssss> their archer farms store brand is better than expected . <sssss> their fair trade coffee pods -lrb- for use in our senseo machine -rrb- is simply the best coffee i have ever had . <sssss> i love that this store is so new and clean and well-organized . <sssss> they even have people patrolling the parking lot in segways . <sssss> suck it , walmart .
?		the best chicken fajita quesadilla in town !!! <sssss> love this place !
?		great wine , great ambiance , amazing music !
?		mouth-watering goodness !!! <sssss> glad i stumbled upon this place while working : -rrb- i may just have to drive out here to have the `` goat '' burger again ...
?		our first experience here was fairly well , -lrb- except peppercorn steak was way overloaded with peppercorn , we 're talkin ' 1/2 '' thick of spice around the entire piece of meat . <sssss> if you 're into that kind of thing , i did n't like biting into 90 % spice ande 10 % meat . <sssss> but it gets better as you work into it . <sssss> . <sssss> the second time we went left me saying , `` what happened ? <sssss> . <sssss> . '' <sssss> when we first came in , they said the wait was going to be 5-10 min . <sssss> , we waited 20 min . <sssss> i just figured the food was so good that people had to be forced to leave . <sssss> wrong . <sssss> when we sat , the waiter got us waters and took our orders -lrb- lobster bisque dip for appetizer , medium well prime rib 16 oz . <sssss> with baked potato and salmon salad-with no tomatos for entrees -rrb- , but did n't give us any bread at all -lrb- which we saw on every single table -rrb- . <sssss> i swear we sat there for 25 min . <sssss> sipping water before we got anything . <sssss> i was getting more and more annoyed as we watched everybody around us receive food . <sssss> apparently , some other waiter had stolen our waiter 's lobster appetizer . <sssss> why did n't our waiter just tell us that instead of the runner girl ? <sssss> the runner apologized , and i was like okay ... but then she left and we only had one appetizer plate to share this thing . <sssss> urg . <sssss> lobster dip did not have enough lobster bits in in , more queso than anything . <sssss> as the entrees arrived , they looked great . <sssss> as i chewed off some meat , it was getting more rare and i dug deeper , more bloody and the taste just overwhelmed me . <sssss> i could n't continue . <sssss> i do n't like being the ass that asks for a ` redo ' , but there was no way i was going to eat this obviously medium-medium rare steak . <sssss> hubs got tons of tomato in his salad which he requested not to have . <sssss> i sent my steak back and the hubs complained about the tomatos and salmon that was a bit rare . <sssss> the manager was nice enough to give us $ 20 in gift cards to apologize for the mishaps we 've had throughout the night , i just wish the waiter would have done more to make sure we were happy .
?		very fresh , young , trendy vibe here . <sssss> indoor and outdoor dining experience seem to blend together fairly well , along with all the decor and lighting . <sssss> i absolutely loved the hapu fish -lrb- lemon encrusted style -rrb- dish , extremely light and buttery fish , with a nice crunch to the skin . <sssss> great saucy flavor , a slight tang of pineapple and lemon , but nothing too strong . <sssss> it had a nice side of cole slaw and rice . <sssss> the one eyed pyrt was my drink -lrb- $ 5 happy hour ! <sssss> -rrb- , and it was a good rum drink , which it had more alcohol though , kinda felt like i was just drinking fruit punch after a while . <sssss> kris liked the jamaican jerk , but it was more like a curry styled dish , slightly spicer and style than he had envisioned . <sssss> i guess i 'm glad i picked a fish dish and not his dish since his stomach was trying to handle the curry hours later . <sssss> sadly , i was still hungry after my meal -lrb- $ 44 for the both of us -rrb- , and was hoping for a little more food ... but the actual quality and taste of the food is 5 stars , just falls 1 star short because of quantity . <sssss> : /
?		i feel in love with this little place ! <sssss> good variety of menu food -lrb- calamari , chicken , poppers , etc. -rrb- and drinks -lrb- snow , slush , milk tea -rrb- . <sssss> +1 minimum of $ 5 if you use a credit card . <sssss> -1 boba balls come in flavors as well +1 there is usually parking , and it 's right next to an awesome asian market +1 internet access -lrb- i 'm not sure if it 's just for customers or not . <sssss> . <sssss> yet -rrb- +1 clean and good working furniture , employees that are bilingual -lrb- not that i need that , but it 's nice to have -rrb- +1 = 4 stars will be back more often , you can count on it !
?		i came here a few times already and i can already say that my fav dishes here is the vietnamese spring rolls and well-done beef pho . <sssss> . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and it seems like a very clean restaurant . <sssss> only complaint is that the spring rolls are kinda small , but that 's it . <sssss> a bowl of pho ranges around $ 7-8 , so price is pretty average . <sssss> but as far an quantity , you will get plenty of beef , there 's no skimping of meat in that area . <sssss> the broth used is flavorful and has great aroma . <sssss> the owners seem like they really pride themselves in their food and service , and that to me is a good sign that they are always front and center of what 's going on.i like how it 's in the middle of the mekong plaza , so i can get a bunch of shopping and lunch in while i 'm in the area . <sssss> good stuff !
?		really pulled a douche bag move by coming here at 9:45 pm when they close at 10:00 , but everything was closed except for fast food places , in which we did n't feel in the mood for . <sssss> the hostess did n't give us any attitude and sat us ... it was super dark , but had comfy booths . <sssss> andy was our waiter and he had such a great attitude , we apologized for coming in so late , but he assured us that we were fine . <sssss> the salad was good , but kind of small , the buttery croissant that accompanied it , however is tasty . <sssss> hubs got porkchops and i got the chicken soup . <sssss> not bad , we ended up talking and laughing with andy about the restaurant industry ... too bad the bar was closed , i wanted to see if he wanted to drink with us .
?		my co-workers brought this in the building and said that i could try some of their fish tacos . <sssss> . <sssss> biting into the food felt like i needed to be sitting on beach somewhere with the warm sun over me and a margarita in the other hand . <sssss> so delicious and the flavors mixed together so well . <sssss> . <sssss> it was n't deep fried fish as i typically think of when i think of ` fish tacos ' . <sssss> grilled fish , mango , tomatoes , cilantro with sauce . <sssss> absolutely fresh . <sssss> the fries were pretty typical and salty . <sssss> this is a must-stop whenever i 'm in the scottsdale area again .
?		i like how this movie theater is in the middle of everything , shops big and small . <sssss> we came and saw gran turino , had a blast , it 's been a while since i 've said , `` the movie was worth the price of the ticket '' . <sssss> lol . <sssss> very clean and lots of new movies to choose from . <sssss> i was a bit bummed to pay $ 12 for a soda and popcorn though . <sssss> .
?		another recommendation by a fellow co-worker of mine ! <sssss> 1 . <sssss> they need to wipe down tables and clean up messes in the restaraunt more often , because of the volume of people coming in and out , it 's pretty gross to not be able to find a clean place to sit down and eat . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> fyi : they only accept credit cards for purchases of $ 5.00 or more . <sssss> weak . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> their carne asada plate -lrb- # 21 -rrb- only comes with one , yup , uno flour torilla for the entire place . <sssss> what ?! <sssss> : / good portions of food , it came with rice and beans . <sssss> b +
?		nothing beats their 1/2 lb . <sssss> meat and 2 sides -lrb- my choice was chicken & turkey plus cole slaw and garden salad -rrb- . <sssss> home-made rootbeer ... mmm hmmm !!
?		generally i 'm a huge gyro person , but i guess i do n't know my greek food well enough . <sssss> we tried the flaming feta -lrb- nice fire/cheese display-it 's an appetizer-crazy i know -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm not a kefalograviera -lrb- greek cheese -rrb- fan , but if you are , you 'd like it . <sssss> their portions were pretty big , the chicken souviald plate had sssooo much food on it , i wondered if we were ripping them off . <sssss> plenty of meat , potatos and vegetables . <sssss> i barely put a dent in it since it was a lot of food , it was $ 12.95 . <sssss> their drink cups are huge . <sssss> i have no idea why , but it reminded me of those monsterous cups-big gulps , that 's right . <sssss> not bad . <sssss> waitress was pretty hot too , lol . <sssss> very nice , she made the suggestions for the food , it was great food , i 'd like to go back !
?		i 'm probably the last person that should be reviewing any pizza place here in az ... i 'm from chicago , so i know what good pizza is . <sssss> is it the best i 've ever had ? <sssss> far from it . <sssss> is this the best that i 've had since i 've been here ? <sssss> yes . <sssss> maybe someday i 'll find that delicious pizza that i miss so much .
?		i 'm greek , so i was n't so sure about a greek chain ... until i had the greek fries . <sssss> if loving them is wrong , i do n't want to be right . <sssss> the greek salad and avgolemono soup are also very good ! <sssss> great staff and i have n't been there yet where it 's been overly crowded . <sssss> overall , it 's good food at good prices . <sssss> opa !
?		my husband and i ate lunch here a couple of weeks ago ... i literally think about the chicken fried steak everyday . <sssss> first of all , it 's huge ... we 're talking hanging off the plate huge . <sssss> second of all , the mashed and gravy -- ` nuff said ! <sssss> third of all , the pecan pie . <sssss> my husband ordered it -lrb- as much as i wanted to try the peach cobbler , i felt like violet beauregarde from willy wonka when she ate the gum -rrb- ... i took one bite -lrb- delicious , i might add -rrb- , and he literally knocked the spoon out of my hand . <sssss> i thought he was going to lick the plate clean . <sssss> anyone that gave this place bad reviews obviously is missing some taste buds , and probably thinks the food at tgifridays is good ... i would n't take their reviews seriously . <sssss> i love this place ... not only is the food delicious , but it has a great atmosphere ! <sssss> old hats , brochures , business cards , license plates , etc. decorate the place . <sssss> great food , great atmosphere !
?		went here for the first time this past saturday . <sssss> i was craving a ruben - random i know . <sssss> but it really hit the spot -lrb- although a little much on the slaw -rrb- . <sssss> just $ 6 for a big sandwich -lrb- i was full well into the evening -rrb- and a surprise cookie ! <sssss> i will definitely be back to try out some of the other choices or create my own . <sssss> oh , and if you have the same initials they put on the chalkboard that day - you get a free sandwich ! <sssss> my lunch date had the opposite of what was posted -lrb- d.s. instead of s.d -rrb- and the cashier gave us both free drinks . <sssss> super cool .
?		i 've only been here once , but loved it ! <sssss> it definitely has the urban vibe . <sssss> i had a hamburger with the hula sauce on the side - delish ! <sssss> it was cooked perfectly with great flavor and served on yummy bun . <sssss> wish i could have eaten the whole thing , but it came with amazing sweet potato fries and i filled up on those . <sssss> probably the best i 've ever had ! <sssss> seems like a great place for happy hour so i 'll definitely be coming back for that .
?		i 've always enjoyed oregano 's . <sssss> who does n't like their pizza and pasta dishes or their pazooki -lrb- i always share the half and half -rrb- ?! <sssss> but recently , i found my favorite dish ever and will order it every time i go . <sssss> after i realized how much i enjoyed it , i found out it 's the healthiest thing on the menu ! <sssss> or at least that 's what someone told me . <sssss> either way - the big beefstro salad is what i will be ordering from now on . <sssss> it 's filled with shaved rib-eye , jalapenos , sweet onions and a sweet serrano dressing atop the greens . <sssss> oh , and sometimes i like to indulge in the dirty monkey - it 's delicious , but strong .
?		i was really looking forward to trying their sliders , but they 're just ok - nothing special . <sssss> however , i will come back again and again for their banana milkshake . <sssss> it 's made with real vanilla ice cream and chunks of banana blended in . <sssss> i 'm not even a big fan of banana things , and i love this . <sssss> it 's a casual place , where you order at the counter and then can dine in or get take out . <sssss> i hope to try more things here and find something i like more than their hamburgers .
?		love this place . <sssss> we recently stopped by for breakfast and will definitely be returning . <sssss> we got their poached eggs and they were delish . <sssss> but everything looked good so i ca n't wait to try some of their other offerings . <sssss> it 's such a charming little place and they have a cute outdoor patio for when it gets a little warmer . <sssss> also love how friendly the staff is . <sssss> we will be returning soon !
?		i love love love switch . <sssss> i was there two weeks ago for the first time , on a saturday night after a concert . <sssss> my room mate and i were looking for great food and drink specials around 8:00 pm . <sssss> . <sssss> i reached out to yelp and was introduced to switch ! <sssss> the $ 3.00 martinis -lrb- cosmo , lime or blueberry -rrb- are the stiffest and tastiest drinks i have ever had , outside of me making them at home . <sssss> the blueberry martini is my favorite and it comes with delicious fresh blueberries floating in the bottom of the glass . <sssss> the food is delectable , which is why i decided to have my second event for my group : east coast foodies on the west : az edition yesterday . <sssss> i loved the clams , which came out in a cast iron skillet smothered in a yummy garlic and herb base with tomatoes , corn , and other vegetables with a side of yummy warm crusty bread . <sssss> i am also a sucker for the moist grilled and marinated chicken breast that is only $ 3.95 for a nice helping and creamy sun dried tomato risotto croquettes ! <sssss> the ambiance is sexy , chic , and trendy ; it reminds me of a lot of bars/restaurants on the east coast where i am from . <sssss> i truly felt at home , relaxed , and full . <sssss> i will be back , soon !
?		wow , my roomate took me here when i first moved to arizona several months ago . <sssss> i was impressed ! <sssss> the food was awesome , the decor really cute , and they have a cute bar that serves alcoholic beverages . <sssss> i loved my eggs benedict and would love to return here again sometime soon ! <sssss> cheers
?		i am in love with this place . <sssss> i finally visited on a lazy , hot , and beautiful sunday . <sssss> i enjoyed the misters and breezes as i sat at the outside bar . <sssss> the bartender silk was amazing , attentive , and can make a delicious drink . <sssss> the coronado drink which is a combination of cherry bourbon , elder flower , agave , and one other ingredient that i forgot , rocked my world . <sssss> this was during happy hour and this delectable drink was only $ 5.00 . <sssss> i tried the goat cheese and bread , and fell in love with this dish after every bite . <sssss> overall , this is a sexy , chic , and fun place to people watch , eat yummy food , and drink strong drinks !!! <sssss> cheers
?		avoid this store and go to the chandler mall store if you care about quality service . <sssss> the sales clerks at this store stand around and chat with each other rather than asking if you need help . <sssss> we were planning on purchasing two macbook airs and 3 sales clerks were chatting with one another at the display table next to us . <sssss> they were not working but showing each other pictures on their phones . <sssss> the store was not busy . <sssss> when we finally got a clerk to help us , she acted as if she was too busy to offer any service . <sssss> there was a sense of entitlement in the clerks and they did n't feel like it was their job to offer you service . <sssss> we got the hint and rather than waste our time begging for service , we went to the apple store in the chandler mall . <sssss> just as we predicted , someone approached us and asked if we needed help . <sssss> the clerk spent more than enough time with us and we bought our macbooks from him . <sssss> the chandler store was busier than this store yet that did n't stop them from providing great service . <sssss> this is not the first time i 've experienced bad service at this particular location . <sssss> i prefer to purchase apple products from the chandler store but we were waiting to see a movie at the ipic and had some time to burn . <sssss> sure enough , the predictably lousy service was there and we decided to walk out and buy our macbooks at the chandler store . <sssss> i 'm curious if a manager is even present to observe their employees standing around and chatting with each other .
?		i usually write long reviews but i 'm going to keep it simple . <sssss> do n't believe the hype . <sssss> this is nothing more than fast food mexican . <sssss> if you have been carambas , it 's exactly the same tihng except it has more hype and there is more seating . <sssss> otherwise , the setting , format and style of mexican food is exactly the same . <sssss> carolinas is good but i heard amazing things about this place ... along the lines of best mexican in phoenix and nothing could be further from the truth . <sssss> again , it was good food but if someone served you this food and made no mention of carolina 's , you would n't be able to distinguish this food from several dozen mexican style pseudo fast food eateries . <sssss> the salsa is also overrated . <sssss> there is nothing special about it . <sssss> imagine if you took pico de gallo and regular runny salsa and combined the two . <sssss> that all this salsa is . <sssss> it 's as if they poured the two into a vat and just mixed it . <sssss> sure , if you live near this place or your work place is near it , you should certainly check it out . <sssss> you will enjoy it but you will not be mesmerized by it . <sssss> i would definitely not go out of my way to eat there or take people there . <sssss> in short : highly disappointed but still enjoyed the food .
?		okay bbq for arizona , mediocre for everywhere else it 's receiving 4 stars due the dearth of bbq joints in the phoenix metro and people are so desperate for bbq that this place gets rave reviews . <sssss> honestly , i think honey bears is far better . <sssss> there are several flaws with this place . <sssss> the pulled pork comes with no bbq sauce ; yes it 's served dry and mushy and you have to apply your own . <sssss> i 've never been to a bbq place where the pulled pork is not served in sauce . <sssss> the ribs are tiny and the meat does not fall off the bone ; the meat is actually quite tough . <sssss> for pork ribs , the meat is supposed to fall of the bone and be tender and succulent . <sssss> the baked beans had no flavor . <sssss> there is no chicken on the menu , only turkey . <sssss> the sauce itself is underwhelming . <sssss> they seem to be preoccupied with the idea that `` heat '' or spiciness makes for a better sauce . <sssss> and that could n't be further from the truth . <sssss> we are talking about bbq sauce not salsa . <sssss> the best sauces have flavor not heat . <sssss> their `` sissy '' sauce was actually their better sauce . <sssss> their `` original sauce '' has too much crushed red pepper and almost has salsa like undertones . <sssss> finally , the fact that you do n't get a container of sauce when you order take-out is bush league . <sssss> they have these tiny packets of sauce that resemble tiny packets of butter or margarine at a diner . <sssss> any respectable bbq establishments gives you a container of sauce to go with your food . <sssss> and unfortunately , you need more than a container since their food is pretty dry and devoid of sauce . <sssss> sorry but phoenix deserves better .
?		the novelty of the place does impact it but it should n't be discounted . <sssss> phoenix does n't have a lot of unique mom and pop restaurants so when you find one like lo-lo 's that offers soul food in the valley , you should definitely check it out . <sssss> the food itself was excellent . <sssss> i 've been to gus ' fried chicken in memphis and the chicken here is just as good . <sssss> the side dishes is what prevented this place from hitting 5 stars . <sssss> while they were good , they were nothing special . <sssss> i will come back here again . <sssss> one more thing , this place is safe . <sssss> we went here on a saturday night assuming the place would be full of questionable characters because the restaurant 's location is n't in the best part of the city -lrb- buckeye and central -rrb- and at night on a saturday , we were a little worried about safety . <sssss> however , everything was fine . <sssss> the diners were all classy with a great mixed crowd of african americans and whites and even the staff is mixed . <sssss> it was rather `` preppy '' believe it or not . <sssss> we will definitely come back .
?		in most cites , the w hotel is a place of well educated and chill people who are looking to have great conversation and relax ... aka business travelers , physicians etc. . <sssss> scottsdale ruined the w concept and it is trying to be an upscale club much like the sanctuary tried to do back in 2000 . <sssss> that 's not the vibe people expect from the w . <sssss> the staff at the w are mixed . <sssss> some of the bouncers are gentlemen and professionals who appreciate educated people while the others are trashy meatheads who act elitist for no reason . <sssss> it 's hit or miss and you could have a very bad experience if you run into the wrong bouncer . <sssss> one of the bouncers lied to us and told us our contact/manager at the w did n't exist . <sssss> when we called our contact to meet us downstairs , he escorted us upstairs , bought us drinks and reprimanded that dumb 20 yo bouncer who was trying to act above his pay grade . <sssss> nonetheless , juvenile tactics like that should be held at martini ranch not the w . <sssss> this is supposed to be a classy place . <sssss> on a positive note , the waitresses upstairs are very nice and not fake . <sssss> they are beautiful but friendly and did n't have unnecessary attitude .
?		we came here for restaurant week back in may . <sssss> first they were very gracious and accommodating , because i messed up big time . <sssss> we showed up on saturday and i had made the reservations for the day before : -lrb- we were a group of 4 and ended up sitting at the bar , but it was nice and quiet . <sssss> food was good as always and the only glitch i remember is that the desert hubby ordered was tiny , and was a lot of chocolate , which was not in the name or description i think because he does not like chocolate . <sssss> i think it was the cheesecake , not sure . <sssss> everyone was very friendly .
?		ooops , i 've been kind of sick and we did n't feel like cooking , we also had to go pick up a prescription at costco so we stopped by the food court . <sssss> : -rrb- oh man , we had dinner for 2 for about $ 7 hubby had the new pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and i had the polish . <sssss> he thought it did n't have enough bbq sauce , but it was still very good . <sssss> i tasted the coleslaw and i liked it . <sssss> so affordable , drinks are only $ 0.59 we have a great respect for this company and their business model . <sssss> way to go costco !
?		we came back for lunch , to treat our admin to lunch for admin professional 's day . <sssss> we all had pho , she had chicken and me and my friend had the saigon pho i think , which is the one with beef , tripe and tendons ... it was really good . <sssss> the only thing is that when ordering i told our server i was doing low carb , and asked what options were there regarding the noodles , and she said i could order ` half noodles ' ... which i did but it still was a huge ball of noodles . <sssss> when she picked up my place she noticed i left almost all , and she said i could have ordered no noodles and they add other vegetables instead , such as cauliflower and some other stuff ... : / so , if you are doing low carb , make sure to mention no noodles , vegetables instead . <sssss> the bowl is really big and the soup is tasty . <sssss> and they bring also a plate with sprouts , jalapeño , lemon/lime , and thai basil . <sssss> i added a little bit of everything to my bowl and it was really good . <sssss> definitely coming back . <sssss> oh , about drinks , i did stick with water , but the rest of my party had the vietnamese iced coffee ... oh man ... it is delicious . <sssss> anyway , i behaved really well and only had the low carb stuff : -rrb-
?		what ? <sssss> i never reviewed baby kay 's ? <sssss> unbelievable ! <sssss> well , there is not much i can say because every time we go there we end up ordering the same thing ! <sssss> haha ... and that is the cajun combination : chicken gumbo , crawfish etouffee , chicken , and sausage jambalaya , cup of each . <sssss> it comes with a side , i always get the cole slaw -lrb- which i love , it has green olives -rrb- and hubby always gets the potato salad , which he also loves . <sssss> i just checked their site and it says they are hoping to reopen on 2/2014 on the new location . <sssss> counting the days !
?		stopped here for late dinner after movie -lrb- 9pm on a tuesday -rrb- they were not busy and we were seated promptly . <sssss> danny was our server , we had water and diet coke . <sssss> we had the bread to start -lrb- nothing to write home about -rrb- hummus appetizer was good , and the wheat honey pita was outstanding . <sssss> i think they bake their pitas , they were very hot . <sssss> we shared a sicilian pizza . <sssss> i am glad we decided to share as we even had half left over . <sssss> the pizza was very good . <sssss> , thin and crispy as the name says . <sssss> i would probably ask for more sauce if we order it again , but it was still very good . <sssss> it looked exactly like the picture in the online menu , but maybe even better as it had thin slices of cheese on top -lrb- the pic shows some cheese , but ours had more -rrb- . <sssss> i think this is the first time i have the honor to say the real one looked better than the picture . <sssss> it is usually the opposite : -rrb- we chose this place because of the american express synch credit , and we will definitely be back .
?		beers ! <sssss> good ones ! <sssss> on tap ! <sssss> lots of them ! <sssss> boobies ! <sssss> fake ones ! <sssss> on the servers ! <sssss> most of them ! <sssss> -lrb- oh yeah , and music and comedy and food and stuff too -rrb-
?		holy cow . <sssss> i could be a hindu if only the method of worshipping was eating the object of worship . <sssss> -lrb- which i guess makes my true natural religion vulvan , but that 's another story -rrb- ` ,8 ^ -rcb- the half priced , half kobe , half chuck , happy hour daily dose burger was wholly delicious . <sssss> the pretzel-bread bun just took it over the top . <sssss> the rest of the menu looked thoughtfully prepared , and a brief conversation with one of the principals confirmed the serious attitude with which they take their establishment . <sssss> the staff handling our patio party was to be heartily commended . <sssss> the server was actually remembering and calling most everyone at the table by their first name ! <sssss> the empty plates and beer bottles never lingered long , and the cucumber slice infused -lrb- i 'll never enjoy lemon-water quite as much again , this stuff was so refreshing ! <sssss> -rrb- water glasses were never empty . <sssss> perhaps the wonderful company of multiple yelpers and the genuine conversation had me in a bit of an in-clover stupor , but i left daily dose with a feeling of fulfillment that went far beyond my belly . <sssss> special thanks donald for the set-up , and carin 's parents for being so hip and cool !
?		brought my family in for dinner on a saturday , and we were literally treated like guests in their home . <sssss> this great , family-run , independant , unique eatery is just what everyone hopes for in their neigborhood . <sssss> if you 're not in the neigborhood , do n't worry , you 'll be welcomed whole-heartedly . <sssss> drive past as many local fast food gyro joints as you need to on the way , and you 'll be glad you did .
?		this new place is not your average fast-food chicago/greek style gyro joint , at all . <sssss> it 's so much better ... this is a fast casual semi-fine dining version of one of those restaurants . <sssss> the place is an oasis of clean and cozy considering the strip mall location . <sssss> they offer several authentic and freshly prepared choices for lunch and dinner , and use beautiful pictures of the dishes as part of the menu . <sssss> this not only helps a person less familiar with the food to select an item , but also ensures that you see several dishes that look splenderific , causing you to plan your next visit before you 've even finished ordering today 's meal ! <sssss> i 've had their delicious gyro and falafel sandwiches for lunch , but also the unexpectedly exciting marinated chicken breast sandwich , and sampled a few other dishes . <sssss> every time daren c and i have been in for lunch , they 've offered a bowl of soup as an appetizer -- several flavors have all been tasty . <sssss> the food is really good , 4 - 4.5 stars . <sssss> the service is what really takes this place over the top into solid 5 star rating territory . <sssss> the husband and wife team running the show are friendly and will chat with all the new customers and ` new regulars ' -lrb- the place is n't that old , but there are regulars already -rrb- . <sssss> watch for the little boy , though -- maybe 4 or 5 years old . <sssss> this little charmer who hangs out in the dining area is not only super polite , but he is likely to give you a shy `` are you enjoying your soup ? '' <sssss> , with no prompting from either parent . <sssss> while daren and i ate last week , we heard his dad telll the story of how this little guy suggested they get one of those sign spinners , since it would be a good way to tell people about their new restaurant . <sssss> that little dude will be running this place someday . <sssss> it 's certainly good enough to stay in busniess long enough .
?		mutt-friendly microbrews - oh yea . <sssss> hiking with jaek recently one evening was culminated wonderfully with a tasty ale on their shaded patio . <sssss> sure it was warm , but we were together - a boy and his dog and his beer . <sssss> beautiful , man , beautiful .
?		make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you 're a homophobic 7th grade boy , but dick 's hideaway has really got a great menu of american food . <sssss> might not be a burger , fry , and shake diner , but new mexican cuisine is american all the way , and as a matter of fact , among their many southwestern tinged dishes , they 've got a superb thick , juicy burger , grilled up on an open flame right in front of you as you sit at the bar , with some great fries and a nice full plate of dark green salad for somewhere around 11 bucks-ish -lrb- last i was aware -rrb- .
?		in short : awful food with no imagination , go at your own peril . <sssss> i was in downtown phoenix and it was pretty late so decided to drop by this place . <sssss> looked ok from the outside but i should have walked out as soon as i walked in . <sssss> the place was adorned by eclectic collection of 60 's , 70 's and 80 's lefotovers . <sssss> the atmosphere from the start was dead wrong . <sssss> hardly any of the staff spoke english , which made ordering an interesting adventure in it self . <sssss> the menu is also a collection of 60 's , 70 's and 80 's leftovers ans typical chinese dishes . <sssss> which in my opinion is ok if the food was any good , unfortunately that was not the case . <sssss> we ordered a soup , a appetizer , and two main dishes -lrb- kung pao chicken , and spicy beef -rrb- . <sssss> soup was decent but the appetizer was over cooked and soaked with oil , then plastered with a thick sauce to make up for it . <sssss> spicy beef was overcooked and unappetizing as well , i suspected the meat was a little old as well . <sssss> the real kicker was the cungpao chicken , my friend noticed a piece of rotten vegetable on our dish . <sssss> we brought this to the attention of our waitress who took the dish to show to another staff member and then came back and said there was nothing wrong with it and it was a water chestnut . <sssss> she took over 10 minues to explain this but for the life of me i could n't understand her . <sssss> they really did n't give us an option to replace the dish , get a new one or even refund the money . <sssss> i have no idea if it was a rotten or actually a chestnut but they could have at least offered us a compromise . <sssss> customer service was pretty much zero . <sssss> i eat a lot of chinese food and i was really disappointed with the oldest chinese restaurant in phoenix .
?		in short : average sushi , not much imagination , but the happy hour is awesome . <sssss> i probably would n't go here on a regular basis if the happy hour is n't so good . <sssss> the location is pretty nice as well , conveniently located around the heart of tempe , and pretty close to asu as well . <sssss> the interior is decorated `` asian '' style but it has some quirkiness to it as well . <sssss> there are two main areas to dine , one is by bar and the other is the main dining hall . <sssss> the staff is pretty nice too , mostly college kids . <sssss> it 's your average sushi place , you got various types of maki , then a decent collection of nagiri , but not a lot of variation in sashimi . <sssss> i find most of the maki to have too much rice , and it 's packed pretty hard , making it a bit too glutenous . <sssss> there are o specialty `` wow '' items on the menu , just the basics . <sssss> what makes this place decent is the happy hour . <sssss> not every item is in it but it 's pretty comprehensive . <sssss> most of the items are a few dollars off and some of them even half price . <sssss> five dollar saki bommers are the real star here . <sssss> i 'd recommend this place for happy hour but as for the sushi it is sub-par .
?		in short : great quality ingredients and they stay true to their products but pretty much everything is overpriced . <sssss> i like their food , good quality ingredients prepared in a way that brings out the best of them . <sssss> not much frills but the flavours are decent but not amazing . <sssss> i can really taste the quality and freshness of pretty much all their food . <sssss> they tend to be on the slow side on service , but probably because they make everything pretty fresh . <sssss> i 'd go here more often if it was n't for the price and if it were open for normal human hours . <sssss> lunch runs about 15 $ for a sandwich and the portions are just average . <sssss> i understand that they are catering for a niche market that expect to pay that much for this kind of product . <sssss> i like to eat healthy too but it 's just too much of a reach in my opinion .
?		excellent service and food with nice rooms did n't realize the westin kierland had so much going for it . <sssss> staying there , i was surprised how large the resort feels from the inside with the hotel , conference center , spa , restaurants , and golf course . <sssss> check in was a tad slow , but staff were very nice and asked questions to make sure the room would fit our family . <sssss> being across the street from kierland commons allowed my wife and little girls to have something to do while attended to work events . <sssss> my wife , a connoisseur of fine beds , thought the beds were somewhat hard . <sssss> i thought it was perfect . <sssss> the conference center is top notch in terms of a comfortable , classy setting with attentive services people taking care of you . <sssss> caught myself pausing to take in the beauty of the resort 's views a couple times . <sssss> one memorable things is the food . <sssss> the dinners were truly exceptional and the lamb shank is something i 'll remember for a while . <sssss> magnificent !
?		costco tire department leaves much to be desired ... my wife 's car needed new tires . <sssss> we like shopping in avondale and headed over to costco . <sssss> the guy who sold the tires was nice enough and seemed knowledgeable about tires . <sssss> installation was completed quickly . <sssss> that 's the good news . <sssss> the problem we had was that we received an ad later than day about the same tires being available for about $ 25 cheaper . <sssss> went back to the store expecting the great service you hear about from costco . <sssss> i did n't find it . <sssss> and i really tried . <sssss> the store staff relayed that costco does not price match . <sssss> they then offered take our new tires as a return with a refund minus the installation and disposal fee . <sssss> asking why they would keep the disposal fee , they said they would n't be able to find our original tires to put back on . <sssss> i questioned how i would be able to drive away if they did n't give our tires back , one technician said he did n't know . <sssss> not believing these to be intelligent answers , i spoke with a manager . <sssss> after talking it through , she shared that did n't make sense , but was all they could offer . <sssss> i 'm still not sure if that was supposed to make me feel better or worse . <sssss> i emailed costco customer services online and got no response after a week . <sssss> bottom line : not the best prices . <sssss> do n't stand behind their prices . <sssss> offers a frustrating customer service experience . <sssss> has service staff who are nice , but unable/unwilling to do much .
?		good food ; bad flies ; so-so service . <sssss> tried this place with my family after the june 2012 write-up in phoenix magazine . <sssss> the restaurant was a little odd to find and the mandatory valet was interesting , but the interior is amazing . <sssss> the person -lrb- s -rrb- who did the building and interior design did a superb job -- the spot is very open , the revealed kitchen is fun -lrb- especially for an interested 4 year-old -rrb- , and the artistic touches and lighting fit perfectly . <sssss> not often i take notice of these kinds of things , but this is an exceptional concept place that way . <sssss> we tried the chef 's board , burrata alla panna -lrb- asparagus -rrb- , mafaldine -lrb- rock shrimp and long noodles -rrb- , margherita pizza , and buttered noodles . <sssss> all were very good , though not remarkable . <sssss> bread is for-charge and the water has an `` interesting '' taste . <sssss> the most offending thing was the flies . <sssss> we 're talking lots of them . <sssss> and big ones . <sssss> and so persistent you might as well pull them up a chair and plate . <sssss> when your little kid asks why there are so many flies an why they have red stripes and such big eyes , something went awry . <sssss> a kid should not notice the exoskeletonal features of insects at a nice restaurant . <sssss> odd to constantly brush the flies away , just look around to see every other table doing the same . <sssss> it proved to b a sad , asynchronous dance for would-be happy diners . <sssss> we skipped dessert just to get away from the bothersome diptera . <sssss> if only the service staff was as attentive ! <sssss> waitress was middling at best . <sssss> drinks were left unfilled for long periods . <sssss> two plates came out too hot while the pizza was just warm -- our daughter 's dish came out so hot that she would have burnt her mouth had my wife not tested first -lrb- and singed her tongue -rrb- . <sssss> i also had to ask if there were specials because it was n't volunteered ... maybe specials are a private and fabulous secret , here . <sssss> i did n't order the special soup , so not sure if it was indeed nirvana . <sssss> would visit again if there was reason , but my wife and i agreed walking out that it would n't be worth a trip on its own .
?		chicago memories from a hot dog and big beef okay , that lead line sounds horrible , but it 's accurate . <sssss> my wife and i loved portillo 's when we lived in chicago . <sssss> cheap , good eats and an authentic chicago dog . <sssss> my father-in-law spent decades loving the italian beef sandwiches . <sssss> prices are very good for the amount of food . <sssss> truth is there is a lot of hype associated with portillo 's coming to the phoenix area from folks with chicago roots . <sssss> it 's a classic and old-time fave . <sssss> food is yummy and authentic , but nothing remarkable compared to your places with innovative chefs . <sssss> um , it 's also not considered health food . <sssss> -lrb- just fyi . <sssss> : o-rrb - -rrb- the drive thru process may also throw people the first time . <sssss> i had forgotten how unusual it is -- order with a person who walks your car to the cashier person who then send you up to the food deliverers . <sssss> regardless , i love that portillos and chicago hamburger co are here to fill the need for authentic chi-town fare .
?		fun shopping site for high-end stores kierland commons has some uncommon stores ad restaurants that we visit on occasion . <sssss> ipic is the best movie experience in town . <sssss> i 'm a fan of true foods and zinc bistro . <sssss> they have the best apple store in the region . <sssss> and the clothing stores are good for splurging . <sssss> mall layout is also nice when the weather is good . <sssss> during the summer , it 's a drag to be out there in the extreme heat . <sssss> and if you want to see a bunch of people with ferrari , maserati , porsche , and an occasional lambo , this is definitely your place .
?		unmitigated disaster - we will never be back again , and i would have to recommend -lrb- after this experience -rrb- for no one to go there either . <sssss> upon entering the restaurant , we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk . <sssss> our reservation was for 7pm , and we got there at 6:55 pm . <sssss> the disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it 's closer to 7pm ... since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance ? <sssss> moving forward , we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated . <sssss> a little unusual for a tuesday night , but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated . <sssss> i understand that restaurants can get busy , but a simple `` i 'm sorry for the wait '' would have gone a long way . <sssss> there were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room . <sssss> several tables were available , so i did n't understand the long wait . <sssss> anyway , there 's an old-fashioned quality to this place ... not good or bad . <sssss> the chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt , but we were there for the food . <sssss> we sampled the duck tamales . <sssss> unfortunately , there was nothing special about this dish . <sssss> it was n't great , but it was n't horrible either . <sssss> that was the highlight of the evening while waiting for the main dishes to arrive , it got extremely cold in the restaurant . <sssss> we hear the staff complaining about the temperature , and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room . <sssss> finally , dinner arrives ... i ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare . <sssss> it tasted medium-well to well done . <sssss> the waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions , but looking at the dish , there were thinly shaved bits of meat . <sssss> this dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids -lrb- which i hated , by the way -rrb- . <sssss> my wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave . <sssss> she tells me , `` for the price of this meal , i 'd rather eat a microwaveable meal . '' <sssss> i tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it could n't be that bad ... wrong . <sssss> the short ribs were chewy , stringy , and although it was covered in sauce , it was dry . <sssss> we hardly put a dent in our meal . <sssss> while waiting for our missing waiter , we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym . <sssss> we both started laughing at how horrible everything had been . <sssss> we were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check . <sssss> he never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full . <sssss> anyway , the moral of the story is : do n't waste your money here . <sssss> or perhaps call in advance to make sure vincent is working . <sssss> while waiting for our car , the valet guy said , `` vincent is on vacation . <sssss> his food is phenomenal , but when he 's not here , we hear customer complaints . '' <sssss> maybe this guy is right , and vincent 's food is out-of-this-world ; however , based on the service alone , i will not even bother coming back . <sssss> no second chances for this place - no thanks !
?		got the # 13 tom yum soup , which was salty to almost unedible , with shrimp cooked to within an inch of their life , pretty poor example of this type of soup the # 54 pad thai was done reasonably well , however the menu states chicken and shrimp , there certainly was no shrimp in this dish it was just chicken , - americanized but still tasty based on this trip i would probably not return
?		finally have a chance to get this post up , and i can not believe we do not have a thread on atlas bisto because of how amazing it was . <sssss> they had always been on `` the list '' of places to try , i wish we would have moved it to the top sooner . <sssss> it is located in a strip mall on scottsdale road toward tempe in a strip mall , as most of the good restaurants in the area are walking in it is a bit confusing as you go through az wine , which is a very large wine store , with a great selection of sake , wine , half bottles , craft beer -lrb- aventinus -rrb- so turn to your left and there you will see the dining area , if no one is immediatly there someone will pop up shortly as there are only two people working the front of the house . <sssss> it is byob so you can bring a wine if you would like to or get there a bit early and browse , or bring your own wine and during the meal add something extra if you run out of wine -lrb- which we did ! <sssss> -rrb- below is the menu choices that we had on offering first course smoked paprika braised pork shoulder , queso cotija , guacamole , shaved baby radishes korabuta pork belly , butternut squash hash , tamarind peach glaze hand rolled porcini gnocchi , maitakes , ginger cabbage , black bean miso cream second course grilled romaine , fried rainbow valley egg , spanish anchovies , capers , raisins roasted striped beets , gala apples , horseradish cream , prairie breeze amish cheddar applewood smoked duck breast , peaches , sweet corn , cranberries , almonds , arugula , frisee * add $ 5 third course grilled pork porterhouse , spaetzle , spaghetti squash , bacon brussel slaw , amish asian pear butter niman ranch tri-tip steak , roasted fingerlings , baby rainbow carrots , black mesa ranch feta , caper aioli wild caught market fish , white beans , cherry tomatoes , fennel , baby spinach , green goddess -lrb- swordfish -rrb- now on top of this there were a couple items on top of the normal menu , there were sweetbreads for the first course -lrb- +5 supp -rrb- and there was another option for the second course but i do not recall what it was course 1 - i had the sweetbreads which were had a sauce that was delicious -lrb- i can not remembe what kind , the good kind -rrb- with a plum apple slices to freshen it up for some acidity and they had a cornmealish fried texture to them -- i had been to blackbird -lrb- 1 star michelin chicago -rrb- who also served up a sweetbread 1st course , and this preperation blew it out of the water , and that was our favorite app we had there -- also they gave a very good portion size as well , this was not a restaurant week portion to make tons of money this was their normal portion just at a discounted price - one thing that always drove me crazy about rw is that many places do n't put their best foot forward and try to make a quick buck , instead of trying to gain return clients the mrs had the pork belly , which i have to say was one of the best pork belly 's i have had in a very very long time . <sssss> it seems they are always overcooked and stringy instead of melt in your mouth lucious . <sssss> the flavoring and cooking of it was perfect , again to releate it to blackbird -lrb- because two of the 1st course apps were the same ingredient -rrb- blackbird overcooked theirs and it we left some of it on the plate , i was lucky to get one bite of the pork belly from my wife our friends we went with , he ordered identical to me , and his wife went with the gnocchi , she really enjoyed it however i did not try any of it course 2 - i had the smoked duck salad , which was not exactly what i was expecting and i was pleasantly suprised . <sssss> for some reason i expected warm duck , but it was chilled duck with just a light touch of smoke , to set off the flavor against the tangy peaches and sweet corn , it was amazing and way better than what i had pictured in my head - there was also tons of duck in it , every bite huge piece of duck - just great the mrs had the grilled romaine with anchovies , which was also very good , nice anchovies on it and she really liked it , however the duck salad was where it was at - our friends wife went with the off menu salad and she really liked it , i passed on trying it because it wasnt beating the duck salad course 3 - 3 of us had the grilled pork porterhouse which was one of the best pork dishes that i have had , the only other one that i would rank up there when they had it on the menu was the stuffed pork chop at cowboy ciao -lrb- no longer on the menu -rrb- this was was equal to it or better , they cooked it pretty close to medium rare which is perfect for me and everything about it was good , lots of flavor - the mrs had the steak -lrb- when todd was explaining the menu he was very elaborate about everything on the menu and then he was like `` we have steak too '' -rrb- so that was really on the menu because you have to have a steak on the menu - it was n't bad but when all the other flavors on every other course is off the charts , just a good steak isnt the same - however as a good husband i gave multiple pieces of the pork porterhouse to mrs dapuma character limit
?		i was looking forward to another establishment this evening but due to some street fair i was unable to get in but it lead me to the parlor and i am sooo glad it did . <sssss> the vibe was perfect and very cool but quaint and friendly . <sssss> a great crowd on this night , the staff was very helpful and friendly and ther service was great . <sssss> the food was amazing as were the prices and the wine . <sssss> overall great experience . <sssss> the only thing , the parking lot is so tiny and hardly any available and only option was to valet and i 'm not a big fan of that .
?		i can not explain how much i love the food here , especially the fungi pizza . <sssss> to.die.for . <sssss> they have a great happy hour menu from 3-6 and all day sunday , which i appreciate . <sssss> the service is hit and miss . <sssss> if only they could be more consistent with the service , this place would knock it out of the park .
?		ok , this place is expensive . <sssss> like $ 50 bucks for 1 kid 2 adults and that 's just to walk in . <sssss> plus the planetarium and any extras . <sssss> on the other hand , it was a full day worth of fun and exploration . <sssss> totally worth it just make sure to bring the hand sanitizer .
?		the list of things that makes this place awesome can go on and on . <sssss> the service is top notch , you will never be in need of anything . <sssss> the food , beyond outstanding . <sssss> i love the filet mignon chopped salad . <sssss> this salad will move you , it is unlike any other . <sssss> i took a friend there the other day , boasting about this salad , and he was impressed . <sssss> yes , it 's a man friendly salad as well . <sssss> the ingredients are fresh and crispy and let me tell you about the dessert . <sssss> we had the white chocolate brownie , which was beyond amazing . <sssss> the place is usually pretty packed , so it can be a bit loud but there is ample seating both inside and out . <sssss> overall love the place , it is a bit pricey spent $ 60 on lunch for 2 people so heed that warning but aside from that , it 's amazing .
?		this was my second visit and my last . <sssss> i 'm a die hard lover of sushi and all things thai and man oh man when you get a bad serving of either one of those , you will never return and that is what happened on this occasion . <sssss> the sushi just did n't sit right and that 's not ever a good thing . <sssss> overall , on my prior visit the food and service was good but unfortunately this time , it was not and i ca n't see spending a good penny on something that is only 50/50 .
?		first visit was during happy hour on a friday at the scottsdale quarter . <sssss> let me just say , best damn happy hour around and not just cause of the drink specials . <sssss> the sushi specials can not be beat , dragon roll or las vegas roll for $ 6 ... that 's just insanely good . <sssss> the service is top notch , we did not go without anything . <sssss> i took a sip of my ice tea , she was there to replenish . <sssss> the whole experience was amazing . <sssss> the sushi can not be beat . <sssss> fresh and top quality and i know my sushi .
?		i love love love , did i mention love fox concept restaurants ? <sssss> having said that , i have to admit i was a bit disappointed by the menu and this location in general . <sssss> it was just mediocre . <sssss> nothing about it was bad and nothing about it was good . <sssss> if i were in the area again i might go in depending on my mood . <sssss> at this location , probably not , i would rather go to north . <sssss> also fox but damn good . <sssss> service was fair to average . <sssss> same with food .
?		this place is always beyond packed , even when the doors open . <sssss> on this particular visit , i was one of 15 people waiting in line when the doors opened . <sssss> i had just come out from a movie , was hungry and wanted the grilled chicken and hummus . <sssss> i forgot how pricey it can be $ 11 for just that one dish , but was pleasantly surprised by the portion size . <sssss> i waited about 15 minutes for my pick up order even though i called it in ahead of time and had to wait in line to get in the joint , which was less than awesome . <sssss> the service is never amazing , here or any of their locations . <sssss> the food is what gives the 3 star rating .
?		my review is for the happy hour . <sssss> we were lucky enough to score a table as we got to brio at exactly 4pm , had we waited 15 minutes and we would have been out of luck . <sssss> i 'm usually skepticl when it comes to hh menus but this place is amazing . <sssss> the food was $ 3 or $ 4 bucks a plate and the drinks around $ 5 depending on what you got . <sssss> the selection was fantastic and even better was the service . <sssss> there was 6 in our party and we ordered quite heavily on both the food and drink menus . <sssss> our server was on top of it . <sssss> he was pleasant and friendly and really added to the experience . <sssss> the food was out-friggin-standing . <sssss> we got the pepperoni/sausage flatbread and it was defnitely a favorite amongst everyone . <sssss> the deep fried raviolis were top notch too . <sssss> we got the lettuce wrap cups and sliders . <sssss> we also did dessert , i did the marscapone cheesecake and it was amazing . <sssss> i am now confident i will return many , many times .
?		i like centurion . <sssss> it 's got more space now after their expansion , and it 's a quirky , unusual experience . <sssss> you feel really close to the kitchen and chefs , and the food is always good . <sssss> it 's terrific that after 5pm weekday and all day saturday and sunday , street parking is completely free -lrb- so no need to add coins -rrb- . <sssss> trust me , i live downtown . <sssss> their 7 course tasting menu is unbelievably tasty -lrb- $ 50 for food only , $ 75 with wine pairings -rrb- . <sssss> the 21 % gratuity they automatically add though is highly annoying -lrb- 15 % is fine , 18 % okay , but 21 % is a mugging -rrb- . <sssss> service is good . <sssss> their risotto of the day is unbelievable -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- . <sssss> they make the best risotto in all of phoenix , in my opinion , and are creative their pizzas are good too , but maybe a dollar or two too expensive . <sssss> their mussels are also a standout and fairly priced . <sssss> personally , i 'd stick with the three above for an everyday dinner , and the tasting menu for a special occasion like an anniversary . <sssss> their brunch is also fun .
?		i 'm a cheap bastard with expensive tastes . <sssss> so my reviews are geared toward getting somewhat `` foody '' dishes at what i consider reasonable prices . <sssss> with that said , thirteen north gets one of my very rare 5 star reviews . <sssss> i only dined there once , for lunch . <sssss> it 's set in a strip mall , and easy to drive by without noticing . <sssss> but inside , it 's very nicely decorated for a great lunch or dinner place . <sssss> relatively modern , clean , welcoming . <sssss> we ordered the chips with crab dip -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- . <sssss> easily enough for 2-3 to share as an appetizer . <sssss> it was terrific , with freshly fried chips heavily seasoned with something zesty , similar to old bay seasoning , with a nice portion of crab dip . <sssss> felt it was an outstanding value , and we cleaned the platter . <sssss> i next had their 13 north burger -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- , cooked well done . <sssss> it was a healthy sized burger , cooked perfectly , with a nice bun . <sssss> the blue cheese really popped and gave it a terrific flavor , and the mounds of perfectly grilled onions complimented it nicely . <sssss> i was stuffed . <sssss> the french fries that came with it were fair , neither outstanding nor bad . <sssss> my lunch companion ordered sweet potato fries that came with a sweet chili sauce , which was a surprisingly good compliment . <sssss> three daily specials for lunch all sounded great and were a very reasonable $ 8 . <sssss> look , when you can get away with $ 30 for two for a two course lunch and are nicely full and feel the food was upscale , i consider that a great value . <sssss> i will be back for lunch , and probably also for a casual dinner . <sssss> if i lived around here , this would definitely be a neighborhood gem , and on a short list of reasonably priced lunch or dinner rotations . <sssss> give it a try .
?		went there for lunch . <sssss> split a chopped salad and a deviled eggs . <sssss> large portions . <sssss> salad was a bit heavy on sauce , but i liked it . <sssss> deviled eggs had some truffle oil which made them pretty good . <sssss> burger was gigantic . <sssss> ordered onion rings that were just not good at all ... must be frozen pre-bought , which sucks . <sssss> burger kind of tasted oily bland . <sssss> tried to add mustard , and it was n't terrible , but for an upscale burger at $ 12 expected just a bit better . <sssss> companion had sweet potato fries which were much better . <sssss> service even though the place was dead was very slow . <sssss> not unfriendly , but they need to realize people that go for a mid-week lunch usually do n't have 1.5-2 hours to eat . <sssss> all in all , it was n't a terrible experience . <sssss> i really like the ambience ... love the modern look of brick and blackened steel . <sssss> but i 'd probably be more interested in coming here for beers and drinks with a couple appetizers , than a sit-down meal . <sssss> for a meal , there are just much better central phoenix locations .
?		downside is you pay for street parking . <sssss> and tiny , tiny inside area where the owner claims he can squeeze in 25 people , but more than 10 is entirely too close for comfort . <sssss> go there when nice outside so you have best options . <sssss> food is generally pretty good . <sssss> had the mussels , which were tasty for $ 10 and pretty hearty sauce . <sssss> sandwiches were the biggest miss , but not terrible . <sssss> pizza was nice sized ... could easily fill two adults if they share an app and desert . <sssss> has pizza with truffle oil and pesto for like $ 12-14 , and it was excellent . <sssss> risotto looked good , but did n't try . <sssss> i will be back for sure . <sssss> my wife liked it more than i did , but i did n't dislike it much at all . <sssss> a pretty solid 3.5 to 4 star .
?		cheap beer . <sssss> strip mall bar . <sssss> big open space and tables . <sssss> tons of small tv 's with no sound . <sssss> tasty , greasy bar food . <sssss> i came here on a thursday night . <sssss> beer seemed really cheap ... clearly this is a great place to go if you want to drink with friends for not a lot of money . <sssss> i had a microbrew bottle special for $ 2.50 , for example , that was delicious . <sssss> because everyone raved about the wings , i tried some -lrb- jess jess , $ 9.50 for a dozen -rrb- . <sssss> i felt , like many do , that they are not `` saucy '' enough . <sssss> almost no sauce . <sssss> but they are good . <sssss> not great , not otherworldly , and not the best i 've had in phoenix . <sssss> but they are good , fair priced , and worth ordering if you are drinking beer and looking for an appetizer . <sssss> i ordered the candlestick carver , recommended by many . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> decent to good cuts of roast beef on sourdough -lrb- texas toast like -rrb- bread , with melted cheese and roasted peppers . <sssss> here 's a hint : ask for no mayo . <sssss> i like mayo , but they put like 5 tablespoons on , and it kind of ruined it , and with the dipping au jus suace , you do n't need it . <sssss> i finished mine , enjoyed every bite , was stuffed , and ate a few of the curley fries -lrb- these are just the cheap frozen premade stuff you find at most restaurants -rrb- . <sssss> my son ate the mac & cheese . <sssss> i did n't try , but it looked fine . <sssss> anyway , will i be back ? <sssss> perhaps . <sssss> it 's kind of a dive . <sssss> parking is fine . <sssss> serivce was nice . <sssss> beer selection and pricing is the strength of this restaurant . <sssss> food was good for a bar , maybe great . <sssss> but this is n't a gastropub . <sssss> not gourmet . <sssss> check those expectations at the bar . <sssss> i 'd think this is a great place to go with a group of coworkers for happy hour . <sssss> or a guys night out . <sssss> it 's casual enough for the family if you are looking for greasy food . <sssss> order the wings . <sssss> but do n't expect best of phoenix . <sssss> just expect solid wings . <sssss> if i was coming here again with just one other person , i 'd likely try a different appetizer to share , order a couple of their cheap beers , and probably eat their buffalo chicken sandwich to get the flavor of the buffalo wings without all the fatty skin . <sssss> and i 'd go home a pretty content man after signing the bill .
?		you ca n't go wrong with any dish at lucille 's unless you are on a restricted diet . <sssss> coming from the east coast , it 's been hard to find some great soul and southern style places to eat . <sssss> and lucille 's has fit the bill . <sssss> she has become a permanent part of my staple food . <sssss> every time i 've gone there , i always walk away happy . <sssss> the ice tea is sweet and goes with everything . <sssss> and it even comes in this glass drinking jar that makes drinking tea so much more fun and refreshing . <sssss> lucille has become a definite stop when family and friends are in town . <sssss> it 's a treat to see them marvel at how good the food is and serves as a good reason for them to come back . <sssss> trust me cause i 'm a picky eater !
?		cf is one of these places that i have to make a pilgrimage to at least once a year . <sssss> i love my boston cf better for some reason , maybe cause it 's home . <sssss> anyway , this past weekend , i took my hubby there to celebrate his bday and come to find out he has never eaten at a cf anywhere . <sssss> i almost fell when he spat out those words . <sssss> `` it 's a rite of passage , '' i find myself squealing out . <sssss> well , he loved it even though he could n't get over at how small the filet mignon looked on the plate . <sssss> however , it was my friend who ordered the jamaican dish with shrimp that had the best meal at the table . <sssss> i had a bite from her plate and my taste buds went into a convulsion , it was stupendous . <sssss> i had the salmon special . <sssss> it was good but nondescript . <sssss> the kentucky tea and the cherry cheesecake were real smooth and good for my taste palette . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong when you choose cf. i 'm so glad that hubby 's eyes and taste buds have opened up to the cf way of eating .
?		i 've eaten there a couple of times and enjoyed the food every single time . <sssss> if i do n't feel like cooking or want something wholesome to satisfy my hunger , it 's usually one of the first nearby places to come to mind . <sssss> it 's a plus that it 's connected to changing hands bookstore . <sssss> after a good for the soul meal , it 's a great place to get or browse good books for the soul . <sssss> avoid going there during lunch on a saturday afternoon . <sssss> it seems to be most of arizonans ' favorite place to chow down at that particular time . <sssss> it 's crowded and people seem cranky cause they 've been waiting in line too long and starving . <sssss> and yes , the line makes no sense . <sssss> it 's chaotic . <sssss> you do n't know where to stand nor who is in line . <sssss> so , you have to go around asking people repeatedly , `` are you in line ? '' <sssss> not cool if you are a shy person or do n't feel like talking to strangers .
?		my korean friend says this is the best there is in the phoenix area . <sssss> based on the clientele alone i would say they must be doing something right , it is a majority korean americans eating in there . <sssss> all your standards are delicious , try something new , you will not be disappointed . <sssss> another thing i love about korean food , is i feel good after i eat it , because it seems healthier than other asian cuisine . <sssss> more vegetables i guess . <sssss> they also serve korean wine and barley tea . <sssss> check those out .
?		tasty food , friendly staff , i can recommend brunch , especially on sundays . <sssss> wow sangria half price , what a deal ! <sssss> the 3 bruchettas recommended by the waitress were deliciious : proscuitto , tomato and ricotta . <sssss> i also had the peach jelly crepes , very light and lovely . <sssss> maybe a little too much jelly , but tasty . <sssss> my friend had the polenta brunch dish and enjoyed it . <sssss> sat outside and it was very pleasant . <sssss> towards the end they turned on the music which was a little loud . <sssss> i was there to catch up with an old friend and it made it a little hard to hear .
?		dim sum . <sssss> amazing selection and variety . <sssss> super friendly staff . <sssss> extremely affordable .
?		super fast delivery ... curry beef was amazing ! <sssss> large portions for the money !
?		awesome pizza with super friendly service .
?		the best fast food burger hands down . <sssss> ca n't beat leaving there for $ 5 and feeling stuffed . <sssss> i always get the country burger or the mexican burger .
?		being from la , im a huge fan of the diy kbbq experience so i was pretty sad to learn that most kbbq places in az didnt let you cook your own stuff on the table . <sssss> well , i was sad until a friend suggested we try takamatsu ! <sssss> grills on the table , baby ! <sssss> i am the master of my own meat domain ! <sssss> -lrb- stop laughing -rrb- . <sssss> i instantly loved this place the minute we walked through the door . <sssss> the smell was incredible ... all the tasty galbi , seafood , and bulgogi sizzling on the table top grills . <sssss> i was in heaven . <sssss> the menu was extensive and included some really good cuttlefish and cuts of meat . <sssss> we ordered a lot and ate a lot . <sssss> the quality of the vegetables , meats , and side dishes was excellent and i could n't have been happier . <sssss> the wait staff is extremely nice and personable , often coming to the tables to laugh and joke with you . <sssss> they are also really quick to fill up your glass or offer you another beer . <sssss> angels in meat heaven . <sssss> i 'm definitely coming here anytime i need a kbbq fix .
?		came here for a little wine and dinner with violeta h. the other night . <sssss> what a cute place ! <sssss> the decor is adorable and comfortable . <sssss> chairs are soft and comfy and the place is low lit but not too dark where you ca n't see your dining companion . <sssss> happy hour ends at 6 here , so get in while you can so you can try some of their more expensive wines for only $ 5 a glass . <sssss> i really recommend the marietta zinfandel . <sssss> it was so smooth and flavorful . <sssss> appetizers are also around the $ 5 mark during happy hour . <sssss> i dont recommend the prosciutto wrapped breadsticks . <sssss> they were alright , just kind of awkward . <sssss> dinner is reasonably priced and they offer all sorts of things from large entrees to paninis and salads . <sssss> the paninis are excellent and come with your choice of a side -lrb- soup/salad -rrb- . <sssss> the butternut squash soup was so creamy and rich , i could have kept eating it all night . <sssss> service was fast , friendly and attentive . <sssss> loved our waitress . <sssss> she was like a water ninja and she was really great about not rushing us and letting us catch up a bit . <sssss> they did have live music which i wasnt too fond of . <sssss> it was a little too loud and not really my speed . <sssss> other than that the whole evening was really enjoyable and i 'd definitely come back here again to hit up that happy hour .
?		first of all ... happy hour every day . <sssss> how could you go wrong with that ? <sssss> especially when they have a great selection of beers -lrb- domestic and craft from the area -rrb- that come in pitchers for just $ 5 . <sssss> awesome . <sssss> service was outstanding . <sssss> everyone was extremely friendly and i was impressed that the manager was so involved in the operations . <sssss> he was extremely nice and helped us get settled in to the restaurant -lrb- we apparently came in the wrong door -rrb- and even sent us over a complimentary pitcher because he felt bad that we were wandering around for a minute or two trying to find the entry kiosk . <sssss> so unnecessary but totally nice and really just impressed the boyfriend and me . <sssss> food was freaking delicious ! <sssss> i had the burger and it had to be one of the best i 've had since moving to az . <sssss> it was cooked perfectly -lrb- medium rare -rrb- and came on a bun that was just the right size to contain all the juicy deliciousness . <sssss> the fries were also outstanding ... extra crispy on the outside but soft and happy on the inside . <sssss> we also had the deviled egg dip for a starter . <sssss> it was like a picnic in my mouth . <sssss> another great thing about this place is churn next door . <sssss> how could you go wrong ice cream ? <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back here and try out the amazing patio for a sunday funday .
?		my husband and i were on our way home from vegas , and we decided to stop in phoenix for lunch . <sssss> we intended to go to another restaurant , but i stopped when we drove by gadzooks . <sssss> i did n't even have this place bookmarked , but i remembered hearing about it in the new times . <sssss> i 'm glad we came after the lunch rush because i might have frozen up from all the choices . <sssss> i went with the spinach/mushroom and potato enchiladas on the corn/flour tortillas and topped them with green sauce , pickled onions and guacamole . <sssss> i like that they are broiled right in front of you so they 're still piping hot at your table . <sssss> the tangy green sauce was great , and i liked both fillings , especially the sinful potatoes . <sssss> my husband got three different meat tacos ; his favorite was the bison . <sssss> the tortillas do n't really hold up for tacos , though . <sssss> his started falling apart after a few bites so he ended up eating them as enchiladas . <sssss> i 'm more than ready to go back and try more of the options .
?		i never imagined giving this place such a low rating after hearing all the buzz from various foodie sources , but here we are . <sssss> service was n't great although our server was nice enough once he finally came . <sssss> the water in the glass bottles was nice aesthetically , but it was way to warm to drink . <sssss> thank goodness we were on the patio so we could dump it out when a colder bottle came . <sssss> i 'm just surprised no one noticed how warm the first bottle was before serving it . <sssss> the other big misstep that really irked me was our two entrees came out separately . <sssss> we were doing the restaurant week menu so it 's not like we were eating family style . <sssss> my poor friend and i had awkwardly stare at my plate while we waited for hers to come out . <sssss> the presentation of the food perplexed me a bit . <sssss> there was too much `` assembly '' involved with our apps and desserts . <sssss> we both started with the jicama salad . <sssss> it was light and lovely , but there were some big pieces of black pepper in there that tickled our throats . <sssss> my friend said she liked her pork belly entree , but she never complains about anything -lrb- unlike yours truly -rrb- . <sssss> the chef made a special vegetarian fried rice for my entree . <sssss> i loved the flavor but the brussels sprouts were very chewy . <sssss> for dessert , my friend got the banana split which featured ice creams `` dots '' and a frozen , chocolate covered banana . <sssss> it was tasty , but she struggled to get through the frozen banana with just a spoon . <sssss> my tres leches was unlike any tres leches i 've ever had before , and i do n't mean that in a good way . <sssss> the cake was n't very moist , and i did n't like the copious pepitas and raisins topping it . <sssss> there was a nice cinnamon chocolate mousse on the side , though . <sssss> i would have enjoyed just eating that . <sssss> bink 's and binkley 's has earned enough praise from those in the know that it persuades me to write this off as an off night and give it another chance . <sssss> the patio area is lovely so i might be back when the temps go back to double digits .
?		i am delighted to have this place within walking distance of my house . <sssss> it 's a great place to have brunch with the neighbors , meet a friend for lunch , or just kill some time while you wait for your cleaning ladies to finish up . <sssss> i get iced coffee a lot , and i appreciate the stevia packets nearby since they dissolve quickly . <sssss> their chai is very good , more sweet than spicy . <sssss> breakfast is wonderful especially since they added some new menu items like the rosa sandwich with egg whites and pesto . <sssss> i also love the vegan benedict . <sssss> they really know how to season and cook tofu properly . <sssss> the san diegan is everyone 's favorite ; i sub avocado for bacon . <sssss> lunch is great too . <sssss> the tomato basil sandwich is one of the best veggie sandwhiches i 've ever had . <sssss> i often make my own version at home during the summer . <sssss> the vegan taco salad wrap is killer too . <sssss> i gave half to a meat and potatoes coworker , and he loved it ! <sssss> my husband and neighbor both love the turkey cranberry sandwich and order it almost every time we go . <sssss> they are known for their desserts for good reason . <sssss> scones are my favorite , perhaps because they contain an almost lethal amount of butter . <sssss> the vegan red velvet cupcake is much better than the one at sprinkles . <sssss> i 'm sure that it helps that it 's made by an actual vegan -lrb- one of the co-owners -rrb- . <sssss> i was hesitant to try the coffee and cigarettes cupcake , but my curiosity finally got to me . <sssss> i was surprised how much i liked it . <sssss> it was like a more flavorful and complex vanilla . <sssss> i 've never smoked so i could n't taste the tobacco , but my husband said the tobacco flavor is there .
?		love this place ! <sssss> first , big props to mr. johnston for renovating an old -lrb- for gilbert -rrb- buidling instead of doing a tear-down which is more common in the valley . <sssss> my architect cousin was seriously impressed with the structure . <sssss> i remember liberty market when it was a ghetto liquor store that sold some decent chorizo . <sssss> it 's wonderful to have this space turned into a great restaurant where you can meet up with friends for breakfast , lunch or dinner . <sssss> breakfast is yummy . <sssss> i always get the veggie scramble being a vegetarian . <sssss> it 's loaded with goat cheese so what 's not to love ? <sssss> biscuits , cinnamon buns , and sticky buns are fantastic . <sssss> for lunch and dinner , i stick with the caprese salad or sandwich . <sssss> their thin crust pizza is very good , but the caprese is exceptional so it 's hard to venture from it . <sssss> i 've had this dish all over town and while some places may have better bread -lrb- pane bianco -rrb- , the actual fillings are so much better at liberty market . <sssss> the other item i have a hard time straying from is the sweet potato salad . <sssss> it 's unreal ! <sssss> no mayo here , instead it 's tossed with chipotle -lrb- i think -rrb- flavored oil , craisins , and pecans . <sssss> on a side note , i would love it if liberty would over some veggie meat option a la capriotti 's so that i could try their other sandwiches . <sssss> desserts all kick ass . <sssss> i 've had the red velvet and carrot cakes here , both some of the best i 've had . <sssss> if you 're only going to get one dessert , make it the bread pudding . <sssss> a friend of mine who lived in france for two years said it was the best in the world . <sssss> it totally is ! <sssss> it 's a great value two considering you can share it among 3 + adults . <sssss> if you come here for nothing else , you must have some coffee . <sssss> as a coffee drinker , it would be an abomination for me to visit liberty and not get something from the e61 bar . <sssss> the last time i went i got an iced latte , and i was actually mad because it was * so * good . <sssss> mad , as in `` why is n't all espresso this good ? '' <sssss> and `` why do n't i drink this every day ? ''
?		i love twirl , and i 'm so thankful it 's far from where i live because i might become one of those people who thinks froyo is an acceptable meal replacement . <sssss> in a town full of identical shops , this is the only place that i will get froyo . <sssss> anything else is just a waste of calories . <sssss> it 's always a good time at twirl . <sssss> i 've been there 4 times , and there has never been more than two other customers there making it a very chill experience . <sssss> the midcentury modern decor really makes the ambience great . <sssss> i started off with the highly-touted caramel soft serve , but the praline and pumpkin pie flavors have really sealed my love of twirl . <sssss> topped off with the killer hot fudge or caramel , it 's a dessert worth craving . <sssss> i 'll be making lots of excuses to come back here .
?		a couple times a week , i go to a gym right next to joe 's real bbq , and i 'm so thankful i 'm a vegetarian because the smell coming from their smoker would undo my entire workout otherwise . <sssss> so am i qualified to review joe 's even though i abstain from meat ? <sssss> absolutely . <sssss> i ate many meaty meals at joe 's in my teens and 20s . <sssss> i actually worked there when i was a senior in high school , and i managed to gain the freshman 15 before starting college . <sssss> back in the day , my favorite was the turkey breast . <sssss> i dare you to find a more moist piece of white meat . <sssss> runner-up was the pulled pork , mostly because i loved to smother it in pickles and marinated onions . <sssss> i 'm not gon na lie ; my mouth is watering just thinking about the condiments . <sssss> my best friend , a north carolina native , loves their pulled pork because they toss it in a vinegar-based sauce in true nc style . <sssss> my husband and his friends all go gaga over the ribs , and brisket seems to be a crowd pleaser . <sssss> nowadays , i stick with the side dishes . <sssss> i love the cheesy potatoes -lrb- add scallions and douse in green tabasco -rrb- and mac and cheese . <sssss> the apple sauce , potato salad , and cole slaw are all items i 'm not normally a fan of , but at joe 's they are way above average and very delicious . <sssss> the restaurant has a great atmosphere . <sssss> it 's a great place to take kids , large groups , and out of towners . <sssss> it is spotlessly clean too . <sssss> a pharmacy school classmate used to do restaurant inspections , and she said joe 's was always immaculate . <sssss> service is wonderful too . <sssss> it says a lot about a restaurant when employees have stayed 10 + years . <sssss> on another note , i would encourage anyone who needs a caterer to consider joe 's real bbq . <sssss> everyone will love it , and their rates are very affordable . <sssss> i used them for my wedding and a housewarming party . <sssss> just last week , they catered my sister 's wedding , and they really went above and beyond for her to make sure her day went smoothly . <sssss> keeping her happy was no small feat !
?		i was n't super impressed the first time i tried five guys , so i figured i 'd give them a chance to redeem themselves . <sssss> alas , i 'm still pretty `` meh '' about them . <sssss> burger was okay , but the fries are super oily . <sssss> i know it 's peanut oil , so it 's supposed to be better for you , but seriously , by the time i got home , the paper bag was pretty much soaked through . <sssss> and , side note about this location , overall very clean , but no toilet seat covers in the restrooms ? <sssss> what are we , heathens ?
?		hooray for the reopening of china chili ! <sssss> the new location seems to be much larger than the old one and has way more parking -lrb- two lots ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the decor of the giant dining room is still pretty plain and the music was an odd selection varying between traditional asian music and kenny g. ambiance aside , i thoroughly enjoyed my favorite dish , sweet and sour chicken . <sssss> it was a radiant shade of orange and simply delicious , as always . <sssss> i especially appreciate the fact that they give you a larger portion of your dish than of white rice , a proportion skewed at some other asian restaurants . <sssss> i could have gone for a knife to cut up the giant pieces of chicken that make up the dish , but i powered through . <sssss> i 'm generally pretty picky about my chinese food , but china chili has n't yet let me down .
?		it makes me sad to say this , since i was so excited to pay a visit to this cute little place occupying what was once a pawn shop across the street from my high school , but i was not really impressed with lux . <sssss> i went twice in the course of a couple of weeks and the trips averaged a rating of `` eh . '' <sssss> trip # 1 : girl barista is nice , suggests upsizing from a small-sized chai latte to a medium because the small is only slightly larger than a shot glass . <sssss> it 's midweek in the p.m. so the place is n't too busy , making it a nice place to relax . <sssss> sadly , the chai is lackluster . <sssss> it tastes kind of watered down . <sssss> my friend has the velvet , which is way better . <sssss> when it 's time to leave , there is some confusion as to where the garbage can is located -lrb- answer : way in the back -rrb- . <sssss> trip # 2 : guy barista is a bit snotty . <sssss> again it 's suggested that i upsize to the medium -lrb- why even have the small really ? <sssss> -rrb- and then is a bit pissy when i tell him i really only want the velvet in a small . <sssss> i say no thank you to the whipped cream , trying to muster some sort of self-control . <sssss> when i go to pick up my drink , the barista is putting some whipped cream on my friend 's drink . <sssss> `` the whipped cream is really good , '' he tells me . <sssss> i hesitate , watching him dole out the tasty confection and he sees me . <sssss> `` you already said no , '' he says as he closes up the container and smugly puts it back under the counter . <sssss> now , maybe he 's trying to be funny , but if that 's the case , he needs to work on his delivery because it just comes off as being snotty . <sssss> the place is full of people tonight . <sssss> my friend and i sit on the white chairs up towards the front . <sssss> there are dirty plates and cups on all the tables and everything is just a bit askew . <sssss> it just feels a bit grimy . <sssss> my velvet is only okay . <sssss> it 's probably much better with the whipped cream . <sssss> overall , i just kind of got a pretentious vibe from the place . <sssss> i feel like i can get a tastier chai and way less attitude over at copper star .
?		my family and i parked our asses at the breakfast bar after a 45 minute wait . <sssss> and had a perfect breakfast . <sssss> ernie was delightful to chat with , but more importantly , the breakfasts were spot on . <sssss> great cakes , great scramble , amazing chunky breakfast potatoes , and am i imagining it or did i get served a bloody mary ? <sssss> hey , a guy can dream . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		best burger in town , best beet salad ever . <sssss> fries to die for . <sssss> banana split off the hook . <sssss> groovy ambience for dinner , casual chic for lunch . <sssss> my most recent trip , took a business partner for lunch . <sssss> wait was negligible at 12:30 , and the staff was fantastically friendly and attentive . <sssss> water refills are a luxury on a 95 degree day , and they were on the ball . <sssss> they have a great drink menu , including some fun beers that go well with the burgers . <sssss> i got the house lager this time , which was crisp and clean for the toasty day . <sssss> burger is to die for -- i think it 's gruyere , caramelized onions and a baguette . <sssss> skipped the fries this time and got the beet salad -- perfection with goat cheese and candied pecans . <sssss> reasonably priced -- $ 25 for beer , salad and burger . <sssss> sweet !
?		first trip to the new pischke 's spinoff was solid . <sssss> for those of you who never had the privilege of visiting the original scottsdale pischke 's when it was quality , it was a place with a beachy feel in old town scottsdale that served unique sandwiches , salads and lahvosh `` pizzas '' all day long . <sssss> they served light fare before it was hip . <sssss> it was good stuff . <sssss> so drop your waah waahs about palatte being gone -lrb- yes , i cried too -rrb- and be glad that someone 's trying something old and new in that beautiful space . <sssss> we got the tons-of-shrimp and pesto lahvosh , which was luxurious and brought back memories . <sssss> my atomic burger , with horseradish , was zingy and delicious , on a decent bun . <sssss> fries were great , chile-lime spiced . <sssss> we also ordered the fernando 's chicken sandwich , a tangle of wine , chicken , jack , tomatoes and pepperoncinis . <sssss> not as awesome as the burger , but good -- i think the bread overwhelmed the fillins . <sssss> service was friendly , food was piping hot . <sssss> atmosphere was fine , could probably use a little more character somehow but i do n't know what that 'd be . <sssss> we 'll definitely go back to try the salads , sandwiches , fish tacos , and a different lahvosh .
?		we arrived at 8 , were told it was a two hour wait on the patio , and we were seated within an hour . <sssss> waiting with perfect margaritas was great -- but the salsa choices suck and the chips were a little stale . <sssss> there 's red-hot red and fiery tomatillo , and the gringo in our group could n't enjoy chips n salsa at all . <sssss> maybe there 's a third option they do n't tell you about ? <sssss> i dunno . <sssss> the red salsa tasted like the red peppers you sprinkle on pizza , blended with oil in a cuisinart . <sssss> not my favoritestyle -- i prefer a touch more of the tomato . <sssss> my carnitas were pretty bland , frankly , but everything else our table ordered was pretty solid . <sssss> chimis and enchiladas with flavorful , nasty-hot green and red sauces . <sssss> this is one place where i 'd actually order a hamburger on the side for your out of town guests , just in case they ca n't stand the heat . <sssss> a phoenix legend that everyone should try for themselves . <sssss> i got unlucky this time with my order -- ten years ago i remember loving whatever i had .
?		any of the broken rice dishes are really good !
?		delicious breakfast food that you can tailor to your liking . <sssss> laid-back , california cafe feel with friendly servers . <sssss> the coffee was very good and the server was great at keeping our cups filled . <sssss> although all our meals were supposed to come with toast , we substituted it with a single buttermilk pancake . <sssss> i 'm so glad that we did ! <sssss> the pancakes were so good ! <sssss> practically melted in your mouth . <sssss> 1 -rrb- white flannel with green chile was what the server recommended and it was good ! <sssss> -lrb- corned beef , white onions , mushrooms , and garlic cooked with potatoes -rrb- 2 -rrb- garlic mushroom scramble -lrb- garlic , shallot , crimini mushrooms , and swiss covered with garlic mushroom sherry cream sauce , and scallion -rrb- 3 -rrb- the hatch -lrb- house roasted green chili , white onion , garlic , chicken , and manchego cheese -rrb-
?		stopped in for a quick drink & instantly fell in love with the place . <sssss> loved how they had fresh ingredients . <sssss> i ca n't remember the name of my drink -lrb- it had kale , cucumber , ginger , etc -rrb- but i loved it - very refreshing ! <sssss> -lrb- although i think it would be an acquired taste for most - a little too much green ingredients for some ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the pomegranate ginger cider was really good too . <sssss> i took a peak at what people were ordering for their meals - it looked pretty good & their menu sounded promising .
?		3.5 stars pretty good gelato chain restaurant with a decent selection of gelatos at normal prices .
?		although i 'm no chicago native , i 've been there and can say that this place does n't do chicago dogs justice . <sssss> we ordered the jumbo chili cheese dog , italian beef , fries , and a burger . <sssss> everything just tasted okay . <sssss> the italian beef was the one item that was pretty decent .
?		loved their portobello sandwich ! <sssss> the pizza is pretty good as well although not quite like a ny pizza : -rrb-
?		my husband and i brought my mom here when she was visiting to grab breakfast . <sssss> they were a bit unorganized . <sssss> the food was okay , but the service was pretty slow -lrb- constantly had to flag down someone for refills of coffee -rrb- , but they were nice .
?		went around 10:30 on a sunday morning and did n't wait much more than 20 minutes for a table for 2 -lrb- first available . <sssss> -rrb- very quicks service to place orders and receive food -- a little slower on drink refills . <sssss> the prices are decent for the location . <sssss> it 's a fun atmosphere and if you can snag a table outside , it would be a great place to take out of town guests or someone really looking to enjoy the weather during breakfast . <sssss> i had the lox omelette - smoked salmon , capers , and red onions . <sssss> incredibly salty -lrb- which is to be expected , but this was kinda unreal -rrb- but pretty good . <sssss> the bloody mary was n't my favorite , but then again i did n't try the bacon bloody mary ... maybe next time .
?		lots of healthy options , and very gluten-free friendly . <sssss> kind of a weird location , hidden in the innards of those jungle-looking condos by fashion square that you always drive by and think , `` g-d , those must be amazing ! '' <sssss> we went for lunch on a saturday afternoon , and there were about 3 tables , one of which already had their food . <sssss> our entrees took a while to come out , and were decent -- we had the quiche with spinach and bacon . <sssss> the quinoa crust was a big strange and tangy , but the fruit on the side was perfect , as was the appetizer of sweet potato fries . <sssss> the atmosphere was just so dead , and the servers were nice but did n't do much to liven it up . <sssss> try it if you 're in the area and want -lrb- for the most part -rrb- feel-good food . <sssss> i heard the cinnamon rolls are amazing -- and as they should be , they 're 330 calories per serving , and one roll is 2 servings !
?		great food , but the service leaves much to be desired . <sssss> i was meeting family , and when they arrived , they were told it would be a 10 minute wait for a table . <sssss> no problem . <sssss> i get to yasu about 10 minutes later and my family is still waiting at the bar with no drinks and no one has checked in with them . <sssss> the hostess walks by several times as we try to politely make eye contact with her . <sssss> finally she comes over and offers us water , which is great , but we really wanted a few beers ... but water is ok , i guess ? <sssss> then she tells us it will be `` a little bit longer '' for a table . <sssss> i asked how long she estimated -- she said `` a little bit '' again , then `` another 10-15 minutes . '' <sssss> or we could sit at the sushi bar . <sssss> fine , we 'll sit at the bar . <sssss> we sit down only to realize the sushi bar is , duh , in front of the sushi bar , but the window is blocked with fabric so you ca n't actually see anything . <sssss> what 's the point of a sushi bar seating then ? <sssss> once we ordered service improved , but it was still a fairly long wait to get our rolls . <sssss> one sushi chef was literally yelling at the waitress to bring a spoon to a specific table ... professional ! <sssss> it seemed like the place had a lot of potential but they needed a floor manager to be paying attention . <sssss> the rolls were good , the salmon sashimi was awesome , and prices were n't outrageous . <sssss> hopefully the service improves and the place will be a gem .
?		we went to zupas on the recommendation of some friends . <sssss> i was excited to try it since i am a huge sucker for sandwiches and salads . <sssss> it 's a very bright place with a ton of people behind the counter to help . <sssss> the menu is pretty large and you can build your own salads if you want . <sssss> i have been here a couple times and i would say the sandwiches are not bad . <sssss> they are pretty basic and not something you would drive out of your way for . <sssss> the salads were more memorable for me . <sssss> great selections of salads and very fresh . <sssss> the soups are very salty . <sssss> i will go back to cafe zupas , but i wished it was a little more than it is .
?		mediocre at best . <sssss> not too tasty . <sssss> salsa blah , beans and rice too salty . <sssss> only thing i feel confident in recommending is the mexican pizza app w / chicken . <sssss> big enough to share . <sssss> other than that , the price is too expensive for the food served .
?		the concept was a great one , but the festival and the food trucks were no where close to prepared for the amount of people that showed up . <sssss> not sure if it was great marketing or groupon , but there were way too many people there or way too few of food trucks . <sssss> if this event happens again next year i would advise to either double or triple the amount of food trucks or cap the number of attendees . <sssss> i would also advise of having this at a different venue or get new traffic control management . <sssss> this was our day in a nutshell . <sssss> waited 45 minutes to park . <sssss> this was a little frustrating , but we were so excited it did n't seem that bad . <sssss> once we entered the event we noticed right away the lines for the food trucks were very long . <sssss> we game planned to split up and get in two lines . <sssss> little did we know the lines were so slow . <sssss> at one food truck there was a line to get tickets then go to another line -lrb- epic hotdogs -rrb- . <sssss> almost an hour and a half later we finally get some food . <sssss> the hotdog was cold and obviously the ingredients had changed a little bit while we were in line . <sssss> the had ran out of some ingredients and were improvising . <sssss> so frustrating . <sssss> needless to say we were able to hit only one more truck each , unfortunately we did n't go to this event to be separated . <sssss> the next food truck the owner of the truck -lrb- gourmet frybreads -rrb- was extremely rude and obviously overwhelmed with the situation . <sssss> we all left hungry and very let down . <sssss> i have n't even talked about the cost of everything . <sssss> i had no problem with the $ 5 parking and the $ 10 cover if things were the way i expected . <sssss> everything was way too expensive for the experience . <sssss> the food was way overpriced . <sssss> $ 4 for a half a hotdog . <sssss> $ 6.50 for a frybread with beans ? <sssss> really , now the food trucks are gouging us ! <sssss> $ 7 beer ? <sssss> well if you wait at the tent for a beer it 's $ 3 . <sssss> the $ 7 beer seemed like a better deal seeing i did n't have to wait 45 minutes . <sssss> i hate to write reviews like this because i am just repeating what others are saying . <sssss> if you decide to do this event next year i am sure you will make adjustments . <sssss> it will have to be a lot for us to go back . <sssss> great concept but horrible execution .
?		went here for a fantasy draft the other night and was dissapointed . <sssss> i have gone to half moon a bunch of times now and i have to say the service trys their best and the food is typical pub grub . <sssss> tonight i was really surprised to see that my drinks were very watered down . <sssss> i expect that on a busy night the service may be a tad off . <sssss> and i do n't expect a 5 star meal at a sportsbar . <sssss> the 2 stars are for the one thing that half moon should never have a problem with , making a drink . <sssss> i like half moon because they are close by , but i may have to make the extra trip to zipps this football season .
?		okay , this is n't usually our first choice for quick mexican food , but sometimes you do n't want to feel so guilty after you eat a burrito . <sssss> the blue burrito offers a healthier version of classic burritos . <sssss> although it is n't as good as carolina 's it is a good choice if you are trying at least a little bit to be somewhat healthier . <sssss> yeah , we would much rather scarf down a bean and cheese at carolina 's , but not being able to run the trails in az in the summer makes blue burrito our choice every now and then . <sssss> love the salsa bar , good salsa options with warm chips .
?		food is super tasty ! <sssss> ca n't go wrong with the turkey panini with pesto or bruschetta with prosciutto , figs & mascarpone cheese . <sssss> mouth watering just thinking about it . <sssss> sundays during 11-3 they offer cool laid back tunes by walt richardson and $ 5 refreshing white sangria . <sssss> a great way to relax at the end of the weekend .
?		the only thing i can write a review on is the breakfast croissant i ordered and the ambiance . <sssss> first off , the decor is cool and i like the quaint little coffee house with surprising seating inside . <sssss> the outside seating is a little less appealing being pretty much right on camelback . <sssss> has a great feel to the place . <sssss> the breakfast croissant was fairly plain . <sssss> you would be much better off getting a la grande commuter sandwich . <sssss> the croissant seemed store bought and i only got like one strip of bacon on it . <sssss> probably do n't need it so i guess not too bummed about that . <sssss> hopefully the food can be improved . <sssss> i will give the coffee a try next time and update my experience at carmel 's .
?		i will not be visiting la piccola again . <sssss> i hate writing this review and i really felt like not writing one at all . <sssss> i feel like i really need to let this business know where they are falling short . <sssss> i do want to give a very positive review of our waitress . <sssss> she was in training , but she was attentive and was our only enjoyment of the night . <sssss> the two glaring problems with la piccola : the food : did not taste fresh at all . <sssss> it was something we all picked up on . <sssss> my cous cous was overcooked and very bland . <sssss> my chicken was seasoned well , but not cooked all the way and my asparagus was damn near raw . <sssss> let 's just say i did n't finish my meal . <sssss> i am only going to review my meal , but the others in our party were all disappointed . <sssss> the owner andy : is definitely not a good front of house . <sssss> he really should manage in the back . <sssss> we were treated poorly by the owner , who has a rude and had an arrogant way about him . <sssss> i did n't touch my cous cous and andy thought it was because my palate was n't sophisticated enough . <sssss> he did n't even think that maybe there was something wrong with it . <sssss> i think andy believes his restaurant is earth shattering here in the valley , but in reality it is just another unmemorable place under the sun .
?		just a quick update ... bertha 's was unable to renew their lease and will be shut down for a month or two while they move to a new location . <sssss> i think they are supposed to relocate by the end of june somewhere near indian school and 32nd st , so just make sure to call before `` popping in '' -lrb- i heard a new cafe may be going in at bertha 's current location -rrb- .
?		love , love , love the zereshk pollo ! <sssss> i 'm not very knowledgeable about persian dishes , but the saffron rice with barberries -lrb- zereshk -rrb- is an incredible combination of flavors . <sssss> the portions are much larger than they appear in the pictures on the menu ... the plates are enormous . <sssss> be prepared for leftovers .
?		i got ta admit , i 've spent several happy hours out on the patio at brio . <sssss> our usual server is a cute young thing and he always remembers our tastes . <sssss> while i 'd like some drink specials for happy hour , you ca n't complain about a $ 2.95 appetizer list ... and everything tastes pretty good . <sssss> by everything , i mean we ordered one of everything and went through 4 bottles of wine our first time there . <sssss> it 's also a terrific people watching spot ; leave it to scottsdale to have constant traffic at the valet out front when there 's a half-empty parking garage 10 feet away . <sssss> recommendations : the flavor of the shrimp with eggplant was great -lrb- i would n't call it spicy , though -rrb- , and the roasted red pepper bruschetta was really tasty as well -lrb- despite the fact that i hate peppers -rrb- .
?		so i only went here because it was 10 on a sunday night , and i guess all mexican restaurants in the area close before then . <sssss> so this was the last option . <sssss> and i was really surprised . <sssss> the manager offered us free drinks , i had the best tostada in town , and the chips and salsa were really good too . <sssss> overall , we paid 10 bucks for a great meal . <sssss> by the way , if you like people-watching , this place is a must-go . <sssss> my boyfriend and i were entertained the entire time !
?		i wanted to like this place a lot . <sssss> i really did . <sssss> i stayed here for work & it seems like an overpriced , wanna-be luxury hotel . <sssss> it 's like they do n't quite have the luxury hotel feel or execution , but they want to charge for it . <sssss> i mean , the pool and rooftop bar are the only thing really keeping this above a one-star rating . <sssss> it was disappointing that they just could n't nail the simple things . <sssss> for example , a friend ordered a burger , and got it on toasted bread . <sssss> the server explained that they ran out of hamburger buns . <sssss> really ??? <sssss> $ 300 a night and they ca n't do a hamburger right ? <sssss> i appreciated the modern designs and look of the place , but the feel of it all just does n't match .
?		i love pinnacle peak park ! <sssss> even the park ranger people are so sweet . <sssss> we just moved to the area and i love hiking anyways , so it this is just the cream of the crop ! <sssss> i had to write a review today because we saw a bobcat tonight !!!! <sssss> yes , a real-life bobcat ! <sssss> it was so little that i was only scared for the first second
?		my teachers always said `` do n't judge a book by the cover . '' <sssss> and z 's greek completely proves their point ! <sssss> a co-worker suggested z 's greek , and i obliged since i was feeling quite indecisive . <sssss> as soon as we pulled into the parking lot , i immediately regretted that decision . <sssss> i was brainstorming excuses left and right of the reasons why i `` was n't hungry '' or was worried about how greek food would `` settle . '' <sssss> then a lush , green , scrumptious looking salad came out of the kitchen . <sssss> i ordered one . <sssss> pronto . <sssss> it had tons of lettuce , a really tasty dressing , the perfect amount of cheese , and gyro meat ... and i did n't want the lunch to end ! <sssss> the salad itself is to die for , the lettuce is always crisp , the tomatoes always juicy , and the pita points on the side just finish it off perfectly . <sssss> granted the wobbly booth was n't the most comfortable seat , and the ambiance was sort-of nonexistent . <sssss> but man , their food and friendly service will keep me coming back .
?		first , let me say i really hate to give bad reviews . <sssss> i love to support local business owners . <sssss> i drove 15 miles to buy cake pops but when i arrived they were out . <sssss> the young lady working behind the counter could have taken the time to nicely explain why they were out of cake pops , instead she wanted to be rude ! <sssss> i decided to go ahead and order some cupcakes , they were rated best cupcake by new times so they had to be good , right ? <sssss> well they were just okay . <sssss> nothing to brag about . <sssss> i would have gone back to buy the cake pops but based on the rude service , i will not return .
?		we went for a late lunch and had a wonderful experience ! <sssss> we had the chicken artichoke soup and it was the best soup i have ever had . <sssss> the staff was fast and very friendly . <sssss> we will be going back !!!
?		i use to really enjoy this restaurant but lately not so much . <sssss> the food comes out cold and when you send it back they reheat it instead of making you something fresh . <sssss> this use to be one of my favorite places to eat , too bad !
?		i have liked lux the most of all the coffee shops i 've tried in phoenix so far . <sssss> i should have gone here months ago ! <sssss> it was just lovely on a july day . <sssss> interior has a fantastic , simple feel . <sssss> the temperature was refreshing . <sssss> my iced chai latte was delicious . <sssss> i 'm going to change that to five stars . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		* sigh * i do love z pizza . <sssss> if you dine in , you can get two slices -lrb- usually pepperoni or cheese -rrb- and a beer for $ 7 , or you can get a whole big pizza pie - we usually get ours delivered . <sssss> the best one i 've had is the greek , but i am intrigued by the moroccan and the tuscan mushroom . <sssss> the staff is usually frazzled but still friendly and helpful , and it is a chain but a chain which i have no problem supporting . <sssss> they always deliver on time , and to the right place , which is something pizza places back in minneapolis could never seem to get the hang of . <sssss> i might have to get some z pizza tonight . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		we were in search of thai or chinese on christmas eve night , and stopped into thai hut . <sssss> i actually have been avoiding this place since reading some reviews describing some downright atrocious service as of late . <sssss> however , we stopped in at 9.05 -lrb- the sign said closed at 9.00 -rrb- and were told as long as we ordered take-out it was okay . <sssss> now , i 've worked long enough in the restaurant industry to feel incredibly guilty about ordering even ten minutes before the official closing time . <sssss> i have been the victim of a -lrb- wonderful but demanding -rrb- restaurant owner who stayed open 10 , 20 , 30 minutes past when you thought you 'd be long gone and well on your way towards an evening of lord knows what . <sssss> however , about 7 other people came in after us , which made me feel -lrb- almost all -rrb- better . <sssss> we had planned on having a beer at the counter but decided to make it quick . <sssss> our fried rice was delish , though mine was a little bit brown -lrb- too much oil ??? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> at any rate , it tasted fantastic . <sssss> maybe the quality of service depends on who is in charge ? <sssss> this time it was a very no-nonsense woman .
?		bookman 's ... wow . <sssss> i really should never buy books or cds anywhere else . <sssss> this place has amazing selection . <sssss> they also have a pretty fair trade-in policy . <sssss> i think we still have $ 15 credit from when we went here last month ... i 'm sure we 'll get around to spending it . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		i think this is my favorite bar in phoenix ... not that i go out nearly as much as i used to in my college days , or that i 've tried most of the bars here ... but i found a place i like and i see no reason not to go back . <sssss> we went on a saturday , which was on the quieter side at first but ended up pretty busy . <sssss> they had a cool local band playing -lrb- sonorous -rrb- which really worked well in the space . <sssss> the bartender last night was very friendly . <sssss> they have cheap pbr , tons of beer , and a decent wine list . <sssss> this place makes for a chill night .
?		the ratings by other yelpers was accurate . <sssss> . <sssss> yelpers ! <sssss> food is expensive and average ... $ 15 marg with don julio ... $ 4.00 taco 's -lrb- small -rrb- and stuffed chili with chicken was $ 19.00 , ... best item was the fresh of the guacamole & chips . <sssss> . <sssss> -- probably be back for happy hour sometime but will pass on dinner or lunch . <sssss> . <sssss> 2 for dinner and 2 drinks each and the bill was 90.00 ... oh we 'll . <sssss> .
?		always good food ! <sssss> , pho da lat is he best in phx , veggie broth , veggie pho with steamed tofu is awesome , and do n't forget to order the quail appetizer : -rrb- . <sssss> .
?		over priced and small portions for the $ $ $ . <sssss> do n't waste your time or money . <sssss> service is average , . <sssss> . <sssss> more of a bar , no draft beers i find odd , tons of better sushi restaurants in scottsdale and phoenix !!! <sssss> just believe in yelp they rated this 3.5 , i should of listened to my friends : -rrb- . <sssss> .
?		awesome place . <sssss> went here when i lived here with no expectations , but thought it was really well done and really cool stuff here . <sssss> be sure to go once during the day and once at night . <sssss> people of all ages will like this .
?		this is one of those hidden pizza places with some of the best pizza . <sssss> it is very under rated and very good . <sssss> it is worth a visit . <sssss> do n't be distracted by the weird crappy location of the backside of the retail strip mall . <sssss> it is worth it .
?		this is some of the best food in tempe . <sssss> i did n't find this place until i had lived in the area for 3 years . <sssss> i wish i knew about it sooner , because i only got about 6 months of this before i had to move . <sssss> the recipes are great and they are very vegetarian friendly . <sssss> the dessert ones are great , and the drink specials are awesome too . <sssss> always cheap irish car bombs .
?		i have visited this locale on a few occasions now and i must say there is nothing like it in all the valley and perhaps the state itself . <sssss> they host tons of events throughout the year and the yelp party that was held here in 2010 was epic . <sssss> i highly recommend going at night ... but watch for the critters ... lol ... both animal and human ... lol . <sssss> there does n't have to be an event there to go visit though ... if you just want some peace and quiet ... enjoy a beautiful sunrise or sunset ... or just take a romantic stroll with that special someone ... then this is your place . <sssss> eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!!!!
?		the outdoor seating could become legendary at this location once more people learn about it . <sssss> i mean it is simply magnificent ... go at night if you can and i can promise you it is romantic ... exotic ... and exciting all rolled into one . <sssss> since it is near the ipic theatre in the scottsdale quarter ... it makes for a great location to go and grab dinner once your movie has concluded . <sssss> the most awesome thing about the whole place though is the fire cauldrons that are located near the escalators as you walk into the restaurant ... wow . <sssss> so if your ever in the quarters and want something a little different but yet the same at least by scottsdale 's lofty standards ... then pay a visit to tanzy . <sssss> eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!!
?		great organic fruits and veggies ... very clean store ... great customer service ... fantastic deli dept. ... fresh fruits and veggies -lrb- non-organic -rrb- ... and outstanding deals every week . <sssss> i know some people say it is overpriced a bit and that is true to an extent ... but the sales ad that comes every week is a must see and you will always find plenty of affordable items . <sssss> eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!
?		visited this locale probably 3 times in the last couple of weeks and each time i come here the deals are great ... and the lines are long ... lol . <sssss> if your in search of baby clothes they have some true steals here ... not to mention women 's clothing is very affordable as well . <sssss> i did n't find anything that really suited me ... the sizes are not very wide ranging and the quality of the clothing looks suspect to me ... but after all it is h & m ... so i guess i should n't expect to much . <sssss> it is a nice store however ... and the staff is very friendly ... but seems like on some days they are a little understaffed and that can make for some long lines . <sssss> i do find however that a lot of people shop here ... and with this location being in scottsdale ... well the store ca n't be all bad . <sssss> eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!

?		wow ... i have to say i am stunned by some of these reviews i have read . <sssss> the arizona mills mall is one of the best `` discount malls '' i have ever been to ... and trust me i am a mall rat so i know what i am talking about . <sssss> this mall reminds me a lot of the gurnee mills mall in chicago . <sssss> it is rare when you can find a mall with outlet stores , discount stores , and pretty good entertainment and food to boot . <sssss> i will admit that it maybe does n't have the flair of scottsdale fashion square mall or the biltmore mall ... but you can afford to shop at arizona mills at least . <sssss> look people you ca n't have your cake and eat it to ... we are always complaining about getting good deals when we shop ... well arizona mills offers that ... the others do n't . <sssss> we say we want somewhere nice to shop with nice items and nice tenants ... well fashion square and biltmore offer that ... but again no real deals are to be had . <sssss> i guess what i am saying if you are going to the mall to really shop ... then arizona mills is your place . <sssss> if your going to walk around ... window shop ... and try to look cute then maybe you should head to scottsdale or biltmore ... just saying people . <sssss> eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!!!
?		i have been to this little slice of soda pop heaven on two occasions now ... just recently this past saturday 8/14/10 . <sssss> now trust me if you want to revisit you childhood days of going to the local mom and pop store in your hood and searching for that ice cold favorite drink of yours ... then you have to visit this locale . <sssss> they have every soda pop you can imagine both domestic and international . <sssss> the also have various kinds of bottled water , tonics , sports drinks , energy drinks , and other specialty drinks . <sssss> the also have something that will definitely be a blast from the past for most of you that visit that shop ... penny , nickel , and dime candies ... that 's right just like when you were kids . <sssss> brace yourself now ... they have moon pies ... chicklets ... fireballs ... blowpops ... tootsie pops ... wax lips ... junior mints ... sugar daddy 's ... boston baked beans ... liquid wax bottles ... and many many more . <sssss> now the first time i went they did n't have any faygo pop except root beer in the can ... i was very disappointed but the gentleman took my name and number and promised to call me when he got more flavors in . <sssss> he called me on saturday 8/14/2010 and that is why i am writing this review today ... because he was a man of his word . <sssss> i arrived at the shop and they had even more soda pop choices than the first time i went ... and they even had more candy options as well . <sssss> i am a huge fan of faygo creme soda because faygo is the `` official pop '' lol for the state of michigan . <sssss> . <sssss> so needless to say i grew up drinking alot of faygo soda when i was a kid . <sssss> so i ended buying 4 bottles of creme soda , one grape , and one rocking rye ... which is a cola creme soda i bought for my wife . <sssss> faygo also comes in orange and red pop ... which is cherry ... but i did n't get those this time . <sssss> now be advised this place is not cheap ... i spent a little over 8 bucks for my 6 pack of soda ... which comes in faygo 's original 12oz long neck bottles . <sssss> while the soda can be a little expensive per bottle . <sssss> . <sssss> you get a little discount for buying in bulk ... and it is totally worth it to have a little slice of joy from your childhood days . <sssss> so if your ever longing for that cold soda that you use to long for on a hot summer day when you were a kid ... and maybe a sweet treat to go along with it ... well you can stop looking ... just head over to `` pop the soda shop '' in scottsdale . <sssss> eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!
?		i have to admit when i first visited mojo 's i was skeptical because it was the first frozen yogurt establishment that i had ever visited in arizona . <sssss> i did n't know about red mango at the time or any of the other establishments that i have reviewed on yelp pertaining to frozen yogurt . <sssss> i walked into the establishment and thought i was walking into a plush nightclub ... the marble floors , the lighting , the seating , the whole setup was very posh ... i could n't believe it . <sssss> it has enough space and sample cups for you to truly enjoy the bounty of flavors and fresh fruit toppings they have . <sssss> it costs about 42 cents an ounce , which is a little high ... but no one seems to mind as the place is always packed . <sssss> as for the yogurt well it is simply delicious and again the atmosphere of the place is so calming despite the crowds . <sssss> i always go to the one @the biltmore just because it is closest to my house but it is very upscale so to speak and i like the mostly adult scene over there . <sssss> i know there have been some complaints about the kids ... but usually when i go it is not a problem whatsoever . <sssss> so if your ever in the mood for some great frozen yogurt ... give mojo a whirl . <sssss> eat , drink and be merry my friends !!!!
?		cajun/creole in the west valley ... wow what a treat . <sssss> now while on this day i did n't have any of the food entree 's ... i did have the dessert . <sssss> the special today was peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream ... and let me state for the record it was the best peach cobbler i have ever had served to me in restaurant . <sssss> now trust me when i tell you ... if it is on the menu the day you decide to visit this establishment ... . <sssss> order it asap . <sssss> the reason i say that is because it is not on the everyday menu ... that really needs to change by the way . <sssss> if you have read any of my other reviews you will notice i am a bit of an expert when it comes to eating out and having great food ... well you can add this review to that list . <sssss> i do n't know when i will be passing through these neck of the woods again ... but when i do `` flavors of louisiana '' will definitely be a `` must stop '' . <sssss> eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!!!
?		i love psc . <sssss> known colloquially as `` sandwhich shop !!! '' <sssss> it 's like an oasis in the drunken wasteland of 3 am old town . <sssss> psc is open 24 hours , and any restaurant in phoenix that is such gets an automatic 3 stars in my book , no matter how abysmal their service/food is . <sssss> luckily , the sandwiches here are great . <sssss> and after a few dozen cocktails , they are absolute perfection . <sssss> not to say that this is purely `` drunk food . '' <sssss> it 's probably not . <sssss> i think psc 's food is legit , and i hope that they do n't get pigeon-holed into that category , but i have n't ever really been here in the day so i 'm not really sure how i would react to the place in the sunlight . <sssss> but if you could n't already tell from the previous reviews , this place gets rushed by the drunks when the surrounding bars close at 2 . <sssss> it can get packed in here . <sssss> claustrophobia-inducing , fire-code-violation packed in the insatiable lust for roast beef and provolone . <sssss> sometimes there 's a bit of a wait , but biting into a piping hot , mastercrafted 9th street -lrb- spinach , roasted peppers , and cheese -rrb- makes it all worth while . <sssss> yes it does . <sssss> highlight : psc is the only place that provides an arena for the crowds of bs west , saddle ranch , and axis/radius to mingle together in intoxicated greasebomb love .
?		i would give b.o.b. a 3-star rating , but that extra star comes as a direct result of the amazing selection of draft beers this place has . <sssss> their lineup features lots of domestic specialty brews and a surprising amount of other stuff available . <sssss> plus , since they rotate the selection so much , the bartenders are happily willing to give samples of what 's new , which is the way it should be . <sssss> i got no puzzled faces , groans or stinginess . <sssss> the service we had was attentive and the food was good . <sssss> my friend ordered the `` interactive '' guacamole and the waitress came out and made it right then and there at the table . <sssss> overall , i was impressed ! <sssss> beer lovers beware , untold deliciousness awaits you inside , beneath the ski decor and deers ' heads .
?		i like buffalo exchange , but you have to look at this place like this : - it 's not a thrift store . <sssss> - i do n't ever try to sell/trade anything . <sssss> there 's no point . <sssss> the buyers are very inconsistent and it 's completely subjective and left to their personal taste . <sssss> but that 's the way it usually is , anyway . <sssss> - you do have to devote some time to the racks . <sssss> but you can find things here if you try . <sssss> `` so you 're not going to take these jeans because after an hour of scrutiny over this one tiny run in the fabric they 're just not of good enough quality ? <sssss> yet this leather jacket with the pen-stabbing hole in the front is $ 30 ? <sssss> ... how about half off ? '' <sssss> `` 25 % '' `` 30 % '' `` deal . '' <sssss> yes , i haggle on almost everything . <sssss> if you 're going to pass on my slightly damaged items , then i am paying less than what 's marked for your slightly damaged items already on the rack . <sssss> so if you treat it like a guatemalan linen bazaar like i do , you can save some money .
?		one 's experience at kazmierz can really depend on when you go and who you go with . <sssss> moreso than most places , it seems . <sssss> for example , one night i came here with some friends and it was packed to the brim with obnoxious socialites getting wasted on their husbands ' amexes . <sssss> i felt like i could have had the same deal across the street with a smirnoff ice at saddle ranch . <sssss> but on my last visit to kazmierz it was quiet and mellow with middle eastern music in the air . <sssss> i also sat next to a tipsy `` francesca '' at the bar who claimed to be able to read my aura . <sssss> i for one , love kazmierz for the little elitist comments peppered throughout the wine menu and the general nose-positioned-firmly-upward attitude about wine that most of the staff has . <sssss> sometimes it 's just more fun when you 're drinking a slovenian white from a place you 've never heard of and certainly could n't pronounce . <sssss> there are definitely some things on this menu you wo n't see anywhere else . <sssss> you have to be adventurous . <sssss> if you are looking for your usual glass of kj , you 're going to get a scoff and chuckle . <sssss> -lrb- oh , and never ask for a mint julip , either . <sssss> -rrb- as far as the food goes , it 's good . <sssss> their egyptian flatbread pizzas are surprisingly delicious . <sssss> and the fondue was enjoyable . <sssss> but the wine is really where it 's at . <sssss> kazmierz is impressive , unpredictable , and a little bit strange , but boasts the best wine list in old town by far .
?		you know , i 've never been to the black forest mill in the light of day , so my review has nothing to do with its food . <sssss> as far as i know , it 's a bar . <sssss> a bar with weird specials , a general feeling of `` every day is an event ! '' <sssss> and a pretty good dj rotation . <sssss> saturday night here is sort of like ... the real owner went out of town , left his college-age son in charge , and he used the space to throw a party . <sssss> except , it got out of hand right quick and friends of friends of friends started showing up until no one really knew who anyone was . <sssss> the crowd is pretty mixed here . <sssss> but that 's always fun . <sssss> i would n't go unless with a group of friends . <sssss> but i guess that 's part of the problem . <sssss> this place gets stupidly packed , especially around the bar area . <sssss> it can take a while to get a drink . <sssss> like , 15 minutes plus . <sssss> that 's a long time to wait for a hotel-bathroom clear plastic cup . <sssss> the bartenders seemed to be working hard for the most part , but for the volume this place brings in , another body or two behind the counter certainly would n't hurt . <sssss> some bar efficiency , less complex drink specials -lrb- how about no cover , and we just pay for drinks like usual ? <sssss> -rrb- and better quality drinks -lrb- i know it 's a quarter , but it took longer for me to get it than to drink it -rrb- would bump bfm to a solid 4-star . <sssss> i will certainly be back , though . <sssss> highlight : get your german hefe served the way it 's supposed to be : a giant shoe .
?		i am a hummus fiend . <sssss> i have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption . <sssss> i will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip . <sssss> do n't even get me started on baba ghanoush . <sssss> so it 's almost a guarantee that i will like anything that draws upon a mediterranean flavor palate . <sssss> med fresh is no exception . <sssss> it 's technically turkish , but i do n't split hairs when it comes to mediterranean . <sssss> the pitas are fresh and flavorful , the tzatziki is kickin ' and the gyro meat -lrb- beef and chicken -rrb- are always moist and delicious . <sssss> everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goings-on in the sunken kitchen . <sssss> the staff can be a bit terse at times but they 're always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush . <sssss> the platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive , and while i have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion , the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender . <sssss> if you simply ca n't be pressed to make up your mind , go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety . <sssss> the pita sammich special -lrb- # 16 -rrb- is the best bang for your buck on the menu . <sssss> pita , meat , tomato , lettuce , weird pickles and secret sauce . <sssss> served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce . <sssss> salad or fries on the side . <sssss> $ 6.95 . <sssss> oh yeah .
?		holy effin ' eff ! <sssss> best happy hour anywhere in the valley ! <sssss> challenge : if you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at cafe zuzu , i will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from palo verde lounge , the gray-green eggs that time forgot . <sssss> i 'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away . <sssss> two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly ? <sssss> three bucks . <sssss> a surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with -lrb- unassuming -rrb- horseradish mayo and au jus ? <sssss> three bucks . <sssss> two buttery , rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction ? <sssss> three bucks . <sssss> i 'm salivating right now . <sssss> the other two options included the border chili , which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps , and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable . <sssss> standard tomatoes , olives and capers , nowhere near as memorable as il postino or la bocca 's stellar examples . <sssss> since these apps are a bit on the small side , the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks , followed closely by the prime rib dip . <sssss> the artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite -lrb- sooo perfectly buttery , sweet and savory ! <sssss> -rrb- , but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they 're quite small . <sssss> several of our party tried the wine -lrb- chard , pinot , merlot , and i think they 've even got some bubbly -rrb- and had positive things to say . <sssss> while we all had zero interest in trying the beer , since it was just pbr on draft or domestic swill in bottles . <sssss> there were much better options to be had for three bucks , like the specialty cocktails ! <sssss> the waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed . <sssss> best liquor bang for your buck ? <sssss> the hot 'n' dirty , an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of tabasco and three olives . <sssss> they even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside , ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table . <sssss> second most potent potable was the bourbon smash , a whiskey cocktail that 's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep . <sssss> in the words of sammy j , `` it 'll getcha drunk ! '' <sssss> the gin fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails , kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup . <sssss> and for the girlie girls in attendance , the bramble , basil showbiz and cherry limeade will treat ya right ! <sssss> the bramble was heavy on the blackberry , the basil showbiz strawberried out and the cherry limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a sonic limeade . <sssss> superb , one and all . <sssss> i have n't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise , although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour . <sssss> three dollar beer , wine , specialty cocktails and appetizers ? <sssss> a frenzy of -lrb- relatively sophisticated -rrb- gluttony ? <sssss> a mere 15 bucks . <sssss> cafe zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour !
?		i 'm going to have to agree with bonnie on this one . <sssss> the yucca-monkey-time out trifecta creates a vortex at southern and mill that can suck a thrifty drunk into a solid bender without putting a dent in the wallet . <sssss> that said , it 's probably my least favorite bar in this skeevy little triangle . <sssss> it 's just kind of ... there for me . <sssss> first off it 's a tap room with no beer on tap . <sssss> perhaps a more observant patron would have noticed this on their first visit . <sssss> i am not that type of creature . <sssss> probably took me about ... well let 's just say it would take me two hands to count the number of visits , before i finally realized that yucca was either willfully deceptive or were trying to be the hardened , cool baby equivalent of prankster 's gar and brill -lrb- hardy har har -rrb- . <sssss> but i do n't really drink beer on tap that often -lrb- duh -rrb- so this was no great disappointment to me . <sssss> i generally just stick with well spirits , and at least they 've got those in spades . <sssss> however compared to their competition cattycorner -lrb- time out and monkey pants -rrb- , i might as well just save myself disappointment and order a beer because cranberry juice or fizzy cola generally drowns out the taste of any alcohol in the drink . <sssss> a strong drink is an absolute must of a dive bar , and yucca has consistently disappointed in that respect . <sssss> i 've also never had a positive experience with the bartenders , who do n't really give a shit about when they get to you and do n't seem to have any discernable system of serving patrons -lrb- proceeding clockwise until everyone is served , repeat , maybe ? <sssss> -rrb- but i 'm a pretty patient person , and the fact that they have to make change with every order can understandably slow things down . <sssss> live entertainment is the best thing about yucca , with bands playing just about any evening you go without a cover . <sssss> and rockaroke on thursday nights makes this place a must for anyone living in tempe ! <sssss> a live band providing a soundtrack for you to get your best rock star impression on ? <sssss> be still my heart ! <sssss> although you probably would n't want to take a first timer here because all you 're handed is a little sheet of lyrics . <sssss> so you 'd best be performing `` your '' song , because it 's a well known fact that everyone needs at least one solid karaoke song in their repertoire . <sssss> oh , and they have free shuffleboard . <sssss> and i love me some shuffleboard .
?		i enjoy the juicy , succulent taste of murder , but i 've also got friends that would skin me if i took them to a steak house . <sssss> to avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat , it 's always best to choose a place with plenty of greens on the menu . <sssss> pita jungle is the perfect harmony between flesh renders and herbivores . <sssss> and it does n't just have the `` hold the chicken '' type vegg friendly option on the menu , it 's got lentils and shit . <sssss> now , since we 've already established that i live under rocks , you can just go ahead and assume i 've never been to pita jungle . <sssss> what can i say , the grub hunting was good . <sssss> but after my first visit you can bet your skinny little vegan ass i 'll be noshing right next to you on a regular basis . <sssss> the restaurant has apparently expanded twice since it 's been open and it was still hoppin ' last night , with an open , airy feel and interesting artwork decorating the walls . <sssss> we hovered over the seating section booth thingy and were told to go ahead and steal any open seat we liked . <sssss> some may find this annoying and unorganized , but i really like it when they let me do that part of their job for them , so we snagged a table for two right next to the window so i could watch some dog tv , which was showing a tig old biddy sorority girl special based on the number of perky young freshman coming and going in the parking lot . <sssss> -lrb- side note : big old windows are like big screen dog tvs because dogs do n't watch human tv , they keep track of the cats trotting through their territory and bark at the mailman and monitor the comings and goings of the neighborhood through windows . <sssss> at least in my experience . <sssss> i 'll be sitting there glued to the tube and the dogs will be sitting there glued to the window . <sssss> end tangent . <sssss> thanks for your patience . <sssss> -rrb- others have complained about the poor service at this location , but surprise -lrb- sarcasm -rrb- mr. man ends up knowing the waiter assigned to our section , so we were promptly rewarded with menus and drinks . <sssss> not that i would have even noticed the wait since i was agape , trying to take in everything offered on a menu that just would n't quit . <sssss> eventually i grabbed hold of my indecision and narrowed it down to three options , the black bean burger , the lavosh shawarma wrap , or the caribbean salad . <sssss> we agreed that not having hummus simply was n't an option so i went with the shawarma so i could pep it up with some left over hummus , and i really dig lavosh because it reminds me of saltines , which i do n't really like that much , but are scrumptious in flatbread form . <sssss> mr. man decided upon the grilled vegetable salad , because if you 've ever met him , he really needs to watch his boyish figure -lrb- again , sarcasm -rrb- . <sssss> we ordered an extra pita for the hummus , which was overkill and we did n't even end up touching it because the `` small hummus '' ended up being freakin ' huge and the pita was sized to match . <sssss> it was smooth and creamy , and garnished with two of my favorite vegetables -lrb- or whatever an olive technically is -rrb- , cucumbers and kalamata olives ! <sssss> my one gripe about the entire meal was that my chicken was overly dry and a smidgen bland , but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor . <sssss> the side greek salad that came with my wrap was also stupendous , with a hefty amount of feta and a delicious , light vinaigrette to counter that richness . <sssss> mr. man 's grilled vegetable salad was also very well done , with crisp veggies , lots of garlic and an awesome dressing . <sssss> and this delish bounty of fresh , healthy food came to 20 bucks between the two of us and left us with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow . <sssss> i 'll definitely be coming here again , and frequently , so i can get my daily dose of granola crunching hippies , sorority sisters , cooler than thou hipsters and suv driving yuppies with their childrens all in one place . <sssss> unheard of !
?		i just do n't think i 'm much of a brewery gal . <sssss> granted , the beer here blows four peaks out of the water , but i 'd much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew . <sssss> but if beer is your poison of choice , they 've got just about everything . <sssss> the happy hour is kind of weak here though , with like a buck off all drafts . <sssss> thoroughly meh . <sssss> you can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20 + drafts they have on the menu . <sssss> no bud light here though . <sssss> sorry frat chumps . <sssss> they used to have a ton of wine here as well -lrb- like , ages ago -rrb- but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices , none of which were calling my name this last go round . <sssss> their orange blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form . <sssss> almost like a cider with floral notes , a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel . <sssss> -lrb- oh yeah , bitches . <sssss> i just went there . <sssss> -rrb- the perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy . <sssss> their ipa was also pretty decent , but was more bitter than i care for , although it stayed far away from feeling like i was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume . <sssss> solid . <sssss> i thought they had deals on happy hour food -lrb- again , like a buck off -rrb- but last time i went it was no dice . <sssss> at least the food 's reasonably priced . <sssss> tasty rueben , craptastic hummus , crispy quesadilla . <sssss> the acoustics in this place are kind of shitty , so go on an off time when it wo n't be packed , or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo . <sssss> the high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at , but c'est la vie . <sssss> my biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall . <sssss> for a place this small , a big ass mofo tv is just not the way to go .
?		this is not a place for the calorie conscious , so dieters need to swear off this place like the plague . <sssss> even the salads here are smothered in bacon , eggs , cheese and dressing . <sssss> but if you feel like punishing your arteries in the most delicious fashion , i highly recommend matt 's big breakfast . <sssss> i 've heard from just about everyone i know that this place is the bee 's knees , the elephant 's eyebrows , the eel 's hips ... and the buzz was n't wrong . <sssss> this place has some amazing hangover food , so after a night of indulging we arrived at this little diner around noon thirty and had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated . <sssss> the temperature was well over 100 degrees by that point , which is not good on the dehydrated and hung over , but they were kind enough to provide a giant tub of ice water so that waiting diners did n't drop like flies before they could be served . <sssss> two stacks of complimentary foodie magazines were also present for perusal , but my brain did n't feel like thinking yet . <sssss> however , by the time we were done with our dining experience at one twenty , there were empty booths all over the place , so if you 're impatient , go during the last hour they 're open . <sssss> once inside , we sat at the bar , right in the path of the air conditioning vent , with a clear view of the kitchen going ons . <sssss> seeing how i drank my share of water outside i ordered an rc cola -lrb- i did n't even know that brand still existed ! <sssss> -rrb- that came in a can . <sssss> while waiting to order , i did some pretty extreme rubbernecking , judging the deliciousness of every dish that came out of the kitchen or was being munched on by others . <sssss> the menu was modest in size but boasted that they used the freshest organic ingredients whenever possible , and after watching everyone else i was pretty excited when the time came to order . <sssss> i decided to go with my traditional breakfast fare , so i could accurately compare it to other brunch joints : eggs over medium , bacon , hashbrowns and sour dough toast . <sssss> the hog and chick ! <sssss> and . <sssss> it . <sssss> was . <sssss> heaven . <sssss> it 's clear that everything they offered was as fresh as it could possibly be . <sssss> the toast tasted freshly baked , doughy yet crisp , and was delicious dipped in my eggs . <sssss> thick cut peppered bacon melted in my mouth . <sssss> the hashbrowns had to have been made on the premises , because they looked exactly like the ones i make in my own home , greyer than the freezer variety and a bit gelatinous . <sssss> there was even a tiny tub of fresh apricot puree that tasted like there was n't a lick of processed sugar added . <sssss> and everything was drowned to a lovely crisp in butter . <sssss> i only wish it were in tempe instead of phoenix , because i 'd love to try the other menu offerings . <sssss> it 's cheap , delicious , friendly , and some of the best damn hang over food i have ever had .
?		only ever eaten in the bar during happy hour , so this review is not for old school steak house fare with all the fixins . <sssss> that 's cool though because i ca n't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o ' muscle very often anyway . <sssss> i can go years without ending up in a steakhouse and when i do it 's generally a meh experience regardless of how orgasmic people tell me the slice of cow is supposed to be . <sssss> saloon 1889 on the other hand is right up my alley . <sssss> hey , we all have our vices . <sssss> the atmosphere is pure arizona . <sssss> it 's the perfect combination between the slightly nauseating rawhide 's folksy old-zona and the rat pack old school arizona exemplified by durant 's , with maybe a dash of monti 's la casa mediocre tossed in for good measure . <sssss> the bar is a massive antique-looking dark wood relic from another era , with ornate pillars and a huge gilded mirror along one side . <sssss> the bartenders also look like they could whip you up a classic cocktail , the stuff with bitters , or a girly sugar bomb . <sssss> they got skills . <sssss> the happy hour is really where 's it 's at here . <sssss> free sliders , chips and salsa . <sssss> couple bucks off the bar bites , which are substantial meal replacements . <sssss> cheap wine , well , beer , all delivered with a smile .
?		i 'm clearly more of a food city consumer than an aj 's gal , but this place succeeds in making me feel like i not only can , but should splurge on a five dollar loaf of bread to go with the homemade soup i just whipped up for pennies . <sssss> i can deal with the prices because this place is perfect for the occasional uber-specialty ingredients that i ca n't get anywhere else . <sssss> edible flowers for crystallizing , espresso powder for my meat rubs , fancy pants mushrooms , high quality chocolate , duck fat , mangosteens outside of an asian grocer , the works . <sssss> it 's also really great for picking up a couple of super fancy high end shots of liquor in the airplane bottles . <sssss> perfect for a cheapazoid like me that wants the occasional dash of st. germain or chambord but sure as hell is n't going to buy the whole bottle ! <sssss> i 've never encountered any sass here from any of the staff either , even when i show up looking like a barely thrown together trash person .
?		went here on sunday to see an early morning showing of chronicle . <sssss> i had n't been to this theater since it was a united artist -lrb- i think , right ? <sssss> -rrb- back in the day . <sssss> boy , have things changed ! <sssss> after stopping off at the refreshment stand and the espresso bar we sat in our theater -lrb- in the ultraluxe section -rrb- . <sssss> there was only one other person in there besides us so we got our pick of the litter . <sssss> the seats were plush leather recliners and probably the most comfortable seats i 've ever been in . <sssss> i 'd still pick harkins just for the pricing structure but might consider renting out a vip room here someday .
?		this is regarding an experience i had at outback this past saturday . <sssss> we arrived around 6:30 and were told it would be a 30 mins wait . <sssss> we were n't seated until almost an hour later and it only went downhill from there . <sssss> we all ordered salads with our entrees but the entrees came out before the salads . <sssss> what ? <sssss> dessert was comped but the food was still medicore . <sssss> this is why i try to stay away from chain restaurants .
?		the first time i ate here last year i would have given them 5 stars , but tonight they got 1 star for the following reasons . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> it took over an hour to get our appetizer and food . <sssss> our appetizer came out only moments before our food . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> it took another 45 mins to get our check and leave 3 . <sssss> the waiter barely touched our table the only plus is that complaining to the manager is that we got our appetizer comped . <sssss> needless to say we 're never coming back .
?		wow . <sssss> what can i say . <sssss> this experience was pretty bad . <sssss> first -- it 's in a really bad neighborhood . <sssss> you ca n't feel safe at all , and this whole area needs 15 times the police that are walking around . <sssss> price : every time i turned around , someone wanted more money . <sssss> sure , there were displays of canned fruit and elementary school artwork that 's free to see , but anything else , and the carnies want more money . <sssss> it would be a different thing , if they were cheap games with even cheaper prices , but they 're not . <sssss> these are cheap games with spendy prices . <sssss> it 's a groady , dirty , filthy place full of dirty , filthy workers that want me to hand over endless cash for their house-favored games . <sssss> i 'm proud to be an arizona-born native , although i 'm stunned that our politicians continue to declare that this annual event is a benefit to the pride of the state of arizona . <sssss> did i mention that they want money the instant you park your car ? <sssss> they also want money when you go in , they want money for ride tickets , and they want money for food -- am i leaving something out ? <sssss> i would expect that they will start charging to use the clean bathrooms that have n't been installed yet . <sssss> please avoid this place , save your money , and do n't feel like you 're missing anything . <sssss> p.s. . <sssss> if you 're going to a concert -- they will let you see it , once you 've paid to get inside the park . <sssss> it will be in the coliseum where the seats were designed for 12-year-old girls . <sssss> please do n't expect that the seating was designed for actual , american men like john wayne , who i heard was 6 ' 4 '' . <sssss> he would 've never fit . <sssss> i 'm also convinced that they wo n't spend the effort to correct this horrendously un-american flaw , and yet they will continue to expect your endless supply of $ $ $ money $ $ $ . <sssss> enjoy !
?		the 3-stars are because the prices detracted from the taste of the food . <sssss> i could n't believe how much they expected from the little portions that they served . <sssss> this is definitely not a family or college student place . <sssss> at these prices , this place should be in scottsdale . <sssss> service : they are what you 'd expect from a service establishment . <sssss> the wait staff is working , so do n't expect pleasant conversation or friendly banter . <sssss> this is a business . <sssss> price : where else can you pay $ 8 for a 2-taco meal ? <sssss> and do you want a drink with that -- because it will cost even more ... taste : average . <sssss> it 's mexican food from a mexican restaurant , so it 's exactly what you 'd expect . <sssss> please do n't expect something spectacular . <sssss> the prices for stunning little portions will definitely keep me from coming back . <sssss> i ordered my food from the cash register , and could n't believe that they thought the portions for my money were ok . <sssss> i could 've easily eaten two portions for a lunch portion , and yet it would 've been $ 16 . <sssss> do n't expect college-student prices from this scottsdale-type price list , and do n't expect college-student portions from this meager-portion list . <sssss> also , do n't think that their idea of a single-portion would feed an american male ... i heard that john wayne was 6 ' 4 '' tall , and i 'm not that big . <sssss> since i was n't satisfied , i 'm sure he 'd never be satisfied by what they wanted to charge for a single , american-man 's portion . <sssss> so sad .
?		great service , great food , and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant . <sssss> you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable . <sssss> local breeze made it tolerable and i do n't think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience . <sssss> they had fans , a swamp cooler , and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture . <sssss> we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for . <sssss> the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees . <sssss> their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing . <sssss> ok selection of beers , certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite , kiltlifter , to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich . <sssss> my girlfirned -lrb- rachel o. -rrb- went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish . <sssss> it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it . <sssss> the coca cola ham was huge and both of us only managed to eat half of it . <sssss> leftovers are always good . <sssss> service was spot on , and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before . <sssss> get over it , it 's no longer pallete , move on , and enjoy the local breeze .
?		chihuly chihuly chihuly . <sssss> visited dbg for the first time for the chihuly event `` agave on the rocks '' and for 75 a person the event was done beautifully . <sssss> well worth it . <sssss> drinks were good , food was mediocre , but the atmosphere is what made the event . <sssss> not too yuppy but still with plenty of trendy . <sssss> the art is spectacular and it looks like the desert took acid and smoked a couple of joints . <sssss> the area is large with lots to explore . <sssss> def a must-see .
?		i 've been in here twice , hoping to pick up a new toy , treat , or accessory for my prized pooch , but i never seem to leave with anything . <sssss> i find the collars and leashes to be nothing more than ordinary , and if they happen to have something glitzy , it 's marked up beyond belief . <sssss> as are most of their treats and toys . <sssss> i can purchase most of what they sell here at ryans pet supply for half the price . <sssss> they do have a large selection of natural and organic and all that `` non-processed '' healthy food/snacks for your dog , but i tried giving kinsey some all natural dog treats and she threw them up two minutes later . <sssss> so much for trying to be trendy and organic . <sssss> i 'm assuming it 's gay-owned because of the assortment of rainbow stickers on the door , so i 'll give them cool points for that . <sssss> but i just ca n't get over how overpriced everything is , and what little they actually have to offer .
?		finally got around to checking out this place for lunch time on my day off - they close early so i rarely get to make it to these hip sandwich spots . <sssss> . <sssss> despite the tiny menu of items , my friend and i managed to find two sandwhiches that sounded delicious . <sssss> not sure what to expect for $ 8 , i ordered the tuna and she got the tomato and mozzarella . <sssss> we also picked up the tea/lemonade which brought us up to a little over $ 11 each . <sssss> normally my cheap ass does not spend more than $ 5 for lunch -lrb- subway , anyone ? <sssss> -rrb- so my expectations were high from the second my card was swiped . <sssss> the sandwiches were made quickly and came packed up to go in a very cute bag . <sssss> we grabbed a table outside and dug in . <sssss> the bread that they oven bake is delicious and the sandwich was surprisingly big and filling . <sssss> the tuna was made without mayo -lrb- which i prefer -rrb- and the tomato/mozzarella was fresh , juicy , and delicious . <sssss> the tea was refreshing and tart , just how i like it . <sssss> for $ 8 , i 'd expect at least a bag of kettle chips to go on the side , or something . <sssss> i find it weird to eat a sandwich without a side , especially without some salt and vinegar chips . <sssss> this place probably gets quite crowded during the break of lunch , but we went it was n't too bad at 1:30 pm . <sssss> more seating would be nice , and hopefully they get some misters going for summer lunch patrons cuz you 're right in the sun .
?		i 'm not a vegan or a vegetarian , i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium-rare steak . <sssss> and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am . <sssss> i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat , because i think it 's just psychologically strange . <sssss> but ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago , i 've had nearly everything on the menu . <sssss> and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything . <sssss> my favorites : number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger . <sssss> i could eat these everyday . <sssss> it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat , but do n't let it freak you out . <sssss> it also comes with hummus , bright orange nacho cheese , and chipotle sauce . <sssss> this burger is spiiiccyyyy so beware . <sssss> their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned . <sssss> also love their soy ice cream treats , soy-namis , my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch . <sssss> their lime-ade , lemon-ade , and teas are always fresh and delicious . <sssss> i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant -lrb- yummmm -rrb- and tomatos . <sssss> their pita chips and hummus are to die for . <sssss> they 're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus . <sssss> and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing . <sssss> green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head .
?		first time in this place - extremely cute , cozy , and full of delicious treats . <sssss> i wish i had more time to look around and explore but i was starving and my sandwich was ready within minutes . <sssss> i went with the nooner - the sandwich you can customize to your liking . <sssss> which is great because i 'm a very picky eater when it comes to sandwiches - know what flavor combinations i like and i despise mayo , lettuce , and tomato on my sandwiches which is typical for most places to offer standard . <sssss> but not at the duck , you order it exactly how you want it ! <sssss> i went for the smoked turkey on dark rye , with sprouts , russian mustard , peppercinis , and the jalepeno havarti . <sssss> i also ordered up a side of potato salad and was tempted to buy some cookies but i withheld . <sssss> the sandwiches come with a pickle spear as well . <sssss> i love that this place has so many choices to choose from - it was hard to just pick one - which means i 'll have to come back and try other things . <sssss> i looked at their take home menu and they 're open at 7 and close at 9 and serve breakfast stuff all day . <sssss> their coffee smelled delicious as well . <sssss> back to the sandwich - delicious ! <sssss> the mustard was sooo good and must have had wasabi in it because i could feel it burn in my nose . <sssss> the bread was soft and the turkey was tasty . <sssss> the potato salad sucked , it had a strange taste to it - like it was watery or something . <sssss> the pickle was not very good either . <sssss> if this review were just for the sandwich it would be four stars . <sssss> the lackluster potato salad and pickle are n't enough to stop me from coming back to the duck to savor the wide variety of other treats this place has to offer , including lots of wine and beer .
?		best gyros in phoenix . <sssss> for 8 bucks , you get a huge gyros sandwich filled with tasty tzatziki , onions and tomatos on the softest pita bread i 've ever had , along with a huge side of crispy seasoned fries and a soft drink with free refils . <sssss> my friend got the vegetarian falafel sandwich combo which they let her customize and get dolmadas and spanikopita as her sides . <sssss> along with a delicious greek salad . <sssss> the falafel was n't dry and too crunchy , they were soft and perfectly crisp little morsels of greek deliciousness . <sssss> take my word . <sssss> i 'm from chicago and grew up with a greek family . <sssss> i know my gyros .
?		stopped by this funky looking place around 6pm on a weeknight and no wait . <sssss> ive wanted to stop here many times before but have avoided the twistingly long lines i see when i pass this place around lunch time . <sssss> the people inside were very friendly and although quite a bit stuffy and small inside , i could dig it . <sssss> they have a large enough outdoor area with misters and fans and a pick up window to get your food at . <sssss> my friend and i each got the 3 tacos and a fruit slushie . <sssss> i chose pear , and she chose raspberry guava . <sssss> both were delicious and refreshing . <sssss> the sign outside said `` flavor of the day - strawberry margarita '' , and i was a little excited that they had margaritas but alas - no liquor license , so no cool , crisp , refreshing corona to wash down my tacos with either . <sssss> the tacos are good size each , with plenty of delicious choices of meats/fillers to choose from . <sssss> we both picked red beef , chicken , bean and cheese , and carne asada . <sssss> the red beef was my favorite , with the carne asada a close second . <sssss> skip the chicken , it tasted rather bland . <sssss> the cabage was delicious and crisp and nice substitute for lettuce . <sssss> each of our orders came with 3 salsas and 3 limes , absolutely essential for taco eating . <sssss> i really enjoy two hippie 's burgers and love their tacos . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back .
?		this place is probably as authentic as you can get , i heard the owners are syrian and they are serious about their food . <sssss> the owner was bitching to me about the ridiculous charges on his aps bill while i was waiting for my gyros . <sssss> he also gave me a tea in a glass while i waited plus an iced tea to go . <sssss> very friendly and outgoing . <sssss> the place is cute inside , small but looks like it would hold more than you think . <sssss> i love small businesses like this - it makes me feel better knowing my money is going to support a family owned small business rather than a sweatshop of a chain restaurant . <sssss> i ordered the gyros and damn that thing came loaded , so i asked for an extra pita to make a second sandwich for lunch tomorrow . <sssss> the pita was fried i think , it was crispy soft and hot and the gyros was some of the best i 've ever had . <sssss> not too dry and not too tenderly juicy . <sssss> the tzatki sauce was superb but the sandwich could have done without the onions or tomatoes they load on it -lrb- easy to pick off -rrb- . <sssss> seeing as how i work next to this place , i 'm sure i 'll be back to try more of their greek delights .
?		i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the dressing-drenched paper that held my very first , and surely not last , lucky boy international burger . <sssss> crispy bun , tons of dressing , fresh lettuce , tomatoes , pickles and onions , and a perfectly tender , smokey burger . <sssss> thick , perfectly salted , crunchy on the outside and soft and burning hot on the inside fries . <sssss> thick and deliciously sweet chocolate and peanut butter shake . <sssss> gone . <sssss> in less than 5 minutes . <sssss> place closes early , so unfortunately there will be no drunk trips through the dangerously narrow drive thru .
?		delicious !!! <sssss> little pricey but worth it !
?		okay i gave it another try for a friends birthday and i actually had a blast ! <sssss> it was a sunday and we had a table but it was a really good time . <sssss> i 'd go again with a group of friends : -rrb-
?		love the lettuce wraps , there awesome ! <sssss> the chicken lo mein is really good as well and a lil shot of dessert at the end of the meal is perfection ! <sssss> not to expensive good food !
?		i went here tonight with my dad and it was cute ! <sssss> we had a pretzel for an appetizer and it was really good but little small . <sssss> we both had the salmon and it was very good ! <sssss> reasonably priced . <sssss> . <sssss> the sandwiches looked awesome . <sssss> . <sssss> i 'd try it again : -rrb-
?		it was good ... but thats about it ... was n't great or outstanding ... did n't wow me . <sssss> . <sssss> for the prices i want wow : -rrb-
?		i 'm not quite understanding these 5 star reviews ... maybe they are friends with the manager or owner . <sssss> it 's not that i think this is a poor experience . <sssss> i agree with most of the comments : `` unpretentious '' `` comfortable '' `` great ambiance '' . <sssss> my visit was all those things -- pleasantly surprising a restaurant found in a hotel . <sssss> the menu is interesting and even innovative ; not many nuevo-mexican establishments serve chilaquiles on the menu . <sssss> the mini tacos were good , with a veggie option , carne asada or cochinita pibill . <sssss> the carne asada was grizzly -lrb- and remember , this is a mini taco - so to have all three bites to be grizzly was a disappointment . <sssss> -rrb- conversely , the cochinta was flavorful -lrb- but it was a little greasy -rrb- -rrb- -- but man - it was delish ! <sssss> i ordered a side of guacamole - yuck . <sssss> but i also ordered a side of french fries -lrb- do n't ask what spurred that combination -rrb- , which i loved . <sssss> 5 stars for the french fries which came along with an aoili chili dipping sauce . <sssss> the gallo blanco cafe deserves your attention and hopefully they 'll just continue to tweak the food a bit because the place has potential . <sssss> -lrb- note : i went for lunch , so i 'm not sure what the bar atmosphere or happy hour/dinner is like . <sssss> -rrb-
?		maybe the management is trying to conserve their carbon footprint - it sure was dark in there . <sssss> ahhh - but i 'm burying the lead . <sssss> i 'm a fan . <sssss> good food that combines interesting flavors - like their apricot bbq chicken sandwich . <sssss> i usually order the same thing -- a shaved chicken pita sandwich -lrb- with feta , olives -rrb- . <sssss> i 've also tried the crepes and they were yummy - but i feel like the sauce could have been richer , thicker and tastier . <sssss> but do n't let that deter you -- it was still great . <sssss> the service was good , but i thought the space was a little crammed -lrb- ... if you read any of my other reviews - i do n't like to feel crowded -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm giving the stars to different menu options . <sssss> support your local , stand-alone , restaurants in central phoenix !
?		true food kitchen has good and healthy food . <sssss> it 's definitely not a place to go if you want a some `` comfort '' -- let 's say ... french fries with your low-fat turkey burger . <sssss> i ordered a cup of miso soup -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- and hummus as my main course -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- . <sssss> both were fantastic . <sssss> my husband ordered chicken sausage bolagnese -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- , which he loved . <sssss> for desert , we shared an apple-cranberry crisp with dairy-free maple-flavored ice cream -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . <sssss> we were both pleasantly full and happy after our meal . <sssss> they have a series of specialty drinks which the waiter pitched to us fervently with words like `` you ca n't get this anywhere else in the world . <sssss> . '' <sssss> ross tried `` andy 's elixer `` and enjoyed it , but i was not impressed and thought it was a waste of $ 5 bucks . <sssss> we would visit again , but i imagine this is n't someplace that would elicit an : `` i have a craving for true foods kitchen '' statement . <sssss> from my husband or i.
?		i do n't get it . <sssss> why the fuss or the great reviews ? <sssss> i 've gone to various locations - phoenix , tempe , shea blvd. . <sssss> i do n't understand why people will wait 30-45 minutes to eat here ? <sssss> the service is n't bad , the atmosphere is nice . <sssss> but honestly , the food is n't that great -lrb- imho -rrb- . <sssss> i 've tried the turkey sub , the chicken fiesta salad , the italian sausage sub , the margarita pizza and others ... nothing has impressed me . <sssss> i wonder if people love this place because they serve cheesecake factory-like servings -lrb- i 've always had to take my food home in a doggy-bag -rrb- . <sssss> it 's about as faux pizza and italian food as you can get . <sssss> do n't get sucked into the crowd-source mentality of friends raving about this place . <sssss> no way am i a fan of the food . <sssss> period .
?		it 's ok . <sssss> not great . <sssss> but ok . <sssss> especially if you live in the south mountain area where we do n't have many selections of restaurants to choose from . <sssss> my favorite is the honey seared chicken . <sssss> they also have a great kids menu if you have adventurous eaters like my 11 year old son . <sssss> the service is ... um ... efficient ... yeah ... efficient ... but not especially friendly . <sssss> they do have an outdoor patio which is a nice addition in the fall .
?		i 'm only half asian so i 'm not sure if my opinion counts . <sssss> tho the price is cheap and the service is lightning fast the food does not stack up . <sssss> yet the place was packed . <sssss> there was enough oil on my food for me to deep fry my thanksgiving turkey , luckily it was not peanut oil otherwise i would have ask for a to go box .
?		had a hard time finding this place at night but its definitely worth the drive . <sssss> parking is also slim but valet is available . <sssss> this small place comes with excellent customer service and most of all good ice cream !!! <sssss> will be back for more vietnamese coffee and butter pecan goodness ...
?		this place is a must for the true buffalo -lrb- the city -rrb- style hotdog lover , plain simple , yet satisfying . <sssss> but be prepared , this place does not do any other transaction besides hard earned cash !! <sssss> btw there is an bofa atm machine a stone thow away .
?		i want to like this place . <sssss> i really do . <sssss> it 's near by , it 's local , it 's efficient , and it 's reasonably priced and seems to be a holdover against the big chain burger guys . <sssss> it 's just not that great . <sssss> while the fries were thicker cut - several were burned . <sssss> my burger 's most prominent taste was charcoal , and i 'm not talking about that delicious char grilled taste - i mean nasty petroleum tasting burned charcoal . <sssss> i may go back again , but with significantly lowered expectations .
?		good . <sssss> cheap . <sssss> tasty . <sssss> 24/7 . <sssss> drive through . <sssss> that sums this place up . <sssss> highlights : their carnitas platter comes in a styrofoam plate with beans , rice , and two giant tortillas , weighs quite literally 2 lbs , and is enough to put two people to sleep for a little more than 7 dollars . <sssss> now that 's bang for your buck . <sssss> taquitos plate - at 4.50 - also good . <sssss> burritos of all sorts but stay away from the fish . <sssss> carnitas is probably the best . <sssss> asada is a little gristly but good . <sssss> barbacoa not bad . <sssss> breakfast is quite tasty too . <sssss> asada fries will put you down for the count . <sssss> but you 're not paying for a glamorous atmosphere - or heat on a cold day , so do n't expect it . <sssss> i 'd recommend it for a late nights , when you 're really hungry
?		i 'd recommend this place highly for two situations : 1 . <sssss> -rrb- you are on the west side of town and you want some reasonably priced grub , 2 . <sssss> -rrb- you 've never had vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a non-intimidating environment . <sssss> for those two things , pa is awesome ! <sssss> nice people , decent food , and a very friendly environment . <sssss> but their food does n't stack up to the central phoenix standard bearers . <sssss> i suppose that their score is artificially low because of the category they are competing in . <sssss> were they the only game in town , i suspect i would have rated them much higher - just to get my hands on a bahn mi every now and again .
?		i only give five stars to places that i have been multiple times and been consistently impressed by both the products and the service . <sssss> it has to be a place that i would absolutely recommend to anyone , any time . <sssss> it has to be , dollar for dollar , a better overall experience . <sssss> mi cocina , mi pais -lrb- their name before some ridiculous chain bearing the same name threatened a law suit -rrb- unquestionably fits the bill , and was my regular restaurant during grad school . <sssss> i have brought several people to dinner here only to have them leave in gushing awe . <sssss> the food and service are simply soulful . <sssss> it 's a challenge to find something that i did n't like there , but i found they are especially good at the slow cooking stuff - stews and the like . <sssss> the highlight for me is their sanduche de puerco - a slow cooked pork sandwich served with their incredible and noteworthy aji -lrb- a salsa so flavorful and addictive that it deserves a special place of honor -rrb- . <sssss> mi cocina , mi pais is the sort of place that happens when owners take pride in their food and see their products as a reflection of themselves and their home . <sssss> recommended .
?		i like simple places . <sssss> the downfall of many restaurants -lrb- imho -rrb- is attempting to do too much . <sssss> rather than stick to what they can excel at , many owners try to extend themselves into arenas where they should not go . <sssss> this strategy is usually driven by incremental revenue or to appeal to new demographics . <sssss> what usually results is a culinary travesty that leaves everyone unsatisfied and ultimately another statistic in the world of failed businesses . <sssss> thmmb is not that sort of place , and i suspect , that it is the sort of joint that has real staying power . <sssss> the reason : thmmb does one thing - burgers , and it does it with aplomb . <sssss> i get one thing when i come here - the green chili cheese burger combo for $ 5 . <sssss> good burger , good price point . <sssss> nuff said .
?		worst service i 've had in a long time . <sssss> the waitress was snotty and literally could n't do the basic math necessary for me to pay my bill -lrb- gave her a $ 20 bill and she sat there like ` um , 20 minus 12.44 is ... uh ... uh ... ' -rrb- . <sssss> pho broth was overly salty . <sssss> it took more than ten minutes to get my bill and i had to go up and ask for it . <sssss> i will never , ever , go back .
?		i went to bosa donuts around 6 am on friday . <sssss> they had a good selection , and quite a lot of everything that they had . <sssss> however other reviewers talked a lot about hoe fresh the doughnuts were and how good they were . <sssss> i got 4 doughnuts and while none of them were stale they definitely were n't fresh . <sssss> they had to be a least several hours old . <sssss> they were n't hot or light like fresh doughnuts tend to be . <sssss> however , they all tasted really well , so i 'll definitely be back , but i wo n't be hoping for hot fresh doughnuts . <sssss> : -rrb-
?		the best pho in phx , hands down ! <sssss> the owners are super nice and totally amenable to subsitutions and changes . <sssss> i love it !
?		if original hamburger works became a trendy chain with modern decor , it would be smashburger . <sssss> the burgers , fries and shoestring onions are tasty . <sssss> for some reason the place smells like raw sewage however . <sssss> i 'm not sure what that is all about . <sssss> good burger place . <sssss> but you can get the exact same thing at locally owned original hamburger works on thomas .
?		if you enjoy being crunched in a tiny space with middle aged wannabe rich women while screaming immigrant babies run rampant through the store this place is for you .
?		excellent food . <sssss> good atmosphere . <sssss> do n't let the outside fool you , the prime is quite possibly the best chinese food in the state .
?		bookman 's is kept up much better than any other used book store i know . <sssss> they have a nice selection of used electronics as well .
?		it is what it is - very good fast food mexican restaurant in south phoenix .
?		best sushi ever ! <sssss> great happy hour too . <sssss> 3-6 and 8-close they have $ 5 rolls and cheap drinks . <sssss> they have some unique sushi . <sssss> my favorite is the heart attack ! <sssss> the environment is really nice too . <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed by trying this one !!!
?		this is a perfect place to make a quick stop on your way home to grab some milk , eggs , produce or other basic needs . <sssss> it is a little more pricy than a chain grocery store of course , but you are supporting local farms and businesses when shopping here which is worth the extra buck . <sssss> some fun things you can find here that is hard to find in other stores is kombucha , dr hummus and they even have a nice little coffee shop inside the store as well .
?		i have to preface that every time i 've visited this location it has been after midnight and i might have been pretty intoxicated . <sssss> with that said , yummy yummy drunken food ! <sssss> i love that they are open after the bars close . <sssss> i love to get a side of hot sauce to dip my sandwich in . <sssss> nice tool to soak up the alcohol .
?		this place is heavenly !!! <sssss> i have dreams about it on a regular basis . <sssss> the cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors . <sssss> tasty !
?		the reviews for here are spot on . <sssss> the food was okay . <sssss> yummy margaritas ! <sssss> okay salsa , but not great . <sssss> overcooked chips . <sssss> but considering we live in phoenix there is no need to waste your time eating here . <sssss> there are hundreds of better mexican food restaurants that you do n't have to wait to be seated and way better priced .
?		if you 're not in a rush this place is great ! <sssss> i went for breakfast and it was really good . <sssss> the menu is pretty unique . <sssss> there are tons of things i still want to try ! <sssss> but it took forever for them to come and take our order . <sssss> the place was n't really packed either which was weird . <sssss> but once the food came it was well worth it . <sssss> and they were really sweet about taking forever and even gave us some free fruit .
?		great pizza and the best red velvet cake i 've ever had !
?		let me start off by saying , this place is awesome !!!! <sssss> i had the filet medium rare and it was one of the best filets i 've had . <sssss> the lobster mashed potatoes are a must . <sssss> it was my favorite part of the meal . <sssss> huge chunks of lobster and creamy mashed potatoes . <sssss> the creme corn was good as well , but i would go there just for the lobster mashed potatoes . <sssss> if you do n't try the lobster mashed potatoes , you are missing out on the entire experience of mastro 's . <sssss> as for dessert , the warm butter cake is amazing . <sssss> i would recommend this or the creme brulee . <sssss> warning , you will most likely feel like your stomach is about to explode when leaving there . <sssss> on a last note , get the lobster mashed potatoes .
?		was n't super impressed . <sssss> the seafood was alright , but for the price i would expect it to be amazing . <sssss> would n't ever come back .
?		i like this bww . <sssss> i 've had great service every time i have been here . <sssss> the boneless wings are great and their selection of bear on tap is great . <sssss> come during happy hour and you can get a large beer for the price of a small . <sssss> yes , they might be more pricey than wing stop , but personally i think their wings are better , they have a better selection of sauces , and the ambiance is much better .
?		i 've been to this olive garden quite a few times , dining in and to-go . <sssss> overall , the food is on par with other olive gardens and the service is good . <sssss> i would recommend this place if you are in the mood for olive garden . <sssss> my favs are the tour of italy , seafood alfredo , and tiramisu .
?		okay , i said i was n't going to do this but i could n't resist . <sssss> omg !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> jalapeno avocado and mayan chocolate . <sssss> there are no words ...
?		the first time i ate here was at their friends and family pre-opening event . <sssss> now , in the interest of full disclosure , i was neither friends nor family at that point -lrb- i was discussing a book event with wendy -rrb- , though in typical tribal fashion i was adopted by the borensteins and made mischpucha -lrb- translate : family for the non-yiddish speaking and goyem -rrb- . <sssss> anyway , since that evening i 've been there six or eight times . <sssss> it 's always terrific . <sssss> though i always order a lean corned beef on rye , i 've had a number of things with family and friends . <sssss> everything has been fantastic - the traditional comfort food i ate since emerging from the womb . <sssss> though i will caution about the matzo ball soup ; it has a sweetness i do n't care for . <sssss> we 've had blintzes , latkes , fish , knishes ... the list is longer but that 's all i can think of off the top of my head . <sssss> everything has been terrific . <sssss> same with the service . <sssss> i 've been treated very well every time i 've been there . <sssss> for good or ill there is now a chompie 's closer to my house . <sssss> the jury is still out on which it is , i mean , nobody ever said a `` latke a day keeps the doctor away . '' <sssss> you know what i 'm sayin ' ...
?		underwhelming - that 's the only word for it . <sssss> i was really sad about that , too . <sssss> i went with great expectations of an `` old school '' evening out . <sssss> the decor did n't disappoint . <sssss> the dark , heavy furnishings work well in the dim lighting . <sssss> the nail-head accented upholstery looks right at home against the velvet flowered wallpaper . <sssss> the host wears a tux and the waiters were similarly attired . <sssss> the service was , for the most part , excellent , though they did have a hard time keeping up with us on the water . <sssss> but they figured it out . <sssss> really it was the food that i 'm giving 3.5 stars . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> but for those prices in that atmosphere with their reputation and history ... well , good just does n't cut it . <sssss> i could have had good in a couple of dozen places for half the price . <sssss> for example , i had salmon . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> it came with mashed potatoes that were reputed to be garlicky , and a salad that was mixed greens , three croutons and half a bottle of dressing . <sssss> it cost about $ 30 . <sssss> the thing is , i had an equally good piece of salmon recently at arcadia farms for around $ 12 or $ 13 . <sssss> we shared a fruit crisp for dessert and it was the same thing . <sssss> we paid $ 10 for a scoop of ice cream , a bowl of granola and a hint of apples and peaches . <sssss> we could have gone up the street a block to fez and had a much better dessert for less . <sssss> so i guess what i 'd say about durant 's is this : go somewhere else - twice .
?		cool , italian pizza place . <sssss> my husband loves the pizza here . <sssss> the service is always 5 star . <sssss> i wish they had more food choices , esp better salads .
?		the service was good . <sssss> they have some specials for happy hour . <sssss> overall though the quality of the food compared with price was lacking . <sssss> nice , authentic feeling mom and pop place though .
?		awesome concept . <sssss> upscale ambiance . <sssss> unique gourmet entrees . <sssss> very expensive . <sssss> do n't go here if you are really hungry . <sssss> the portions are small and pricey . <sssss> come here for good customer service and food that you ca n't get at the chain restaurants . <sssss> be prepared for a huge bill at the end . <sssss> -lrb- maybe during happy hour there are some deals though . <sssss> -rrb-
?		i 'm going to be honest , i 'll probably be a fan of any buffet . <sssss> i like customizing my salad -lrb- where would i be able to order one with hard boiled eggs , corn , bell peppers and one cucumber slice ? <sssss> -rrb- and getting a random assortment of hot food . <sssss> i love the variety a buffet offers , and if i 'm hungry enough , it 's a great value . <sssss> i wo n't kid myself that this is a healthier option than other buffets , because did i mention i smother the above salad in ranch ? <sssss> and that the assortment of hot food is macaroni , pizza , corn bread and a cookie ? <sssss> the only complaint i 've had at this particular location is that we must have arrived at the very end of their dinner rush ... the `` please wait to be seated '' sign was still up , but nobody had any intention of seating us . <sssss> or acknowledging our questions and pleas for help . <sssss> finally , a manager said that they could switch to `` seat yourselves '' dining and someone flipped the sign .
?		postino 's is a great place for a date or evening out with friends . <sssss> the arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio ... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather . <sssss> i have to admit , i have n't tried very much from the menu . <sssss> every time i come , the rest of the table and i order bruschetta to share and some wine . <sssss> although i 'm sure the rest of the food is great , i really do recommend bruschetta . <sssss> there are 12 different varieties to choose from , with everything from the classic tomato , mozzarella and basil to brie with apple slices to prosciutto . <sssss> every single one is delicious . <sssss> they work well for one order for two people , so order accordingly . <sssss> for our group of 4 , we got 2 orders . <sssss> with four varieties each , we got to try 8 of the 12 available . <sssss> it was easiest to say that we 'd try one of everything , with the exception of the ones that had an ingredient someone at the table would prefer to skip . <sssss> we also split a bottle of wine , which complimented the meal very well . <sssss> our server was knowledgeable enough to recommend a bottle based on what we were in the mood for , and he really hit the mark . <sssss> we were amused that the woman whose job it was to fill water glasses would come around so often that the glass never got below half empty . <sssss> it was almost too much , but hey , we stayed well hydrated . <sssss> the atmosphere is very `` cool '' with dim lighting , modern decor , and a definite wine theme throughout . <sssss> service has been excellent each time i 've dined here . <sssss> those are perks for sure , but the bruschetta would keep me coming back anyway ! <sssss> check out any of the postino 's that may be near you ! <sssss> if you go in on monday or tuesday after 8 , their date night special is a bruschetta platter and a bottle of wine for $ 20 . <sssss> ca n't beat that ! <sssss> keep in mind that postino arcadia is valet parking only ; -rrb-
?		i had never heard of crackers until i visited , and i did n't realize it was a chain until just now ! <sssss> i have been seriously missing out . <sssss> fiance and i stopped by for lunch , having been called in from the street by the signage . <sssss> my first impression was that the cafe felt very classy . <sssss> i ordered hot tea as part of a plan to stave off an oncoming cold -lrb- did n't work -rrb- and was presented several options in a box . <sssss> nice . <sssss> opting for the lunch menu , i chose a roast beef , tomato , avocado melt -lrb- not what it was called on the menu , but the name has slipped my mind -rrb- . <sssss> it came with a side salad and a pickle spear . <sssss> i absolutely loved that sandwich . <sssss> hot , it was an a + . <sssss> leftover for lunch later , it was a solid b + still , and i did n't even warm it up . <sssss> i 'd go back for that sandwich alone .
?		i 'm always a fan of mimis . <sssss> breakfast , lunch , dinner ... it 's all good . <sssss> my old go-to was the french dip with au jus , which had such tender beef . <sssss> more recently i have expanded my palette , and i also come more often for breakfast . <sssss> the california avocado blt omelette is mouth-watering -lrb- minus the bacon -rrb- . <sssss> get the potatoes fried with onions and peppers for an extra burst of flavor ! <sssss> for lighter appetites , the blueberry muffins ca n't be beat . <sssss> there 's also a seasonal flavor -lrb- pumpkin ? <sssss> red velvet ? <sssss> -rrb- that 's usually pretty fantastic , so ask your server ! <sssss> for brunch , try a mimosa or sparkling wine flight . <sssss> the coffee is also pretty good , though i 'd be even happier with some flavored creamers . <sssss> mimis has something for everyone !
?		both times i 've been to the sushi room so far , was with a groupon . <sssss> due to groupon rules , any happy hour items we ordered did n't apply to our available balance , but it looked like some good deals . <sssss> i 'd probably only return if it were happy hour prices -lrb- or another groupon ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the food was very good . <sssss> the kappa rolls were amazing , but everything we tried was good . <sssss> the atmosphere would have been just fine with maybe 20 % fewer tables . <sssss> it felt too crowded , and i literally knocked into two people trying to get out of the restaurant . <sssss> there were no main aisles to walk down , one must squeeze between other customers . <sssss> the area at the front door is so small , that when you open the door , you must stop in the doorway because the hostess is * right there * and wait to be seated . <sssss> the first time i went , the service was fine . <sssss> nothing to write home about , but nothing awful . <sssss> the second time , i took some issue with our server . <sssss> she was clearly busy , but in so much of a rush , she made the process harder on everyone . <sssss> as she tried to explain different rolls or menu items , she spoke so quickly that i rarely understood what she actually said . <sssss> she 'd walk away and our table would look at each other hoping someone could translate , all feeling a bit dumbstruck . <sssss> we saw the same expression on the neighboring tables faces too ! <sssss> while i know i could have asked for a drink at any time , she never bothered to offer one or ask if we 'd like one . <sssss> i did n't think about it until the food came , so by then i decided water was fine . <sssss> another waitress who helped her carry plates out had a much friendlier demeanor . <sssss> our server just rubbed me the wrong way . <sssss> prices and food are comparable to other sushi restaurants , but between the service and cramped dining area , the sushi room does not top my list ... it 's `` ok '' .
?		native new yorker knows their wings ! <sssss> i would only come here for the wings , and the wings are why i come here . <sssss> that , and it 's a decent place to sit and hang out with some friends , and maybe watch a game -lrb- or 7 -rrb- . <sssss> the best part about the wings are all the flavor options . <sssss> you do n't have to get full orders of one flavor , so i tend to mix and match . <sssss> i love the pineapple teriyaki and honey bbq , and the asian garlic ones are pretty good added in for interest . <sssss> i 'm sure the spicy varieties are great , but unfortunately , i am a wimp . <sssss> the celery sticks are even good , none of that not-yet-ripe , inch-long , only-2-pieces business . <sssss> i have n't tried any of the other food ... i have n't felt the need to do so yet . <sssss> there 's a patio if the weather permits . <sssss> it has its own bar and some tvs , so it 's nice if you 're there for the sports . <sssss> inside , there are more than enough tvs to scream at . <sssss> i should n't have written this review so early , i 'm going to be daydreaming about chicken wings all day !
?		i am a fan of amazing noodles and fun fusion dishes , so when a friend of mine told me about this place being his favorite joint and invited me to go , i jumped on it like white on rice . <sssss> noodles ranch is located in the bashas complex on thomas and scottsdale rd. next to lolo 's ! <sssss> twofer ! <sssss> i am so glad i can come to one place to get my foodie on hardcore . <sssss> upon walking up , nothing much to see , there are basic booths and tables with a casual eastern theme going on . <sssss> we sat in a booth and the owner said hello upon recognizing my friend from his innumerable visits there . <sssss> i looked at the menu and gawked at the prices that are easy on the wallet ... i then asked my buddy what he recommends . <sssss> i like everything vietnamese , so it 's a tough call for me to choose . <sssss> i was in the mood for a veggie dish of some sort . <sssss> he said the goi ga was fantastic -- a cool , zesty chicken salad : shredded white meat with cabbage , carrot , mint , chopped peanut and chili lime dressing . <sssss> i could n't even look at anything else . <sssss> done . <sssss> ordered . <sssss> my buddy ordered the bun thet nuong : grilled garlic pork and vermicelli along with veggies . <sssss> they both arrived quickly . <sssss> i could eat this salad every day . <sssss> there is nothing wrong with it , it is c'est magnifique ! <sssss> perfect combination of peanut and light citrus with fresh greens and plenty of chicken . <sssss> the bun was juicy and tender and rich in flavor . <sssss> i wish i could order five dishes at one time here , but that seemed excessive . <sssss> i am excited to continue coming here for the prices , flavors and service ! <sssss> i hope it continues to flourish !
?		yogurtland ignites in me the delightful fiery craving for frozen yogurt . <sssss> usually when my sweet tooth comes a-knockin ' , it 's for cookies . <sssss> imagine my surprise upon trying yogurtland after a few trips to mojo and feeling so-so ... well , let 's just say i awkwardly moaned throughout my gastronomic experience , making those around me rather uncomfortable . <sssss> my apologies . <sssss> i was overwhelmed with nostalgic memories of the cool , melty satisfaction that clara 's frozen yogurt in toon town at disneyland gave me , which i last had when i was 12 . <sssss> that was ... a few years ago ... and now , i can relive it over and over again . <sssss> i 've tried the madagascar vanilla , ny cheesecake , and red velvet cupcake batter , and all have been a great hit . <sssss> i am also a bigger fan of the non-fruity options , but i think i 'll even give those a whirl the next time i 'm sampling !
?		so , i am cheating right now . <sssss> i actually tried this place via catering one day -- so i have no clue what their business looks like , whether or not they 've cleaned their tables properly or if it smells funny . <sssss> the only thing dirty is how good their pulled pork , pulled chicken , potato salad and beans are ... the meat is so melt-in-your-mouth tender that i actually had to remind myself to put the sauce on . <sssss> also , the sauce is tangy , spicy , and user-friendly -lrb- gluten-free -rrb- so everyone can enjoy ! <sssss> their side dishes compliment the meat-the beans are just a little smokey , and the potato salad has just enough mustard in it , to give it all an enthusiastic thumbs up . <sssss> i ca n't wait to actually visit and try out their other items ...
?		pei wei is like a fast-food version of pf changs -lrb- same owner/recipes -rrb- . <sssss> there is something that is a must for anybody trying pei wei for the first time : lettuce wraps . <sssss> absolutely worth the trip alone . <sssss> i normally get this for myself as my entree , and my fiance likes the honey chicken . <sssss> both are excellent . <sssss> i 've also tried the pad thai , and it was just ` ok ' . <sssss> the dumplings were above average , but as stated , the thing to get is the lettuce wraps . <sssss> for a chain , its pretty good . <sssss> the food has always been hot and fresh and flavors are great . <sssss> i love their ice tea as well . <sssss> service is always fast and courteous .
?		excellent burger ! <sssss> i had a classic smashburger and order of smash fries . <sssss> the burger was very juicy and tasty and the toppings were fresh . <sssss> not the best burger i 've ever had , but pretty dang good . <sssss> the smashfries are very good - but a very strong flavor . <sssss> my fiancé did n't care for the fries , she liked the regular fries with sea salt instead . <sssss> i guess my only complaint is the price . <sssss> a tad on the high side . <sssss> -lrb- 2 -rrb- smashburgers , 1 order of reg smashfries , 1 order of reg sea salt fries and a reg drink came to $ 18 . <sssss> still - it 's definitely worth going back . <sssss> fresh ingredients . <sssss> tasty 100 % angus beef burgers . <sssss> tons of options and toppings . <sssss> i 'll be back .
?		eh . <sssss> . <sssss> maybe i went on an off day . <sssss> or maybe i should n't have ordered a hotdog . <sssss> i got the chicago , my wife , a regular . <sssss> it was decent but not worth the drive for me . <sssss> should of stuck with regular fries ... the chili cheese fries were pretty gross ... and i 'm a huge fan of chili cheese fries . <sssss> however , their soda wall is impressive ! <sssss> tons of great choices . <sssss> $ 1.99 per bottle . <sssss> i guess that 's the going price , but wish it was less ... pretty gross location and the inside was clean but smelled of grease . <sssss> i guess i should of assumed that walking in . <sssss> it 's not terrible , but not great . <sssss> prices were decent overall and the service was fast and friendly . <sssss> i 'd only go back if i was in the area which i doubt i 'll be any time soon .
?		i do n't know what it is about phoenix , but you ca n't seem to find a decent donut shop here . <sssss> bosa seems to be about the best option we have , and while it 's not bad , it 's far from anything special . <sssss> this scottsdale location is much better managed than the chandler store , so i give them credit for that -- it 's cleaner and the donuts are much fresher . <sssss> i only wish phoenicians could experience a great donut , which will never come from places like bosa , krispy kreme , or dunkin donuts .
?		i 've been to gb many times and nearly always have a good experience . <sssss> they have quite a solid menu all around . <sssss> i really enjoy their sw eggrolls , garlic fries , burgers , chicken pesto pasta , pizzas , and steaks . <sssss> the deserts are very delicious . <sssss> portions are typically pretty generous and quality is consistently good . <sssss> if you want to go for a beer and appetizer , gb is a really good choice as well . <sssss> their brews are good , they have a lot of happy hour specials to choose from , and the bar area has a good ambiance . <sssss> they always have good tunes playing and several hd screens with various sports on . <sssss> this is one of my favorite chain restaurants .
?		some of the dishes at pho van are so good i pretty much just inhale them . <sssss> the noodle bowls are wonderful , filled with fresh ingredients , a rich mixture of flavors and variety of textures . <sssss> the food is healthy and very tasty . <sssss> they have some exotic drinks on the menu . <sssss> my favorite is the lychee drink , which is essentially 10 or so fresh lychees in water with crushed ice . <sssss> it 's very refreshing . <sssss> i will also note that the restaurant is conveniently located next to gelato 64 , so it 's always nice to walk next door and have a little sorbet or ice cream to cap things off !
?		this restaurant has really good quality seafood . <sssss> the menu is large . <sssss> the restaurant is large , romantic and has a separate bar area . <sssss> it 's very pretty and classy on the inside , but not snooty , meaning you can go casual and relax . <sssss> the food has always been good especially the catfish . <sssss> the prices are ok . <sssss> they 're generally anywhere from $ 11 - $ 15 for a really nice meal . <sssss> of course there 's pricier choices depending what you 're getting . <sssss> it 's a great atmosphere especially for a romantic date . <sssss> the only downside , it 's always packed whether you go there for lunch or dinner . <sssss> it does n't matter what day of the week . <sssss> it 's always super busy . <sssss> if it 's an especially busy nite like a friday or saturday , they will give you a pager . <sssss> sometimes the wait is over 1 hour . <sssss> alot of those people go to fridays directly next door for cheaper drinks then go back to pappadeaux when it 's gets closer to getting a table .
?		i love this place . <sssss> i 've been to numerous bars , grills , and restaurants . <sssss> there is nothing i do n't love about this place . <sssss> first , the food is outstanding , quality , and large portions . <sssss> happy hour has 1/2 off all drinks and 1/2 off all appetizers . <sssss> these are not your normal typical bar appetizers and they do not skimp on portions . <sssss> they have a great large bowl of mac and cheese with bacon as an appetizer and ends up costing $ 3 . <sssss> they give you a full plate of large wings with numerous choice of flavors . <sssss> 12 large wings . <sssss> not 6-8 like alot of poor happy hours give you . <sssss> they have a large appetizer list with a variety of great and unique choices . <sssss> they 're awesome and super cheap on happy hour and still priced well off of happy hour . <sssss> all drinks 1/2 off !! <sssss> all , not selected , not reduced priced by $ 1 . <sssss> half off period . <sssss> ca n't beat it . <sssss> they have large 64 ounce pitchers of mojitos , redbull and vodka , beer , and other drinks for $ 20 . <sssss> seriously , i 've been to happy hours where 1 redbull and vodka is $ 7.50 alone . <sssss> nevermind 64 ounces . <sssss> i 've had their chicken dinners , pasta dinners , numerous appetizers . <sssss> all outstanding . <sssss> the atmosphere has lots of big plasmas to watch any game . <sssss> their seating is unique . <sssss> they have large tables with part of the seating like a long comfy couch and the other seating are chairs . <sssss> very comfortable . <sssss> it 's a cool restaurant and sports bar that you can have great food , super cheap drinks , quality , fun , and it 's also good for families . <sssss> there is an area that sits away from the bar area . <sssss> i 've been there multiple times and it 's never busy . <sssss> it 's hidden and you ca n't see it from a major road . <sssss> it 's arounds indian school & scottsdale rd. . <sssss> go there . <sssss> try it . <sssss> happy hour 4-7 . <sssss> love everything about this place and only wish i lived closer .
?		this is a fun and funky place . <sssss> any music lover would like this place . <sssss> yes , it 's done in an alice cooper theme . <sssss> there is a large variety of collectable rock and roll memorabilia on the walls signed by a variety of artists . <sssss> there are gigantic tvs for any sports fans . <sssss> these tv are seriously huge . <sssss> the menu is fun and is fairly extensive . <sssss> the food has always been really good . <sssss> they have burgers , sandwiches , ribs , chicken , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> appetizers . <sssss> the burgers are large and the sandwiches are large . <sssss> they have a killer reuben . <sssss> these are not plain jane sandwiches . <sssss> they are done on quality breads and stacked with alot of meat . <sssss> they have a large selection of sides of your choice and they are all really good . <sssss> they taste very homemade , authentic and just good quality . <sssss> they have indoor and outdoor dining . <sssss> it 's two level . <sssss> it 's a cool place and would be a great place to take an out of state guest . <sssss> their desserts are huge . <sssss> great place all around . <sssss> there is a long bar with fair drink prices .
?		color me impressed . <sssss> given the quality of sushi restaurants in the greater valley area , i was worried about conveyor belt sushi here . <sssss> i mean , if they ca n't make it right in the kitchen , how is it gon na be on a roving belt ? <sssss> my worries were for naught . <sssss> despite the 30 minute wait on a tuesday night at 7:45 pm -lrb- yes , it was that crowded -rrb- , and having trouble finding it -lrb- there is no sign from the street -- you have to know where it is -rrb- , it was all worth it . <sssss> my companions -lrb- all fish eaters but me -rrb- loved it . <sssss> they said the fish was fresh , delicious , exciting etc. . <sssss> i loved the seaweed salad and edamame to start , and then went for two dishes of inari , a place of veggie rolls , and then wound up ordering 3 orders -lrb- so a total of 12 individual -rrb- avocado rolls , because none were coming around . <sssss> all that , plus iced tea , cost me $ 16 . <sssss> amazing . <sssss> my partner ate all sorts of rolls ; her favorite was the i love salmon roll and also the caterpillar roll , although she enjoyed the rainbow roll and dragon rolls as well . <sssss> was n't impressed with the las vegas roll , and wished that they had more exciting , different , unique rolls -lrb- they had one ; the haru sushi , which she did enjoy -rrb- . <sssss> her total , with iced tea ? <sssss> $ 18 . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> oh , and we shared a place of cream puffs for dessert . <sssss> there were no plates more than $ 2 . <sssss> the cheesecake had two $ 2 plates , making it 4 , but other than that , nothing , including special orders , was more than $ 2 . <sssss> the avocado rolls i had were some of the best i 've enjoyed -lrb- they were bursting full of avocado , instead of one small piece -rrb- , and the inari was delicious . <sssss> ginger on the table -lrb- as well as unagi sauce and soy sauce -rrb- , quick to fill up iced tea . <sssss> i was in heaven . <sssss> i do wish they 'd have more vegetarian rolls so i did n't have to order them . <sssss> the whole time we were there , only one veggie roll went by - the one i ate . <sssss> no cucumber , avocado , daikon , etc unless you ordered them . <sssss> i also wish wasabi was on the table , instead of brought to you in a hunk ; i did n't want to use it all at once , but i had to take it out of my dish to save for later and put ... where ? <sssss> also , i loved the `` other '' options , like juice , v8 , ramun -lrb- japanese soda -rrb- , pudding cups , fruit , cheesecake and more on the belt . <sssss> gave lots of options . <sssss> it did take forever to get our bill , but all that aside , we will most definitely be back .
?		i had been to the mojo on mill , however , i 'd never tired this one . <sssss> it had far less flavor options than on mill , but they had not one , not two , but three flavors of mochi and a whole ton a great fresh fruit . <sssss> i was quite satisfied by the topping selection ; if anything , there were too many options ! <sssss> however , what bumps this three star review up to four was the beanie wearing guy at the counter . <sssss> he was interesting , friendly , and he actually seemed to care about my responses . <sssss> not only that , but i 've been to mojo a ton of times , and no one ever offered me a punch card . <sssss> he did , and even gave me an extra punch . <sssss> service here definitely made the visit !
?		we 're not big fans of chain restaurants , but the cheesecake factory is an exception . <sssss> you always know you 're going to get tasty food , and a large serving -lrb- usually enough to share or take home half -rrb- . <sssss> plus , they 've got a huge menu with a good number of veggie options -lrb- veggie burger , salads , pastas , sandwiches , etc -rrb- . <sssss> i love love love their avocado eggrolls . <sssss> so much deliciousness wrapped in wonton skins and then fried , with a yummy cilantro sauce . <sssss> mmmm . <sssss> their corn cakes are also good , but the sauces on them are n't veggie ; just ask for salsa instead . <sssss> i also love the brown bread they serve with all meals , even if you 're just getting starters or cheesecake . <sssss> speaking of which , they 're actually pretty good , says my cheesecake snob partner -lrb- who is from ny -rrb- , and big enough to share easily . <sssss> i 've actually been over-serviced at multiple cheesecake locations , which i guess is better than not getting enough . <sssss> on nye , we went here for cheesecake , drinks and the free champagne toast ; we had two almost identical servers who clearly did n't communicate , and the two of us wound up with four classes of bubbly instead of two . <sssss> i 'm not gon na argue . <sssss> they may have their off days for service , but their food is good , their menu long , and their servings big . <sssss> it 's hard to argue with that .
?		i never thought i 'd be reviewing many chain restaurants , but this warrants a review . <sssss> i 've always been pretty happy with chipotle ; you know what you 're getting . <sssss> granted , the ones in co give you a free drink with a student id , and they do n't seem to do that in ny , pa or az , but the food is always pretty much the same , the cashiers run smoothly , and the lines move quickly . <sssss> here ? <sssss> not so much . <sssss> we waiting almost 25 minutes standing in line this sunday , and got maybe half of the food i 'm used to getting -lrb- i 'm a vegetarian ; a teaspoon of beans is n't going to give me much protein -rrb- . <sssss> my partners food was the same way , and up and down the line we heard people asking `` um , could you give a little more please '' or `` i 'd like a bit more than that , thanks . '' <sssss> same price , less food = sad shanna . <sssss> i 'm hoping this was a one time thing ... i love their salad and their soft tacos , but it 's not worth a line that long .
?		this is the first gay friendly restaurant/bar in phoenix that i 've actually really liked , and can see myself frequenting on a regular basis . <sssss> we visited on a week day night , and sat at the bar . <sssss> our bespeckled bartender was sweet , sassy , and kept our drinks full . <sssss> i also appreciated her know what was and was n't vegetarian , and providing a delicious recommendation for the veggie/cheese enchiladas . <sssss> the chips and three kind of salsas were a yummy starter , and disappeared almost as soon as they were put in front of us . <sssss> i had a diet coke , my partner a beer , and our two friends went with mixed drinks ; everyone was quite happy . <sssss> the food ? <sssss> oh god . <sssss> delicious . <sssss> the first vegetarian mexican food i 've been able to find in az . <sssss> . <sssss> everywhere else seems to have beef stock in their red sauce , but not here . <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> my partner got a chimichanga , and our friend one of the huge salads , and were all cleared our plates in no time flat . <sssss> the decor was fun , everyone was friendly , and i noticed my partner eyeing the brunch menu . <sssss> nothing like a little gay-tastic weekend brunch to really get you going . <sssss> we 'll most definitely be back !
?		i love love love ticoz , enjoy switch , and am still out with the jury on fez . <sssss> ergo , when there was another restaurant opening , my partner and i were so there . <sssss> we went with another set of queer folk , and one thing i love about all these places is that there is n't any anti-gay rudeness that i 've experienced in a good number of other places . <sssss> the menu is a bit sparse , and pretty much everything vegetarian -lrb- all 4 items -rrb- was fried , covered in cheese , or both , making for a not so healthy meal . <sssss> that said , my eggplant/goat cheese sandwich was delicious -lrb- although i 'm not sure about the iceberg lettuce and onion on it -rrb- . <sssss> the fries we ordered as a group ? <sssss> mediocre . <sssss> would go with delux 's fries any day over these . <sssss> the rest of the group -lrb- the non-veggies -rrb- loved their meal -lrb- burgers and the fish -rrb- , except my partner thought the pretzel bun was a bit off , and neither burger eater finished the bun . <sssss> they were not yet serving desserts , so i went for a drink . <sssss> the waiter -lrb- able , great with the service -rrb- suggested i try the naked -lrb- low calorie -rrb- brooklyn apple . <sssss> i did , we all tasted it , and sent it back . <sssss> it taste like fake sugar and fake apple flavor . <sssss> however , the naked vodka-rita was delicious . <sssss> atmosphere ? <sssss> loved it . <sssss> music ? <sssss> ah-may-zing . <sssss> parking ? <sssss> could n't find it . <sssss> add a few more veggie options , and we 'll definitely be back .
?		i 've been trying various cheap mexican food `` stands '' in an effort to find something that resembles what you find in san diego . <sssss> fiesta burrito is the best i 've found in the valley . <sssss> -lrb- note : los favoritos is up there with it -rrb- i 've had mostly burritos and rolled tacos , but i 've really liked them . <sssss> carne asada , bean-and-cheese , and breakfast burritos have all been very solid . <sssss> i like the rolled tacos , as well . <sssss> my companion on a recent visit ordered the `` rolled tacos supreme '' -lrb- where they pile carne asada and other stuff on top of 5 rolled tacos -rrb- . <sssss> wow , i 'd never noticed that before ... can i try one ? <sssss> in a word , awesome . <sssss> not very practical to eat , but really yummy . <sssss> although i expect -lrb- and accept -rrb- a little tummy-turning after a meal at a place like this , i 've never had even the slightest grumble after eating at fiesta . <sssss> it 's cheap and they do accept credit cards .
?		this is my favorite breakfast place in the valley . <sssss> i used to go to the scottsdale location more , but now i generally go to this location , because it is dog friendly ! <sssss> yay ! <sssss> the food is of the same consistent quality of the scottsdale restaurant . <sssss> same menu , same great protein pancakes , etc. . <sssss> i recommend the half-and-half -lrb- see further description in my review of the scottsdale location -rrb- i do n't find this one to be as busy as the scottsdale location , but there can be a wait on weekends . <sssss> but i 've found the servers and ownership to be very helpful , in particular when we have brought dogs . <sssss> because this locaiton is dog friendly , it gets an extra star pushing it to 5 stars !
?		unlike other reviewers , i 'm not on a first-name basis with the owners/employees . <sssss> we started with the spiced nuts -lrb- great -rrb- and the rock shrimp -lrb- average -rrb- . <sssss> the shrimp seemed like a well prepared version of a tgif appetizer . <sssss> not particularly thoughtful or memorable . <sssss> next we had the asparagus -lrb- great -rrb- and the mozzarella -lrb- odd -rrb- . <sssss> the asparagus was a great marriage of its ingredients , whereas the mozzarella left me thinking that the whole was much less than the parts . <sssss> the leeks , mozzarella , bread crumbs and fried egg did n't really complement each other . <sssss> the ingredients were each good , but the combination was , well , boring . <sssss> for entrees we had the bass and the chicken . <sssss> the sauce for the bass was great , but the fish itself was n't noteworthy . <sssss> the chicken was tender , but i had to cut back on the skin as the rub was extremely salty . <sssss> the veggies -lrb- leeks and fava beans -rrb- that came with the chicken were great . <sssss> for dessert we had the chocolate mint creme brulee and butterscotch pudding . <sssss> the creme brulee was a mistake , as all subtlety was lost in the dish . <sssss> i wish they 'd been serving a traditional creme brulee that night . <sssss> the butterscotch pudding was the highlight of the night . <sssss> the flavor was deep and complex and not overly sweet . <sssss> it was the best pudding i have ever had . <sssss> the service was solid . <sssss> we arrived for our reservation on time , and were immediately seated . <sssss> i liked how different members of the wait staff checked on us throughout the night , not just our assigned waitress . <sssss> the food was good but not great . <sssss> i appreciate that they use sustainable ingredients . <sssss> however , when you make a menu that small -lrb- the items i mentioned above represent nearly half the menu -rrb- , there is little room for error . <sssss> when i factor in the steep price , i do n't expect to be dining at fnb again , even for a special occasion .
?		wow this was a pampered weekend . <sssss> i would recommend going to this place just for fun . <sssss> i went with my wife for a weekend of ... hmmm ... and loved it . <sssss> . <sssss> so different and new and fresh . <sssss> staff is nice , rooms are clean , bathrooms are gorgeous ... a little pricey but you do get what you pay for loved it have fun
?		just like some others have said , the word that comes to mind is sexy ... i actually like this place a lot . <sssss> very nice and fancy and not as expensive as you would think . <sssss> i believe in quality and price going together but this place is surprisingly reasonable . <sssss> valet and validation available , curteous staff , great sushi , great bar ... it is very good .
?		i do love the cheesecake factory . <sssss> you ca n't really go wrong here , pretty much every dish is gon na be good . <sssss> i had the mac & cheese burger . <sssss> fantastic ! <sssss> just picture a juicy savory burger topped with a patty made of mac & cheese . <sssss> i loved it . <sssss> my only complaint is the menu is too big ! <sssss> takes me forever to pick something , everything sounds soo good . <sssss> not a bad problem to have .
?		my boyfriend & i decided to try this place ... and we were not disappointed . <sssss> it was delicious !! <sssss> cute place , clean , and everyone who worked there was super friendly . <sssss> i had the miso ramen and the bf had the shoyu ramen , both were so good ! <sssss> i love ramen noodles , this place takes it to a whole new level : -rrb-
?		best dive in phoenix . <sssss> good people & drinks .
?		best torta in az . <sssss> . <sssss> i am in love with this place . <sssss> i have n't even tried anything else , i love their torta 's that much .
?		nasty margarita and awful service . <sssss> came in on a thursday night before a movie and it was not good . <sssss> maybe it 's because we sat at the bar ? <sssss> i 'm not sure , but no one wanted to help us . <sssss> the house margarita was so gross , could n't drink it . <sssss> this place is like the chili 's of mexican food .
?		finally found a dish i like a bws . <sssss> i get the honey mustard salad which is tasty . <sssss> since my husband is a fan of bws i 'll be back .
?		yup best mexican food in the area ! <sssss> the tortillas are homemade and you can taste the difference it makes . <sssss> ordered the soft taco combo and it came it rice and beans . <sssss> ordered the chips and salsa too . <sssss> was yummy all the way around . <sssss> will go back .
?		friendly family environment , i eat alone a lot and they let me sit and read my book and enjoy coffee before my meal . <sssss> i can only speak to the breakfast items and have loved everything i have eaten here . <sssss> i do love a good hollandaise sauce and mark makes a few good ones . <sssss> also , the eggs are cooked perfectly ! <sssss> it is always clean and usually busy , but that busy never interferes in the awesome attitudes of the whole staff . <sssss> thank you mark 's for being a class act !
?		the staff was super helpful and friendly , the rooms were clean and cute and i loved all the pool areas . <sssss> i will defiantly try a ` stay-cation ' here this summer .
?		great funky band , attentive service on the drinks , and we found a table in this crowded little blues club . <sssss> i loved that the patrons where eclectic and fun and people wanted to dance and kick back . <sssss> it was to loud in there either . <sssss> the bathrooms left a lot to be desired , but if you are looking for some good funky music and a place to let your hair down and dance than this is the spot !
?		wifey and i dined here in nov. , 2008 , and we found this joint to be very overpriced and very average . <sssss> the place was dead on a weeknight , a bad sign . <sssss> the room looked like it could hold 300 people , and there were only about 7 of us total . <sssss> service was good , but chips and salsa was mediocre , food -lrb- nachos and enchiladas -rrb- was average , even below average . <sssss> we found it to be more expensive than other , similar mexican restaurants in the area . <sssss> i would not go here again .
?		i know you 'll come here for the beer , but i have been to this joint twice with wifey , and the food is really good ! <sssss> we 've had salads , wings , a burger , and appetizers , all items have been very tasty and fresh . <sssss> if you happen to be up near pima , frank lloyd wright , and n. scottsdale , give this place a try for lunch or dinner !
?		we went here for a birthday celebration and had the `` family feast '' deal they have . <sssss> its for gluttons , but everything was really good ! <sssss> it included desserts , but i was way too stuffed for anything like that y the time we had finished our regular courses .
?		wifey and i have been dining here for 4 years now , and we really like it . <sssss> its too spicy for some , and we have tried nearly everything on their menu , with only one or two disappointments . <sssss> price is right , the salsa and chips are great , decor is funky and colorful , service is just ok sometimes . <sssss> best stuff on the menu - white sands chimichanga is great ! <sssss> the fundido cheese appetizer is fantastic as well . <sssss> chili colorado is spicy and one of my favorites , as well as the grande nachos . <sssss> breakfast on weekends only is a killer bargain , and the new mexican eggs benedict is a winner ! <sssss> very , very cheap as well . <sssss> i am not sure why this place has received such mediocre reviews , as its not generic & boring mexican food such as macayo 's , garduno 's , manuel 's , or garcias !
?		typical sports bar , in dire need of some redecorating ! <sssss> this place looks -lrb- and smells -rrb- like 1974 , nix the hd tv 's . <sssss> its an ok place to meet a pal for a beer , but no dates , or it 'll be your last date with that gal !
?		just finished another meal here courtesy of a gift card . <sssss> this place is always busy and i 've never been able to understand why . <sssss> if no one ever gave me a gift card here , i would never eat here . <sssss> the service varies from very good to awful , but the food always never exceeds `` well , it did n't make me sick . '' <sssss> today 's meal failed even that low standard . <sssss> as an appetizer i ordered some mini-corn dogs . <sssss> i * love * corn dogs . <sssss> at the fair , from weinerschnitzel , from frozen at home , and so on . <sssss> these little balls of corn meal enriched pancake batter were deep fried to near burnt and yet managed to soak up enough grease to squeeze out nice puddle of oil . <sssss> i only ate one , but within five minutes i was nauseas . <sssss> the california omelet was not much better . <sssss> sour cream should n't curdle , right ? <sssss> the veggies and cheese were barely cooked . <sssss> it was more like a salad wrap , where the wrap happened to be egg . <sssss> if i had wanted a salad with egg , i 'd have ordered a cobb , not an omelet . <sssss> the banana cheese cake was good according to the spousal unit & i enjoyed my strawberry lemonade . <sssss> still have $ 10 left on the gift card . <sssss> i think that 'll get me a couple of lemonades .
?		last time i ate here i left a rather scathing review , so i figured it was time for a second visit . <sssss> unfortunately i must have gone to the wrong restaurant because the food here was great ! <sssss> pastry was spot on this time . <sssss> firm , but not crumbly ! <sssss> i could cut it without the entire structure failing . <sssss> i was even able to pick up the pasty and eat it traditional - a la hand . <sssss> i had the cottage pie -lrb- same as last time -rrb- and the taste difference was immediately noticeable . <sssss> the ground beef was moist but not fatty and there was cheese ! <sssss> i do n't remember cheese last time . <sssss> for personal taste : i still think it needs more veggie , less potato , and a splash of worcestershire . <sssss> i also had the oven chips w / garlic - awesome ! <sssss> if you 've ever eaten the garlic fries at other places like gordon biersch , these blow them away ! <sssss> real crushed garlic on real thick cut potatoes , slightly caramelized from baking . <sssss> not some rub-on paste placed on deep fried frozen battered spud strips . <sssss> now the complaints : 1 -rrb- the noise - still too much loud bass . <sssss> the walls , floor , and ceiling are all hard surfaces . <sssss> the conversations and music bounce off these surfaces and create a cacophony neutralizing most conversation . <sssss> 2 -rrb- the parking - there is no handicapped parking available anywhere near the restaurant . <sssss> what parking there is , is cramped and narrow . <sssss> parking a pick-up was a challenge . <sssss> even the people in the toyota camry had issues maneuvering .
?		stopped in for a light lunch on a saturday . <sssss> service was good , if not exactly warm . <sssss> the menu was small , but with good variety and the food tasted great . <sssss> the coffee was quite good as well . <sssss> my friends and i had 6 different drinks between us and everyone had positive comments . <sssss> the biggest complaint was the odd arrangement of tables and single patrons hogging four seats or more at a time , even at the bar . <sssss> good enough to patronize if i 'm in the area , not good enough for a special trip .
?		first - the service was prompt and polite . <sssss> kudos to the wait staff . <sssss> the brunch menu looks amazing . <sssss> the reality was not . <sssss> the promise : corned buffalo hash w / poached eggs , 4 slices of thick cut bacon , and a biscuit with gravy . <sssss> the reality : the corned buffalo hash was n't a hash at all . <sssss> a hash would indicate the meat and potatoes are in some way mixed . <sssss> about 4oz of the corned `` meat '' - i say `` meat '' because it was so generic it could have been nearly anything - was apparently pulled from the stew pot -lrb- still quite soupy -rrb- and laid atop 5 halves of fingerling potatoes -lrb- yes 5 , i 'm not sure why the odd number -rrb- . <sssss> even more sad , half of the meat was a lump of fat . <sssss> not just some connective tissue , an impenetrable squishy blob of fat . <sssss> the poached eggs were ok . <sssss> the bacon was awesome tasting , although too tough to cut with a fork and requiring some serious chewing to really enjoy . <sssss> the biscuit and gravy was fairly good . <sssss> not traditional as it has a very sweet taste . <sssss> the biscuit required a knife and fork to get trough the crust , but still not bad tasting . <sssss> the aftermath : at a cost of $ 32 for one plate of less than inspring food - i 'll only be back if someone else is dragging me and paying .
?		great place ! <sssss> finally a great seafood place in the valley . <sssss> went here for lunch monday as my wife was shopping up the street at last chance -lrb- which i call the crazy lady store -rrb- . <sssss> nice ambiance and atmosphere . <sssss> rock star service from bartender heather . <sssss> she went above the call of duty in her service . <sssss> i really admire and make note of when a server goes the extra mile . <sssss> she brought out samples of both of their chowders for us to taste as they were trying new recipes . <sssss> the new england chowder was creamy goodness and out of this world . <sssss> at the end of the meal she offered without prompting to put our drinks in plastic cups to go . <sssss> nice extra effort heather . <sssss> food : sourdough bread had great flavor - bit hard on the end caps though . <sssss> i had mahi-mahi sliders and they were awesome ! <sssss> fish seasoned and cooked perfectly . <sssss> it came with a roasted 1/2 roma -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- tomato that really added flavor to the bite sandwich . <sssss> only issue is i bit into it and the friggin ' tomato squirted on my shirt . <sssss> oh , the bun was also above par buttery and fluffy . <sssss> wife ordered a burger , yes a burger in a fish house - blasphemy i say ! <sssss> oh well , to each their own . <sssss> usually the last thing you want to order in a fish house ; however , bwg serves a good a $ $ burger . <sssss> i was pleasantly surprised as my wife gave me a few bites . <sssss> bonus for ye ol' land-lovers . <sssss> need to go back for dinner and hit that raw bar . <sssss> double thumbs up for bwg !!
?		valle luna chandler my wife and i were kid free the other night and were deciding where to go and deducted down to valle luna because of the lakeside setting . <sssss> we got there and parked in the lot and the very first thing you see in the front parking lot is an overflowing open gated nasty dumpster with boxes and rotton food spewing out . <sssss> we nearly turned around and said s@rew this , but we did n't . <sssss> inside we asked the host for patio seating which she said was booked ; however , there was first-come-first-serve on the bar patio . <sssss> scored a ringside seat next to the lake ! <sssss> yippie ! <sssss> i 'm so gettin ' some tonight with this setting . <sssss> however , the ambiance was really marred by 2 things . <sssss> first was the wafting of clouds of cigarette smoke lofting into our serene spot . <sssss> ewww , not to be a hypocrite as i smoked like 12 years ago . <sssss> . <sssss> no check that cigarettes are gross . <sssss> the other issue was the extremely intoxicated middle aged foul mouthed trashy cougar hooker seated behind us . <sssss> her and her skank girlfriend sat down about 1/2 hour after we did and she was friggin ' hammered upon being seated . <sssss> she later exclaimed to her friend about how she 'd been drinking wine all day ... yea really , you handle and hide it well . <sssss> i totally shook my head as i watched the server dude take her order and thought , `` dude you 're not really going to serve that sloshy puddle more booze are you ? '' <sssss> and he did - and multiple times . <sssss> unbelievable ! <sssss> where 's the liquor board when they 're needed . <sssss> the other issue about the facility is the stank in the bar area . <sssss> it has the aroma of a high school boys locker room . <sssss> they really need to address this as it 's nasty ... carpet looks like it has n't been cleaned this millennium . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong drinking a corona light in this atmoshere and my wife had a don julio blanca marg rocks that was good to . <sssss> later she prdered teh same but with a chambord shot in it ... awesome drink ! <sssss> my wife loves that they serve a bean dip with the chips and i thought the salsa was very tasty and chunky . <sssss> i hate it when the salsa is watery thin . <sssss> chips were good ny wife said as i do n't eat them . <sssss> my wife had red cili enchiladas that were just ok ... nothing special . <sssss> i was pleased to see sea bass on the menu ... yea ! <sssss> ordered it but the server forgot to ask me which of the 2 sauces i wanted or about the sides . <sssss> i flagged him down and told him the sauce and also said that i did n't want any rice . <sssss> food comes , there 's the friggin ' rice all over my plate . <sssss> i 'm not really picky but seriously i asked specifically for no rice and there it is and it 's not like you can just push it aside as it crosses the international borders into the veggies , beans and fish sauce ... forced to have a re-make . <sssss> 8 minutes later and my wife is 1/2 done and here it comes back out . <sssss> looks good ... taste is stone cold ... what a shame as it was a good looking piece of fish . <sssss> without that lake ... we would never come back .
?		dishonest staff & two separate bungled hotel experiences this was our second visit here as the staff bungled the first visit in july so horribly bad that we were offered to come back and stay again . <sssss> actually that 's not really correct either as when we first stayed there we checked out after only being there for 2 1/2 hours and had paid and not been reimbursed . <sssss> no call back from management . <sssss> they sent an e-mail bot `` how was your stay ? '' <sssss> only then a manager calls . <sssss> i told him -lrb- robert -rrb- my wife would n't be interested in returning . <sssss> he pleaded and said that he would personally assure a wonderful experience . <sssss> when i called to book , robert did not return 3 calls that i had made requesting the room . <sssss> yes 3 calls . <sssss> i then called the front desk asked the gal to book a room with the voucher tells me she has a room with two beds . <sssss> i said that does n't work for my wife and i . <sssss> she then tells me one king is available but for like $ 35.00 more . <sssss> so yes there was one available , they just want to extort some extra $ . <sssss> so i 'm thinking , `` this place screwed up badly , begged us to come back and then wants to nickel and dime me for a king bed , '' on that note , integrity is very important to me and this hotel has a dishonest staff . <sssss> if one thing happens , well meh . <sssss> 2 things happen its alarming . <sssss> 3 and 4 things happen , well , i 'm pissed off . <sssss> the pool bartender was nice . <sssss> i was given 3 rounds of drinks while seated there and he only charged for 1 . <sssss> yea , i hear folks screaming , `` what are you complaining about ? '' <sssss> well , it 's dishonest and it 's stealing . <sssss> i do n't like thieves and did n't ask for free drinks nor did i expect them . <sssss> i never walk in to macy 's to buy a shirt and expect the clerk to give me a tie and belt for free do i ? <sssss> this experience really sucks because i really really wanted to like this place as i have a liking to mid-century kitschy cool design and this place fits that bill . <sssss> rooms are retro-eclectic and nice . <sssss> i hurt my back prior to coming here and was rather annoyed that no one told us that there were no elevators so i had to lug luggage up stairs which irritated me . <sssss> i understand it 's an older building but staff should have said something prior . <sssss> it is a long haul from your room to go get ice . <sssss> i also went to the restaurant to ask for a spoon as my wife had some ben & jerrys and the server was rude . <sssss> otherwise we checked out without incidence - i thought . <sssss> my wife comes to me a couple days later and asks me what the $ 50.00 charge was . <sssss> so i call the hotel to inquire kristen told me i was charged for a bottle of belvedere vodka . <sssss> i assured her that we did not drink it . <sssss> she said it would be refunded . <sssss> i told her i was disturbed that i was charged for this without asking and asked why and she said , `` well obviously ... somebody as in our minibar department went into your room or it was just a mistaken room number ... or anything could have happened . <sssss> but we 'll get it sorted out for you . '' <sssss> i said , `` ok please do '' and guessed that was the end of it . <sssss> i also was n't very satisfied with the `` anything could have happened '' explanation . <sssss> to me this is quite sneaky to charge a customer 's credit card in this fashion without consent and explanation . <sssss> it 's not like they do n't have my e-mail and/or phone number to inform me of the charge . <sssss> that 's dishonest . <sssss> my guess would also be an integrity issue again with the hotel valley ho staff for missing liquor . <sssss> i was never reimbursed . <sssss> i call back again 3 weeks later and brian said that he would take my name and number and call me back with information . <sssss> the same brian called me back a half hour later and abruptly asked , `` what was the issue ? '' <sssss> and in a somewhat curt tone . <sssss> i explained the situation again and told him the charges were supposed to be reversed and were n't . <sssss> he then said in a snarky fashion , `` fine , if you did n't take it home with you then i 'll reimburse it to your visa . '' <sssss> at this point i 'm really angry as he said it in tone implying that i might be lying about it . <sssss> nice way to treat your customers . <sssss> well , guess what ? <sssss> yea , brian never reversed the charges . <sssss> twice they said they would reverse the charges and did n't ; feels really dishonest at this point . <sssss> it 's only $ 50 bucks but to me it 's the principle of the continued dishonesty and then having to spend 20 minutes more on the phone with my bank filing a `` charge dispute '' was time consuming and once again irritating . <sssss> i have much better things to do then waste time with the hotel valley ho 's bungling .
?		sat at the bar and had absolutely wonderful service . <sssss> boy does that make such a difference . <sssss> friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive . <sssss> we did happy hour . <sssss> i had a flight of their house beers . <sssss> really liked their hefeweizen ; crisp and tasty . <sssss> we had the wings buffalo style m with blue cheese sub for ranch . <sssss> my wife did n't like them saying they were soggy . <sssss> i thought they were ok but rather scrawny . <sssss> they need larger ramekins to dip in too . <sssss> i had the 5 meat deep dish and i was astonished how good it was . <sssss> really thick with the meat . <sssss> again bartenders edith and corey were outstanding . <sssss> if we lived near by i would come back just for their service .
?		cafe monarch is everything and more that fans say it is . <sssss> it is `` more '' when you experience it for yourself . <sssss> lately , i 've been going to some really nice restaurants in town and i can not find anything that can top chef christopher 's food . <sssss> everything here is made right in front of you and it 's so fresh . <sssss> chef christopher rarely serves the same thing twice . <sssss> he 's so innovative and comes up with the best flavor profiles . <sssss> loved the ribs - they were so rich and fell off the bone . <sssss> the sauce and the polenta were amazing . <sssss> every dessert i 've had there has been amazing too . <sssss> usually something involving a fruit but also chocolate , which seems to be a must when you go there . <sssss> talk to chef christopher . <sssss> he is a very humble chef . <sssss> his talents are top-notch and really have n't been met by any other valley restaurants i 've been to .
?		mmm ... mmmm ... mmmm delish ! <sssss> the toasted coconut ice cream rocks ! <sssss> very creamy yet lots of texture in every bite with lots of toasted coconut throughout . <sssss> the dark chocolate was amazing ! <sssss> such a rich taste . <sssss> my family also had the icecream sandwiches , but they were sorry they got them . <sssss> they felt like they were eating more cookie than ice cream . <sssss> so although they were very good , next time they will just get the pure icecream . <sssss> maybe a cookie on the side ? <sssss> such a cute place and the employees were very pleasant . <sssss> check it out !
?		out in chandler today and was excited to finally try this place that was recommended by some locals . <sssss> was n't sure what to expect for a sub shop . <sssss> different concept as far as first impressions . <sssss> place was packed and it was about 1pm . <sssss> . <sssss> every table taken . <sssss> fireman equipment and artifacts everywhere . <sssss> right away i 'm trying to break down the menu as fast as i can since people behind me are waiting and it 's an order-at-the-counter place . <sssss> staff was great . <sssss> asked what i was in the mood for . <sssss> pointed out a few items . <sssss> i went for a sub w / turkey , mushrooms , and swiss . <sssss> i asked if the mushrooms were fried . <sssss> the employee explained how they have a special press that steams the meat and cheese together before it goes on the roll . <sssss> nothing there is fried . <sssss> sandwich was very good . <sssss> enjoyed the crispness of the roll . <sssss> there was a great amount of turkey , unlike most popular sub shops around . <sssss> i would have liked a bit more cheese and mushrooms . <sssss> a little more `` savoryness '' but i think that could have come in had i chosen one of their specialty sauces . <sssss> i 'm definitely trying one of the sauces next trip ! <sssss> i think i needed a little more `` zip ! ''
?		couple things i love in life , hot dogs and maui , now brought together and maui dog proves that hot dogs can have some unique flavor other than plain mustard and/or ketchup . <sssss> had a beef dog with spicy chipotle-mayo and mango salsa to keep the flavors singled out a bit . <sssss> dog was cooked perfectly , bun seemed a little hefty for the setup but i suppose you could argue most dogs here get more loaded than mine . <sssss> mango salsa was really sweet , complimented the juicy hot dog well and all together had a little heat . <sssss> venue was a little standalone building with simple tables and chairs inside and some picnic type wooden tables out on the patio . <sssss> very maui/hawaiian design , as to be expected . <sssss> again simple . <sssss> that 's not a bad thing . <sssss> shops in maui are exactly the same , they 're quick and simple and focus on the food not fancy deco . <sssss> got the chance to meet the owner , very friendly guy and made sure we were happy with everything . <sssss> currently they only take cash but have a pos machine there for debit/credit but the girl said the company coded it wrong ? <sssss> in either regard they 'll take cards soon enough . <sssss> i 'm rarely on that side of town but if i 'm in the area again i 'll definitely do what i can to stop by and try a different variant and maybe ... maybe some spam sliders . <sssss> my recommendation is that you try it out . <sssss> ca n't go wrong with a good dog .
?		lots of glitz and glam , little to back it up . <sssss> food was meh ... really expensive too . <sssss> margs were good but i can get the same for cheaper . <sssss> my friend got sick from the food she ate ... not impressed ... never went back . <sssss> nuff said
?		i 've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there . <sssss> thoughts : staff was friendly and quick , nice place , very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well . <sssss> chicken salad bagel sandwich was n't too bad at all , except for the nuts in it - i 'd probably eat it again however . <sssss> had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it ... yum ! <sssss> i 'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now : -rrb-
?		oh yeah . <sssss> . <sssss> best little mexican place in these parts . <sssss> breakfast burrito 's rock !! <sssss> very friendly staff , seems like family owned because i always see the same two ladies working . <sssss> their salsa is so good too , and you get a little salsa bar to play in too . <sssss> and they 've got the best horchata i 've ever tasted , but i 'm a white guy so why listen to me ... go try it yourself : -rrb- hard to see also but they have a back patio that could be good for small to medium sized groups . <sssss> fail comes in when i want food on sunday ... no dice , closed on sundays ...
?		little slow at lunch but they seemed understaffed . <sssss> sausage pizza was good and about what i expected from friend reviews . <sssss> they seem to have good specials on thursdays for `` date nights '' but it 's just average . <sssss> nothing special but if i was in the area and wanted pizza i 'd go in again .
?		went for the great arizona picnic on saturday and was not that impressed . <sssss> when i go to something like this i expect to try something new and exciting . <sssss> what did i get here ? <sssss> the same spinato 's pizza and salty senorita food i can get out in town , not to mention mega chains like buffalo wild wings , the melting pot and chipotle . <sssss> meh ... the abolut tent was nothing special either , i mean , you can get that stuff in any bar . <sssss> why stand around with a bunch of d-bags in a tiny fenced in area fighting to get a drink ? <sssss> let me sum up the event ... 1 . <sssss> wait in line to get in ... 2 . <sssss> wait in line to get a 21 year old wrist band ... 3 . <sssss> wait in line to get tickets ... 4 . <sssss> wait in line to get food ... 5 . <sssss> wait in line to get into the beer/absolut/patron areas ... 6 . <sssss> wait in line for a drink ... 7 . <sssss> wait in line for the port o potty ... repeat steps 3-7 ... the only bright spot was the beer garden , got to try a lot of unique beers that i have never seen in any stores in phoenix , so that was kinda cool .
?		this time of year , when it 's a little chilly out , or you 're thinking you might be coming down with a cold , i got the cure ... get a giant bowl of pho ! <sssss> if you 're not sure what it is , or you 're a little freaked out by new foods , do n't be . <sssss> to over simplify it , basically it 's some of the best beef noodle soup you will ever have ! <sssss> the shrimp and pork spring rolls are really good as well . <sssss> this place is also quick for lunch and the service is always good .
?		wow , this place was a disappointment . <sssss> a group of us ended up here around 10pm on a friday night . <sssss> we were seated pretty quickly . <sssss> the menu looked good , but was very limited for a tapas place . <sssss> we ordered a couple bottles of wine and started to order food and the first 2 things we asked for on the menu , they were out of . <sssss> really ? <sssss> i mean if you only have a handful of things on the menu , you might want to make sure you do n't run out of anything . <sssss> we finally decided on some plates to share and to say that they were small is an insult to all things small . <sssss> it would be one thing if it was small and the best thing i had ever eaten , but most of it was mediocre at best . <sssss> the other thing , there was almost no bread served with dishes . <sssss> it 's tough to sit around , talk and enjoy yourself when the portions are are only a couple of bites . <sssss> god forbid you actually come here for dinner instead of a snack , you 'll drop a hundred bucks a person to get full . <sssss> if you want a good spanish inspired meal , skip this place and walk a couple blocks over to the mission , you 'll be glad you did .
?		great lunch specials ! <sssss> the best green tea ever ! <sssss> love this place . <sssss> always great fast service .
?		pita jungle is awesomeness ! <sssss> the only reason i 'm giving this place three stars is because the last time i ate here my lettuce had fruit fly on it . <sssss> yuck ! <sssss> the gyro 's i had before the fruit fly experience were tasty .
?		i 've avoided yelping this place for a reason ; that reason is that it sucks just as badly as their other location in the hilton village . <sssss> the food is horrible , the diners are mostly douches and although this location features less popped collars than the one in sdl i can not figure out for the life of me why certain people and bloggers can claim this as some of the best pizza in the valley . <sssss> sub-par food , service and experience in both locations .
?		baker is my first go-to place when i 'm looking to add to my gardens . <sssss> tons of natives , cacti , herbs and etc fill their property & i can always find what i need . <sssss> they also have experts and some special shows on occasion which are very interesting to see .
?		i really enjoy that 's a wrap ... all of the food i 've ordered here has been really enjoyable , plus it 's all a really good value for the money . <sssss> my favorite wrap here is the prince of thai , sin pollo con tofu . <sssss> the veggie bowl is also another good option and i 'm pleased they can make anything vegetarian . <sssss> worth a stop for lunch , however , the parking lot is tight and i have been here more than once when it was full .
?		after stopping by here several times to buy bread on sunday , because pane bianco is closed , i had the opportunity to have breakfast here several times ; amazing food and grocery area . <sssss> very glad they have a complimentary valet these days but seating can be chaotic . <sssss> love the strawberry brioche , pizza , and daybreaker sammie sans meat ! <sssss> buy the reuseable cups for cheap iced tea refills which are necessary in phx during the hot summers .
?		one of my favorite yelpers already said it , but now i will too despite ever been to atlantic city . <sssss> as a casino this place is a gloom miasma of sadness . <sssss> i do n't compare it to other casinos on sovereign soil , due to my active avoidance of stated establishments , but i can recognize unhealthy behavior of disinhibition when i see it . <sssss> it 's always the same smell too , and i do n't know if it is tobacco or hopelessness that gives off the worse stank . <sssss> the slovenly patrons that voluntarily and yet with instant regret feed machines that reward the patron and the immediate environment with psychologically precise combination of mind numbing flashes of light and candy sweet sounds of virtually designed incentive . <sssss> is it etiquette to avoid showers while being an active gambler ? <sssss> does one have to treat one 's body like a mr. fusion home energy reactor that is installed on a delorean dmc-12 in the future ? <sssss> -lrb- yes , back to the future reference -rrb- i was here for a concert , and the concert hall is not meant for this kind of venue . <sssss> the acoustic is n't good , and there are objects that disrupt the visual stimuli for which monies have been exchanged for the pleasure to both hear and see some kind of entertaining modern court jester . <sssss> i will not actively avoid this place , but i have no direct desire to go back either . <sssss> the prices of drinks are pushing the limits for the content and ingenuity , and the quality of people certainly does not make up for the difference .
?		d i s a p p o i n t e d ! <sssss> i had long put off my visit to cd , but this last friday was the day . <sssss> we arrived and was greeted by a gentleman that i was n't sure if he worked there or not , but soon it would turn out he was our server for the evening . <sssss> he was very attentive and answered any and all question we might have had , even though the answers was straight off the menus description of the same items . <sssss> but he took our drink order , and brought it out shortly . <sssss> from this moment he circled our table and frequently stopped by , asking if we wanted to put in a entrée-order - right after we have got our very extensive appetizer selection . <sssss> -lrb- i found this very odd , because there is no way that we would been even halfway done with our apps before our entrée would have been ready . <sssss> -rrb- from this minute our waiter stopped checking on us , in fact he might have left the restaurant , and we had no service at all . <sssss> * food i imagined this to be a culinary gem , but as nice as their cheeses are . <sssss> . <sssss> i must say i was greatly disappointed in the meal ; most of all the hyped soft pretzels & provolone fondue . <sssss> i can not believe how this is raved about . <sssss> the soft pretzels are most certainly not baked on the premises , and the fondue could be made my kraft . <sssss> shitty shitty shitty and overpriced . <sssss> * service a place like cd needs to have great to outstanding service , but i found it to be the crappiest experience i have ever had in scottsdale . <sssss> our snot nosed waited should be fired , and the rest of the eclectic bunch are so inattentive when we tried to flag them down , mainly for the check once we had been ignored for an hour . <sssss> an hour ! <sssss> -lrb- by eclectic , i mean that it is hard to see who is working there due to the extreme casual dress-suggestion of the waitstaff . <sssss> normally i am all for this , because you usually can pick out the waiters/waitresses by behavior and attitude . <sssss> nopes ! <sssss> -rrb- * ambiance here is the stars ! <sssss> it 's a nice big place cd have here in scottsdale , and even if i think the chandeliers is a bit much i like the layout and the bar area very much . <sssss> even the furniture . <sssss> this is nice on many levels . <sssss> this is where i give two stars , since the rest is extremely overrated . <sssss> * overall the food is substandard , and i tried all over the appetizers . <sssss> all over . <sssss> i mean the entrees could technically be divine , but then you might have to order it straight to the chef and pick it up yourself . <sssss> i would have loved to have spoken to a manager about the lack of service - but the absence of service even made this into a mission for ethan hawke -lrb- if he 'd choose to accept it -rrb- . <sssss> i will not come back . <sssss> unless it is to have a dinner meeting with a manager .
?		sushi , cute girls , tasty beverages - whats not to like ? <sssss> the dj could have toned it down just a tad , since i had flashbacks from a car stereo competition from my childhood . <sssss> but enough of me dating myself , and i 'll leave my seat on the balcony next to waldorf for a minute -lrb- ad hoc muppet 's reference -rrb- . <sssss> the happy hour is fantastic , and since we realized that the hh was still in effect when we arrived , we ordered promptly . <sssss> i started of with a coffe drink mixed with vodka and attitude - i would have it again , but after that i probably just order what i like and not go for goofy names of weird mixtures . <sssss> the food was awesome but the rolls that are affected by happy hour are very much alike , and that 's cool . <sssss> the appetizers i had was all great . <sssss> just deliciously unhealthy and tasty . <sssss> the rolls was good , but we ordered too much food and by the end i was just stuffed . <sssss> i will definitely come back here , both for happy hour and not . <sssss> i was genuinely impressed in a place where i did n't think i was going to be . <sssss> in retrospect i think i should have opted for outside seating due to the lower volume from the dj 's personal favorite remixes .
?		i am not a huge fan of fast food -lrb- or at least that is what people are supposed to say -rrb- but sometimes poor planning prevents a situation where one need to eat something quickly . <sssss> i try to choose a place i have never tried before . <sssss> this time , it was smashburger . <sssss> it is not as quick as your more common fast food places . <sssss> not at all . <sssss> but i like the menu-alternatives alot once i stepped inside the doors . <sssss> i had the smashburger . <sssss> it was really good . <sssss> it was dripping of all sorts of juices , and made it harder to eat - but the burger was good . <sssss> still just a burger , but for a burger it was tasty . <sssss> i also had the smashfries -lrb- hints of garlic and rosemary -rrb- and they are thin , crispy and delicious . <sssss> the service are very polite , but they are n't very fast - but then again they are very polite . <sssss> i take curtisy over speed any day .
?		disguised as a dive in location and by name , it 's not really that divey . <sssss> in fact it has a established feel to it as i escape the phoenix summer into a dark bar that is far less silly than the sign suggests . <sssss> i expected an atmosphere of sweet depression and melancholy , but find a very standard bar that is bigger than i could have imagined . <sssss> i would n't go here to eat , if that was my main purpose . <sssss> the food is ok , but i do n't find the kitchen containing any culinary surprises but the wings are fried , sauced and then grilled . <sssss> that 's nice . <sssss> the service is fair . <sssss> i came here to meet people and play some games . <sssss> i never got to the game part at all , but that 's ok and i do n't regret it . <sssss> i have no doubts that i will get back here on one occasion or another . <sssss> i has a certain appeal , even if i am not sure what it is . <sssss> so , for a dive its great - but even for a dive i can ask for more . <sssss> do n't change monkey pants . <sssss> .
?		sometimes i get this feeling that it is a good thing to overpopulate a bowl of frozen meat shavings , then add a handful of veggies and top it off with my own improvised blend of sauce ingredients . <sssss> -lrb- yes there is recipes on the wall , but i always screw up . <sssss> -rrb- i will say up front that this is a franchise , and i really dont like franchises . <sssss> / the good they encourage the attempts to increase the maximum fill-level , by patrons own ingenuity , of the designated bowl . <sssss> i like that you can make your own sauce , and they have plenty of ingredients . <sssss> you do n't have to fit rice in the bowl , that you grab afterward . <sssss> . <sssss> as much as you want . <sssss> / the bad i ca n't say that there is anything directly bad about this place . <sssss> if you have walked in here , you know what a mongolian grill is and then you have accepted the terms of the procedure . <sssss> / the unexpected the price includes a drink , rice and questionable frozen yogurt -lrb- and unlimited refills thereof -rrb- , but you have to pay 50c for a classic to-go american-asian doggy bag . <sssss> stay classy yc ... und das ist nach der karnivor kritiker
?		as much as i like beer and good service , of which both gb has plenty of ; what i find myself lacking as a patron here is personality - even though i get the feeling that , this is by design and not by accident . <sssss> the food . <sssss> you know what , i only had appetizers . <sssss> i had most of the appetizers on the menu , and nothing had a wow factor . <sssss> it just was n't there . <sssss> maybe i should come back at another time , but then again for the price i just expect more adventure than a carefully designed meal that does n't stick out in its defense to please the masses . <sssss> the beer . <sssss> yes i had the beers . <sssss> several from the whole spectrum , and if i had to recommend a malty beverage i 'd say i would recommend the märzenbier -lrb- or they call it märzen -rrb- . <sssss> its color is darker than its taste , but i found it very pleasurable . <sssss> in fact i think all the beers are worth a sample in this place . <sssss> the service . <sssss> i 'd say that the service is extremely professional . <sssss> from the greeter , to the personable waiter/waitress couple that served our party . <sssss> i can believe that the service will depend on the party , and if you look like you are not fitting the desired clientele , you might receive a lesser service . <sssss> with that said , service for me was great . <sssss> the overall . <sssss> for a business casual lunch/dinner meeting , i think this place is the place . <sssss> especially if the client you are trying to grease is a beer drinker -lrb- even if they have other very tasty drinks -rrb- . <sssss> but for the average guy -lrb- me -rrb- it is the kind of establishment franchise i am actively trying to avoid . <sssss> it 's too bland for me , and the price for stated blandness is too high . <sssss> if i only consider service then i would be all for it , but i am a foodie so i ca n't stand behind that .
?		stopped here for a quick pit stop , had a car full of uniformed person ell and that caught the employees attention . <sssss> this being said , my experience could have been skewed by this . <sssss> my beverage was great , and that was the general consensus . <sssss> the service was infallible and perky . <sssss> everything was with a smile . <sssss> . <sssss> but what caught me was the phrase `` taste it , if you do n't like it you get something else '' - now that something i usually just have seen written on the wall with paint in small mexican restaurants . <sssss> i like it ! <sssss> it 's all you want/need in a small drive-through coffee joint - i will come back .
?		who does n't love a good movie and a clean theater ? <sssss> yep , that sums it up . <sssss> i usually frequent this place during the week and i do n't have too many troubles getting tickets . <sssss> what is unfortunate is that there is one person at the customer service desk who you can buy tickets from and depending on the week , the line is extra long which sucks if you are cutting it close for a movie . <sssss> the other thing i 'd love for them to figure out is how can one scan their amc card at the self-service kiosk . <sssss> grr at that .
?		hidden gem . <sssss> . <sssss> scary exterior -lrb- especially if you are n't from the area -rrb- . <sssss> so we found this place on yelp . <sssss> . <sssss> drove around a few times and then when we found it , we could n't believe this place was actually where we were thinking about having dinner . <sssss> the area is less than inviting and at night it feels destitute . <sssss> we decide to take a chance and the interior is warm and bright . <sssss> patrons are enjoying themselves and we are greeted with big smiles by the waitress . <sssss> we were seated and served this pretty tasty ceviche tosta on the house . <sssss> we also ordered a separate order of ceviche , that was n't as good and took forever to come out . <sssss> but skipping on to the entrees , people were pleasantly surprised . <sssss> . <sssss> ranging from my vegan co-worker to my meat head only co-worker . <sssss> i had the fish in red sauce with rice and beans which was awesome . <sssss> my vegan friend had the enchiladas with green sauce which was also tasty . <sssss> i did hear the drinks were not that tasty . <sssss> . <sssss> so be wary of the margaritas . <sssss> good food , reasonable price . <sssss> i 'd give it a 2nd go .
?		`` vegetarian never tasted soo good '' no really , i have been continually impressed . <sssss> i have been here about 3-4 times and this place has yet to disappoint . <sssss> so let 's talk about some of the things i 've had : spicy buffalo `` wings '' chili fries crab puffs egglessrolls samosas lemon pesto -lrb- with noodles and chicken -rrb- big wac -lrb- play on the big mac vegetarian style -rrb- sloppy joe -lrb- soy chorizo -rrb- i mean . <sssss> . <sssss> this place was soo good , i convinced my meat-loving co-workers to come with and even they make requests to go back . <sssss> that 's when you know you are on to something . <sssss> let 's talk about the people : fantastic . <sssss> they are patient , answer all of your questions , help you to explore the menu , sauces , sides . <sssss> do n't like something . <sssss> . <sssss> no problem ! <sssss> they are happy to resolve -lrb- this has n't happened to me , but they thought it did and pulled out the red carpet -rrb- . <sssss> the place is super cozy and cute . <sssss> most importantly . <sssss> . <sssss> you are in and out quickly and they bring your food as it is prepared . <sssss> love this place !
?		the taqueria is the place to go . <sssss> it 's fast and pretty good . <sssss> i 'm a huge fan of the veggie burrito and chipotle potatoes . <sssss> both are to die for ! <sssss> that being said , the rest of the menu is good , but nothing spectacular . <sssss> the service is hit or miss , but the veggie burro is completely worth it .
?		delicious new mexican cuisine ! <sssss> they do n't do mild . <sssss> the staff is friendly and will keep you glass full , but beware that it 's not the quickest service . <sssss> this is definately a place to go and unwind and take your time eating . <sssss> food - i 've never had anything i did n't like here . <sssss> the adovada ribs are great and ridiculously hot . <sssss> but my personal fav , is the spicy guacamole , made fresh and guaranteed to make you sweat . <sssss> the red chili burro enchilada style another hit out of the ballpark . <sssss> they used to have a great green chili stew , but sadly it 's was a limited time menu item .
?		holy delicious sopapilla batman !! <sssss> the bean dip is fantastic , almost filled me to much for the good good at dinner . <sssss> prepare to have you food smothered in delicious sauce !
?		hands down , best donuts in the valley . <sssss> all the locations are great . <sssss> most are open 24 - 7 and the flavor is fantastic . <sssss> it 's a great pickup for a morning office meeting or an even better late night snack after a night of fun . <sssss> my personal fav is the pink icing with sprinkles , although the caramel long john is quickly catching up . <sssss> i could go there every day .
?		i seriously love this restaurant . <sssss> it 's an awesome contribution to kierland commons . <sssss> the bar is great - bartenders are always fun . <sssss> the menu is superb - i 've never had a bad meal here . <sssss> i love their homemade chip/crisps things . <sssss> they literally melt in your mouth ! <sssss> it can suck if you want to go there for dinner because you 'll have to wait for a table , but hanging out in kierland never sucks . <sssss> there 's always great people watching ! <sssss> i really like to sit in their comfy outdoor seating on a summer day and have a cocktail or five ! <sssss> their pretty creative with their drinks as well . <sssss> troy the bartender always whips up something new if you ask him for it . <sssss> i always have a great time here !
?		i danced my ass off one night here ! <sssss> had a blast , but thank god i did n't have to pay for the drinks ! <sssss> somehow we got passed the cover at the door too . <sssss> the decor is really posh/random . <sssss> i do n't remember much , but i know it did n't suck but i 'm pretty sure that 's because the people i was with were awesome ... not the place .
?		gross ! <sssss> their tortilla soup tasted like vomit . <sssss> after two spoons full i proceeded to throw up in the bathroom ! <sssss> never eating there again !
?		i used to be a student and this place was awesome for studying and keeping caffeinated . <sssss> now though , when i go there to relax , i feel like i 'm sitting in a study hall with a coffee bar in it . <sssss> more power to them for catering to students , we all know these places are hard to find . <sssss> but , if you 're a few years graduated , you may want to try somewhere else ... or just get their coffee to go -lrb- it 's very tasty -rrb- .
?		laid back , great beer , and a menu packed with variety for everyone . <sssss> we sat on the outside patio and enjoyed lunch . <sssss> i got the portabella veggie beer bread since i had no idea what to expect from the name alone ! <sssss> turns out , it is lots of veggies and lots -lrb- maybe too much -rrb- cheese rolled in a tasty beer bread wrap . <sssss> very good , and of course , the french fries were awesome too . <sssss> friendly service , even the chef came out to check on our table -lrb- he was yummy too ! <sssss> -rrb- this was the first time i had been to this location , since i 'm from tempe and usually frequent the original . <sssss> it was clean and had normal brewery decor , but it 's hard to beat the tempe location with the actual beer brewing gear and old charming character . <sssss> definitely check this place out if you 're in the area .
?		although i 've never eaten in the dining room , i am a regular at the bar , and have a great time every time ! <sssss> the bartenders and cocktail waitresses are always so nice , and the band on weekends is super entertaining . <sssss> i always know i can come here and have a relaxing night out in a dimly lit atmosphere with good bar food . <sssss> maybe i 'll go there tonight : -rrb-
?		cute and affordable . <sssss> finally an alternative that i actually want to go to ! <sssss> every time i try to break away from the corporate coffee chains , i get burned because their lattes taste like dirt , or they act like they 've never heard of soy milk . <sssss> come on people ! <sssss> that 's what i loved about this place , the staff actually knew what they were doing , and the menu included all the necessities , plus a few of their own creations ! <sssss> try the mint mocha ... uh , yum ! <sssss> they make a great soy vanilla latte too .
?		once we found this place -lrb- i think we did 3 u-turns -rrb- , we were happy with what was at the end of the treasure hunt . <sssss> this little coffee house is adorable . <sssss> it 's got a boutique in the same space , it has a groovy selection of furniture , lots of floor to ceiling windows , and a friendly staff ... not to mention my new favorite drink ! <sssss> i 'm always a sucker for my vanilla soy lattes , but this place makes a honey vanilla latte that makes my knees weak . <sssss> such a small addition , such a big impact . <sssss> all i can say is , please invest in a sign . <sssss> if i had less determination i would have gone somewhere else , or assumed you were out of business .
?		mi patio is a solid 3 star restaurant . <sssss> some days the food tastes better than others . <sssss> and some days the entertainment value is better than others . <sssss> but it 's not a chain , it 's within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas . <sssss> there 's no bike rack -lrb- ugh -rrb- and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings -lrb- which i happen to like -rrb- .
